QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	on in the market right now the first set	3.84	3.479
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	of people they believe that you know	6.0	2.94
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	what the U.S market has corrected by	7.319	4.381

QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	middle so what they are simply saying is	30.72	2.999

QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	us kick start our conversation and let	79.439	3.481
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	me give you a very quick macro Viewpoint	81.0	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that I have and then I will talk about	82.92	3.96
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	five specific stocks so here you can	84.72	4.38
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	take a look at the overall priceiness of	86.88	3.84
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	the Indian market so this is nifty 50	89.1	3.24
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	chart and what you will notice is that	90.72	4.759
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	this is 2018 almost right and this is	92.34	5.88
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	2023 beginning so this is roughly four	95.479	4.901
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	and a half years and how much has our	98.22	5.7
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	markets given it's 51 percent so on a	100.38	5.46
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	kagger basis how much does this come out	103.92	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	to be so it would come out to be roughly	105.84	3.84
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	nine nine and a half percent kagger now	107.64	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	you tell me in the comment box and	109.68	3.479
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	seriously please pause the video and	111.24	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	comment below that do you think that	113.159	3.841
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	markets are currently hyper overvalued	114.84	4.44
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	the short answer according to me is no I	117.0	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	don't think that the market markets are	119.28	4.199
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	overvalued yes it is 100 correct that a	120.54	4.98
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	lot of overvalued stocks in the past	123.479	4.5
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	have corrected or are correcting and are	125.52	4.439
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	going to correct so with that spirit in	127.979	4.021
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	mind let me speak about five specific	129.959	4.321
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	assets that I am bullish about and I am	132.0	4.26
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	investing my money in or I'm likely to	134.28	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	invest my money in so the first talk	136.26	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that I'm going to speak about is D Mart	138.18	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	now from the top how much has the stock	140.16	3.96
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	corrected by it has corrected by roughly	142.08	4.62
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	35 so a natural question comes that here	144.12	4.38
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	is dmart going to fall more is it going	146.7	3.42
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	to rise from this point what is going to	148.5	3.12
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	happen tomorrow can you write it on a	150.12	3.24
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	stamp paper and give me no I can't do	151.62	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that and neither can I predict what is	153.36	3.12
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	going to happen with the stock in the	155.16	3.48
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	next seven days but what I know for a	156.48	3.899
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	fact that dmart is a good company there	158.64	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	is no fundamental issue with dmart why	160.379	3.781

QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	with you and then I will come back to	167.4	4.08
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	technicals so here is the sales data and	169.26	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	you can see that sales has been going up	171.48	3.06
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	massively profits have been going up	172.98	3.18
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	massively there has been no problem with	174.54	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	sales and profits now the next question	176.16	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that people throw at me is that you know	178.26	3.18
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	what inflation is high in the economy	179.7	3.78
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	people are not buying stuff growth is	181.44	4.019
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	slowing down yes agree but please think	183.48	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	about what type of product does dmart	185.459	3.661
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	sell is it selling like luxury cars	187.2	3.48
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	luxury watches and people are paying	189.12	4.02
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	like super premium products no dmart is	190.68	4.44
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	a cost effective product game what they	193.14	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	are playing they simply go out build	195.12	4.259
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	more stores sell fmcg slash retail	197.04	4.619
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	products at lower prices and replace it	199.379	3.901
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	with their own house products that is	201.659	3.121
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	what they are doing so high inflation	203.28	3.36
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	High interest rate this that is it going	204.78	4.2
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	to impact dmat so at least in the next	206.64	4.08
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	two years it is not going to impact and	208.98	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	neither it is impacting the business as	210.72	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	of now yes small bumps here and there	212.58	3.18
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	might keep on happening that you know	214.44	3.24
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	what there's some supply chain issue or	215.76	4.199
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	interest rate went up so dmat stopped	217.68	4.44
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	expanding quite aggressively or they are	219.959	4.14
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	not able to procure like sasti debt all	222.12	3.479
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that stuff will keep on happening and	224.099	3.601
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	yes it will impact the growth prospects	225.599	4.021
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	of the firm and that is precisely what	227.7	3.66
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	has happened with business so from a	229.62	3.24
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	fundamental standpoint there is no	231.36	3.36
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	problem with dmart's business now comes	232.86	3.48
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	the natural question then why why did	234.72	4.439
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	the stock fell by almost 35 so for that	236.34	4.92
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	let me go to to the technicals so number	239.159	4.44
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	one reason why dmart is now falling is	241.26	5.039
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	this that from the period 2020 all the	243.599	5.7
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	way till here it gave almost 350 percent	246.299	5.281
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	runoff so the run-up itself was quite	249.299	4.381
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	aggressive but if you do these stock	251.58	4.379
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	analysis from 2018 onwards so let me do	253.68	4.559
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that so this is 2018 and if you consider	255.959	4.62
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	the five-year return on dmart so it has	258.239	5.041
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	gone up by 127 now many of you would say	260.579	4.021
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that okay this is also very high number	263.28	4.08
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	stock almost giving 127 return in a	264.6	4.62
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	five-year period okay so homework for	267.36	3.66
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	you figure out what is the sales growth	269.22	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	rate and profit growth rate for dmart is	271.02	5.04
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	if this 125 number is not justified then	273.12	4.74
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	dmat technically from a long-term	276.06	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	perspective is not a good buy and if the	277.86	3.839
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	number get Justified then it makes a lot	279.66	4.2
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	of sense to buy something like dmont now	281.699	3.481
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	let me show you another interesting	283.86	3.24
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	point about dmart and this is a	285.18	3.299
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	technical observation what you will	287.1	3.0
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	notice is that whenever the stock Falls	288.479	4.201
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	by roughly 30 percent it gives a run-up	290.1	4.56
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	for example here you can see that the	292.68	4.5
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	stock fell by almost 30 then it gave a	294.66	4.44
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	run-up and how much was this run up so	297.18	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	this run up came out to be almost 100	299.1	4.379
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	percent then it fell again by almost 35	300.72	4.919
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	percent then it gave another set of run	303.479	4.381
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	up from here to here how much was this	305.639	5.28
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	run up this was 210 so now you will see	307.86	4.98
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that from its peak the stock has fallen	310.919	4.681
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	by roughly 35 percent now is it waiting	312.84	4.919
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	to create another run up my bet would be	315.6	5.46
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	I guess for the entire 2020 2021 I	317.759	5.101
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	wanted to buy dmart but I missed the bus	321.06	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	but now I have started to build more	322.86	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	position onto dmont and here is me	324.66	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	investing money live now another point	326.4	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that you need to remember about Dima	328.38	3.539
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	test that how are the current investors	330.0	4.139
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	reacting to the loss in valuation by	331.919	4.081
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	dmart so to say are they abandoning the	334.139	3.421
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	ship so here you can see that promoters	336.0	3.96
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	haven't sold anything fisdi is usually	337.56	4.56
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	maintain around 15 they have kept that	339.96	3.959
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	intact so hardly any change happening	342.12	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	here so so it's not as if that from a	343.919	3.961
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	current investor Viewpoint they are not	345.72	4.14
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	believing in the valuation that dmart is	347.88	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	getting now of course no one can predict	349.86	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	what the real valuation of a company is	351.6	4.08
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	you I anyone else is just kissing here	353.46	4.32
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	but looking all these factors I believe	355.68	3.959
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that dmart is a good fundamental stock	357.78	3.84
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	to consider right now now moving on to	359.639	3.361
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	the second stock that I'm going to talk	361.62	3.18
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	about and this is a U.S stock which is	363.0	3.66
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	called as Tesla it is one of the most	364.8	3.899
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	talked about stocks why is that I will	366.66	3.479
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	discuss the reason and there are very	368.699	3.541
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	important lessons so don't skip this	370.139	4.081
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	part just because it is a U.S stock you	372.24	3.78
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	will learn a lot as to why certain	374.22	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	valuations get eroded so here is the	376.02	4.2
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	most interesting part about Tesla which	378.12	4.019
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	is its price that in the last one year	380.22	5.22
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Tesla has corrected by almost 70 percent	382.139	5.4
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	now many people are not liking it and	385.44	3.96
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	they are after Elon musk's life that you	387.539	3.421
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	know what how dare you that stock has	389.4	3.359
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	fallen by 70 where is your focus this	390.96	3.299
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that okay so let us have a quick	392.759	4.38
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	conversation why has Tesla stock fallen	394.259	5.16
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	and is it a good buy right now so fact	397.139	4.68
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	number one is that Tesla grew up in	399.419	4.261
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	value quite aggressively between the	401.819	5.341
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	period 2020 and 2021 end how much just	403.68	5.7
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	take a look at this number so it went	407.16	4.8
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	from here to here so there was a sixteen	409.38	4.68
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	hundred percent return on Tesla's stock	411.96	4.44
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	in that time span of course the stock	414.06	4.5
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	was hyper overvalued and almost crazy	416.4	4.32
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	people were buying test at that price	418.56	4.859
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	point now it has corrected by almost 70	420.72	4.8
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	percent from here to here so if you do	423.419	3.661
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	the map and if you again do this	425.52	4.38
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	analysis from end of 2020 onwards to	427.08	4.559
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	this point so how many years have passed	429.9	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	so almost three years have passed and	431.639	4.5
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	the stock has given 75 return so Point	433.5	4.5
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	number one is that Tesla is falling in	436.139	3.661
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	value right now because it was hyper	438.0	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	inflated stock to begin with so it	439.8	4.38
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	losing 70 value you have to see it in	441.72	4.08
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	the context that it first rose by	444.18	2.94
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	sixteen hundred percent in the first	445.8	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	place Point number two is the fact that	447.12	5.639
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Elon Musk himself sold Tesla's stock he	449.34	4.979
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	has said a lot of stuff that you know	452.759	3.121
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	what I need to buy Twitter therefore I	454.319	3.66
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	am selling Tesla I feel that we have a	455.88	3.539
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	recession ahead therefore I am selling	457.979	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	my stock just to prepare for recession I	459.419	4.081
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	want to create some dry powder now what	461.699	3.301
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	is the meaning of dry powder you let me	463.5	2.88
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	know in the comment box other people	465.0	3.24
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	will also learn from it but to cut the	466.38	3.659
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	long story short and people who can see	468.24	3.84
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	through all this financial mumbo jumbo	470.039	3.841
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	there is a very simple explanation he	472.08	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	himself knew that Tesla stock is hyper	473.88	4.2
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	overvalued he probably did not get that	475.8	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	why crazy people are buying his company	478.08	3.42
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	stock at sixteen hundred percent growth	479.52	4.2
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	and he ended up selling and selling it	481.5	4.139
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	in large number so here is the snippet	483.72	4.02
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	as to how much Tesla stock he has sold	485.639	4.261
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	and he has sold in billions of dollars	487.74	5.1
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	now whenever a promoter sells stake in	489.9	5.04
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	his own company there can be two reasons	492.84	4.259
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	one is that he is making Mota PESA by	494.94	3.78
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	selling it which Elon must definitely	497.099	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	made and the second key reason would be	498.72	3.3
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that he does not believe fundamentally	500.639	3.361
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	in the company so it was a pump and dump	502.02	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	scheme for him so which of these two	504.0	3.479
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	options am I more leaning towards it's	505.62	4.139
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	definitely option A Elon Musk does	507.479	3.961
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	believe in Tesla it's not as if he's	509.759	4.441
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	abandoning Tesla stock all he was simply	511.44	4.2
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	trying to do was that he was trying to	514.2	3.12
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	do profit booking in his own company	515.64	3.42
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	which is absolutely fine there is	517.32	3.48
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	nothing off about it especially if a	519.06	3.0
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	company has given such high crazy	520.8	3.299
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	returns now the third key factor was	522.06	3.899
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	regarding the China Factor so recently	524.099	3.481
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	the news came that you know what the	525.959	3.601
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Chinese slowdown has begun people are	527.58	4.14
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	not buying electric vehicle in China and	529.56	4.32
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	for Tesla China is the second most	531.72	4.2
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	important Market not only from selling	533.88	4.2
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	to its customers but also manufacturing	535.92	4.08
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Tesla so Tesla has a very large Factory	538.08	3.84
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	in China so what is the way ahead	540.0	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	because this is the most important	541.92	3.0
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Prominent Point that you need to	543.54	3.78
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	consider right now in terms of making an	544.92	4.32
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	investment in Tesla or not making an	547.32	3.66
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	investment in Tesla so the first key	549.24	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	aspect that you need to consider is that	550.98	4.32
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	what is the Elon musk's valuation	553.14	4.62
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	premium that was assigned to Tesla and	555.3	4.68
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	to what extent has it been faded so here	557.76	3.78
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	was a very interesting study that was	559.98	4.44
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	done by refine it IV data stream so	561.54	4.38
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	basically what they have pointed out is	564.42	3.479
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that hey at one point in time there was	565.92	3.96
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	a specific premium that was assigned to	567.899	4.201
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Tesla because Elon Musk was the lead	569.88	4.44
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	promoter and in now that premium is	572.1	4.02
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	wearing off and it is reaching similar	574.32	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	valuation to other Automotive players so	576.12	3.779
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	this Elon mus premium has gone away	578.22	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	second key announcement that Elon Musk	579.899	3.421
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	has made us that I am not going to sell	581.82	4.139
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	any more Tesla stock till 2024. I will	583.32	4.019
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	say that you know what Elon Musk is a	585.959	3.181
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	dog lines on how should we trust Elon	587.339	3.18
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Musk why should we believe what he's	589.14	3.0
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	saying okay don't believe him but	590.519	3.241
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	believe the logic now why would he sell	592.14	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	his stock now when it is trading at a 70	593.76	4.259
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	fee this gives you another interesting	595.74	4.92
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	perspective the 2020 the fourth I am not	598.019	4.141

QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	recovery phase for Tesla now many of you	604.14	3.42
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	asked me that hey how do we buy like U.S	605.88	3.42

QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Bajaj Finance Bajaj Finance talk just	621.06	4.92
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	yesterday corrected by almost eight	623.7	4.199
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	eight and a half percent and today it	625.98	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	fell by roughly two percent and finally	627.899	4.261
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	I decided to build more of my positions	629.88	4.2
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	in Bajaj Finance so let us understand	632.16	3.84
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	the entire quick story about Bajaj	634.08	3.78
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	finance and if you want I will do a deep	636.0	3.66
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	dive into Bajaj Finance talk so let me	637.86	3.539
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	know in the comment box but here is a	639.66	3.06
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	very quick snippet that you need to	641.399	3.06
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	remember so Point number one is that	642.72	4.02
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Bajaj Finance has fallen by roughly 22	644.459	4.681
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	from its top so this is the first key	646.74	4.44
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	thing that you must notice the second	649.14	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	key point is that hey there is a channel	651.18	3.12
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	trading that is happening in Bajaj	652.74	3.36
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	finance and now two things can happen	654.3	4.02
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	one is that the broad Market on 50 50	656.1	5.04
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	sensex it's stains the 18 000 levels and	658.32	4.86
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	starts climbing up then what is going to	661.14	3.78
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	happen with a stock like Bajaj finances	663.18	3.599
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that from this point and it is already	664.92	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	at this point it will start recovering	666.779	3.781
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	and it will give a very sharp recovery	668.82	4.019
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	scenario 2s that that the entire nifty	670.56	4.86
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	50 or sensex breaks down and as a result	672.839	4.56
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Bajaj Finance corrects more and it can	675.42	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	even go hypothetically till here it	677.399	3.661
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	should not happen that but it is a	679.32	3.48
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	possibility usually whenever we see	681.06	3.66
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	these type of w shaped pattern it	682.8	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	indicates a bullishness so this was	684.72	3.48
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	preparing for a breakout but	686.7	3.12
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	unfortunately it broke down because	688.2	3.36
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	there is high volatility in the market	689.82	3.78
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	right now and as a result Bajaj Finance	691.56	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	also broke down with it now	693.6	3.239
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	unfortunately the narrative in the	695.1	3.12
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	market right now that is being painted	696.839	3.961
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	is that you know what the AUM or asset	698.22	5.4
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	under management for Bajaj Finance has	700.8	5.099
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	gone down so you need to understand that	703.62	3.659
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	there is a difference between growth	705.899	4.221
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	rate slow down and decline in business	707.279	5.101
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	decline in business now what is the	710.12	3.82
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	meaning these are small small words but	712.38	3.42
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	they create a huge impact now business	713.94	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	decline means that you know what the	715.8	3.96
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	sales for let's say 200 crores then the	717.48	4.2
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	sales become like 160 crores now this is	719.76	4.199
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	a decline but in Bajaj Finance case what	721.68	4.38
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	is happening is that let's say that this	723.959	4.021
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	year their sales was 200 crores last	726.06	4.14
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	year it was 190 crores so this was a	727.98	4.68
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	five percent increase right so this year	730.2	4.079
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	what has happened is that instead of a	732.66	3.66
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	five percent increase maybe their growth	734.279	4.081
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	rate increases four percent so it does	736.32	3.48
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	not mean that the business has become	738.36	3.3
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	bad it is just that their growth rate	739.8	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	has slowed down so then comes the next	741.66	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	logical question that hey why has the	743.7	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	growth slowed down and is it like a	745.38	3.899
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Bajaj Finance specific problem or is it	747.24	3.719
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	an entire broad Market problem okay	749.279	3.541
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	think about it this way that what type	750.959	3.781
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	of business model does Bajaj Finance has	752.82	3.66
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	so its business model is fairly simple	754.74	3.599
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that if you are taking small Consumer	756.48	4.5
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	loans fridge bike TV AC this type of	758.339	4.56
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	stuff then you can go and Avail Bajaj	760.98	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Finance Loans so two things are	762.899	3.601
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	happening one is that you tell me that	764.7	3.36
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	interest rates in the economy what are	766.5	3.24
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	they like they are very very high right	768.06	4.079
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	now if you go and take a home loan Emi	769.74	3.96
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	then you will have to pay crazy amount	772.139	3.121
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	of money you will get even with good	773.7	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	credit around nine percent home loan	775.26	3.72
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	rates so these are fairly high right now	777.3	3.9
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	so are you going to take more loans in	778.98	3.96
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	this type of an economy or are you going	781.2	3.6
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	to take less loans the short answer is	782.94	5.28
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	that you will say that is so you will	784.8	5.219
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	push your decision of taking that loan	788.22	4.5
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	so this applies to all types of loans so	790.019	5.041
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	therefore their AUM growth rate has come	792.72	4.02
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	down so please don't mistake it that is	795.06	3.66
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Bajaj Finance has suddenly become a Bad	796.74	4.14
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	Company okay one counter argument that I	798.72	3.66
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	get is that you know what Bajaj Finance	800.88	3.68
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	always trade that a very high premium	802.38	4.68
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	okay so let us very quickly analyze that	804.56	5.079
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	also see just before covet and this is	807.06	4.26
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	how many years this is almost three	809.639	3.541
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	years now so three years how much return	811.32	4.079
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	has it given it has given only 22 return	813.18	4.32
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	from its current levels so you tell me	815.399	3.901

QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	but this is definitely not high for the	858.6	4.38
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	number one paint company in India so if	860.82	3.36

QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	technical viewpoint on this talk then	864.18	3.54
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	there is nothing fundamentally off in	865.86	3.539
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	terms of pricing Point number two that	867.72	3.299

QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	decent discount that is going on on the	875.279	3.36

QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	why was that the case take a look at	899.839	4.481
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	this graph it was simply because of the	902.16	4.32
QSRaMfmwAv8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRaMfmwAv8	point that oil prices went up now	904.32	4.079

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	question that back in 2016 what was your	3.36	5.279
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	mobile phone bill the answer would be	6.779	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	close to 0 because Reliance you had	8.639	4.021
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	recently launched and all of us were	10.679	3.601

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	getting from Reliance but over the years	14.28	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Reliance started hiking its price and	16.26	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	tariff plans and just last year they	18.42	5.519

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	because of Russia's model now what	42.36	3.6
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Russia has to do with it so for that you	44.04	3.6
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	need to understand the backstory and	45.96	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	there is a very important macroeconomic	47.64	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	concept that I will tell you as to how	49.44	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Monopoly businesses distort the living	51.36	4.26

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	lower middle class people so to kick	55.62	3.84

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	question who do you think is the richest	59.46	5.04

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	richest person on earth is Mr Vladimir	68.7	4.98

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	now that is not even the interesting	76.2	3.959
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	part now the interesting part is that if	78.0	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you pick the Apex politician in Russia	80.159	4.561

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	speaking now comes the natural question	87.06	4.68
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that okay why is it the case so to cut	89.159	5.341
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the long story short back in 1991 when	91.74	5.04

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	going to discuss the topic of	182.4	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	responsible monopolies and irresponsible	184.08	4.739
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	monopolies and what exactly are Monopoly	186.48	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	oriented businesses do we need them do	188.819	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	we not need them and how as a common	190.8	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	citizen you should think about this	192.72	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	entire spectrum and Viewpoint you will	194.34	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	understand a lot of Economics Finance	196.44	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	behind whatever I am speaking these type	198.3	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	of videos require a lot of research so	200.519	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	if you do like the content do consider	202.44	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	sharing so okay so let us have a very	204.659	3.541
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	quick conversation as to what is meant	206.22	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	by Monopoly businesses by understanding	208.2	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	two Central terms so the first key thing	210.48	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is that any Monopoly business for	212.58	3.299
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	example if you take a look at the	214.379	3.841
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airports in India there are only going	215.879	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to be limited number of airports once	218.22	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	our entire infrastructure is built now	220.379	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	if one company controls most of that	222.72	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airport it would be called as a very big	224.879	4.321
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	company in that space and one could	227.28	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	argue that it has become a monopoly in	229.2	4.259
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that particular industry now such	231.48	3.839
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	companies have created a very big	233.459	4.321
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	barrier to entry barrier to entry means	235.319	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that for example let's imagine that	237.78	3.179
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	there are only three 100 airports in	239.159	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	India that can eventually be built and	240.959	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	one of these companies control 200 such	242.879	4.381
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airports now can other people come and	244.86	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	create another airport in Delhi it is	247.26	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	very very unlikely because Delhi at Max	249.18	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	might have two airports or maybe three	250.98	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airports eventually in the next 50 60	252.72	4.799
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	years so from that perspective very high	255.06	4.859
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	barriers to entry have been created and	257.519	4.981
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	no new competition can come so now comes	259.919	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the natural question that you know what	262.5	3.3
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	does it mean that we should not give	263.759	4.681
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	private players an opportunity to become	265.8	4.92
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	these type of monopolies or is it okay	268.44	4.319
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	for government to hand over this type of	270.72	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	work to certain private players now this	272.759	4.081
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	becomes a highly debatable issue	275.28	3.6
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	sometimes it takes a nationalistic color	276.84	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	for example I get so much heat that you	278.88	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	know what you are speaking against adani	281.1	3.18
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	ji he's doing like such great work yes	282.66	3.36
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	yes he is doing amazing work I	284.28	3.359
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	completely respect it but please	286.02	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	understand that I am speaking from an	287.639	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	economics Viewpoint consider in this	289.44	4.259
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	simple example that out of 300 airports	291.54	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	hypothetically if 200 are controlled by	293.699	4.081
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	adaniji then what is going to happen to	295.74	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you and I as common citizen then it is	297.78	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	very very likely that like the Reliance	300.12	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	your story that they are now jacking up	302.04	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the prices for everything because there	303.9	3.12
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are hardly two three players left in the	305.46	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Telecom space similarly if one company	307.02	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	controls 200 airports you will pay more	309.24	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money for the burgers that you eat or	311.52	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the book that you buy or the taxes that	313.139	3.721
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you pay for taking your flights the	315.06	4.139
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	parking space that you procure etc etc	316.86	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	now you might have a natural response	319.199	2.821
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that if they increase their flight	320.94	2.88
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	ticket prices then I'll stop using the	322.02	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airlines altogether well very good now	323.82	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	can you travel from Kashmir to	325.919	3.481
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	kanyakumari in bus well maybe you can	327.36	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	maybe you can't but it will take a lot	329.4	4.019
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	of time and for a lot of people taking a	331.259	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	bus or a car is not feasible at all this	333.419	4.62
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is a highly important product that will	335.639	4.741
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	be used by people and it will not have a	338.039	4.741
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	very high elasticity of demand so I hope	340.38	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that you got the perspective and there	342.78	3.24
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is no clear line whether the government	344.46	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	should Outsource these Monopoly oriented	346.02	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	businesses to the private sector or not	348.6	4.319
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	but there has to be a certain oversight	350.58	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and you tell me whether this is being	352.919	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	done in a responsible way again not	354.479	4.141
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	targeting any particular party this has	356.759	3.361
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	been done by a bunch of different	358.62	3.419
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	political parties so I will just leave	360.12	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that conversation there so now comes the	362.039	3.421
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	second point that even if you assume	363.78	3.06
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that you know what government cannot be	365.46	3.179
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	everywhere it cannot manage like ports	366.84	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	it cannot run like power companies it	368.639	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	cannot do like 500 different things it	370.38	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	has to bring in private players so then	372.6	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	there is a difference between creating	374.82	4.379
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	responsible monopolies and irresponsible	376.44	4.86
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	monopolies now this is a tweet that I've	379.199	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	done and I will name the groups directly	381.3	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	so I compared the Tata group with adani	383.039	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	group and look at the hate that I got I	385.08	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	just simply presented facts and the fact	386.94	5.28
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	was that it will take 16.4 years for	388.979	6.0
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	adanis to repay their debt and it will	392.22	5.22
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	only take 1.5 years for the Tata group	394.979	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to repay their debt now you'll say that	397.44	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	okay how did you get this number can you	399.539	3.421
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	show some math behind it absolutely here	401.1	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is the math behind it and this is called	402.96	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	as cash flow to debt ratio and you can	404.52	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	see that for the adani group and these	406.86	3.839
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	numbers are from September so now the	408.78	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	situation will be even more worse so the	410.699	3.381
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	total group was	412.74	5.1
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	936.6 and here it was 1216.6 billion	414.08	6.339
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	rupees so if you take a look at their	417.84	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	free cash flow so free cash flow simply	420.419	2.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	means	422.1	3.18
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	right I mean how much money they are	423.199	4.0
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	eventually getting so from that simple	425.28	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	perspective if you do this entire	427.199	4.861
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	analysis you get this repayment time so	429.0	5.1
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that is how you reach a number that if	432.06	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you compare it to the Tata group they	434.1	3.599
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are also creating certain monopolies in	435.84	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	certain industries for example Tata salt	437.699	3.661
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	could be considered as a monopoly	439.68	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	similarly they control a lot of power	441.36	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	business etc etc but the point is that	443.16	4.979
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the Tata group has grown sensibly and	445.86	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	organically or to a very large extent	448.139	4.321
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	organically there has not been a	450.12	4.859
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	dramatic Rise by taking on public debt	452.46	3.6
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	so I will speak about this point	454.979	3.181
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	subsequently but I hope you got this	456.06	4.139
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	number where I got that from and you	458.16	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	tell me whether this is a worrying	460.199	3.361
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	situation or not please be a little bit	461.58	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	rational I'm not trying to sway you from	463.56	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	one way to the other I'm simply trying	465.66	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to bring forth the Viewpoint what is the	467.52	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	difference between a responsible	469.62	3.479
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Monopoly creation with service and	470.94	4.199
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	irresponsible Monopoly creation so let's	473.099	4.081
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	move on and let's try to take a look as	475.139	4.141
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to what the hidden incentives are for	477.18	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	example if the Tata group ends up	479.28	4.62
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	becoming a big Monopoly who is it that	481.44	4.379
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	eventually benefits vis-a-vis let's do	483.9	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the same comparison for adani group so	485.819	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	here is the entire roadmap of the Tata	487.86	4.559
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Empire and they own all these different	490.139	5.28
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	companies and just for context 66	492.419	6.661
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	percent of this entire space is owned by	495.419	6.361
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	a company called as Tata Sons right Tata	499.08	5.339
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Suns now what is the Tata Sun Tata Suns	501.78	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is run by two different trusts and they	504.419	4.441
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	donate a large chunk or a major chunk of	506.52	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that money to different philanthropies	508.86	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	so if the Tata group becomes big most of	510.419	4.8
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that money would be donated in form of	513.24	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Charities now would similar be the case	515.219	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	in adani groups so who owns the adani	517.5	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	group so again here is the snippet and	519.959	3.301
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you can see that it is owned and	521.64	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	operated by the adani family so here is	523.26	4.139
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the entire roadmap and I will present	525.72	3.36
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	some Finance around it so that this	527.399	3.361
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	concept sticks so there are four	529.08	2.939
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	specific points that you need to	530.76	2.94
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	understand see if there is an	532.019	3.541
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	independent business for example I have	533.7	3.36
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	started this company called as wisdom	535.56	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	hatch and if I do a wonderful job and if	537.06	4.62
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	I am able to educate every single person	539.76	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	about finance and in that process I	541.68	3.659
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	become a multi-billionaire there is	543.839	3.06
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	nothing wrong why because this is a	545.339	3.0
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	private business that I've started I	546.899	3.06
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	have not taken anyone's money I am not	548.339	3.301
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	burning anyone's money I'm not taking	549.959	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Public's money this is entirely a	551.64	4.319
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	private business but on the flip side	553.86	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	what majority of these infrastructure	555.959	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	driven monopolies for example Tata is	558.18	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	also an infrastructure driven Monopoly	560.339	4.381
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and adanis are also an infrastructure	562.2	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	driven monopolies what do they typically	564.72	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	do okay so this is how the flow works	566.64	5.1
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and they end up procuring a lot of debt	568.92	5.16
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	from banks for example recently Bank of	571.74	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Baroda made the announcement that they	574.08	2.819
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are going to lend more money to the	575.64	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Irani group similarly LIC it is not a	576.899	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	bank but again it is funded by public	579.18	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money so all these institutes give one	580.86	4.68
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	form of debt or the other to these big	583.5	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	monopolies so how are they getting their	585.54	4.919
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money to go and build airports go and	587.88	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	build ports how are they doing it well	590.459	3.841
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	by procuring public money one way or the	592.08	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	other then what happens they end up	594.3	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	creating a monopoly now then you need to	596.22	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	take a look at the most important step	598.44	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that hey when this entire Monopoly is	600.3	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	created two things are going to happen	602.58	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	either that company is going to win it	604.08	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is going to become really big who	606.3	3.539
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	benefits in that case in tata's case	607.92	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	they end up giving majority of it to	609.839	3.781
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	charity and you make the same analysis	611.64	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	for the adani group but in the event	613.62	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	these businesses fail then what happens	615.6	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	well then we go to step one that it is	617.76	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the public that will end up footing the	620.16	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	bill for their failure how exactly I'll	622.32	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	explain that subsequently but I hope you	624.42	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	got this complex Financial story as to	626.64	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	what is a responsible Monopoly versus	628.74	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	irresponsible Monopoly now coming back	630.72	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to the initial graph that I had shown	633.18	3.839
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you that hey in the event the Tata	634.86	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	groups business fail or the likely	637.019	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	failure of Tata groups business what is	639.0	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the probability of that it is fairly low	640.98	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	why because again take a look at that	643.26	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	number that their debt payment cycle is	645.24	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	fairly small it has been designed or	647.76	4.259
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	managed in such a way on the flip side	649.98	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	take a look at the debt repayment	652.019	3.781
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	capacity of the adani group how soon	653.7	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	they can liquidate their assets and pay	655.8	3.18
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	back all these things need to be	657.54	3.359
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	considered so that is the Viewpoint that	658.98	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is entirely data driven please form your	660.899	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	own opinions you don't need to trust my	662.94	4.8
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	words on it just simply look at publicly	664.86	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	available data so then comes the natural	667.74	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	question that from time to time	669.6	3.299
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	different governments I'm saying	671.16	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	governments not government so from time	672.899	3.301
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to time different governments have	674.7	3.3
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	partnered up with different business	676.2	4.259
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	groups in order to give a part of	678.0	4.68
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	publicly run businesses and convert them	680.459	4.201
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	into private businesses so to say why	682.68	3.779
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are the PPP or public private	684.66	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	partnership model there is nothing wrong	686.459	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	with it again as long as it is being	688.5	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	done responsibly it is completely fine	690.36	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	if the group is sensible if the group	692.399	4.141
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	has good intent all those are good	694.56	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	things nothing wrong with it but see you	696.54	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	need to understand the pace at which	698.76	4.019
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	this game is being played think about it	700.74	3.779
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	this way that if you are giving Publix	702.779	4.201
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money to some private business and	704.519	4.861
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	asking them to create ports airports Etc	706.98	4.979
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and if they ask that you know what give	709.38	4.68
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	us like 10 000 crore of money or twenty	711.959	3.421
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	thousand fifty thousand crore of money	714.06	3.36
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	next year again give us 50 000 more of	715.38	3.6
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money we will create like more airports	717.42	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	this is is just too fast an expansion so	718.98	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	please keep that in mind and just for	721.26	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	context let us pick the case study for	723.0	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airports just to show how irresponsibly	724.92	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	this has been done there are eight	727.14	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	public private partnership run airports	728.82	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	in India seven of them have gone to	731.16	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	adani you tell me whether this is being	732.899	3.781
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	done sensibly or not now I will not	734.64	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	speak more otherwise this issue becomes	736.68	3.839
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	political but I hope you are able to	738.48	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	draw your own inferences out of it now	740.519	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you might have a natural response that	742.86	3.3
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	why this airport thing is being blown	744.42	3.3
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	out of proportion everyone is talking	746.16	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	about it why is that the case so let us	747.72	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	pick case study of another country how	749.88	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	their airports is run so here is the	751.86	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	American case study and there only one	753.72	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airport is such which is not run by	755.94	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	their local or central government all	758.16	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	else is government controlled so that is	760.019	3.841
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	a simple point they are not privatized	762.06	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	of course we can get into entire debate	763.86	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that in the US a lot of businesses are	765.779	3.781
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	privately run for example healthcare	768.06	3.06
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	companies I get it but here I'm just	769.56	3.18
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	picking the case study of airports	771.12	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	because the Indian airport business is	772.74	3.599
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	going to become one of the most	774.839	3.721
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	lucrative businesses going forward in	776.339	4.021
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the world in terms of domestic traffic	778.56	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that we are getting in terms of the	780.36	3.36
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	wealth growth that is happening in India	782.04	3.419
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	so this needs to be looked further into	783.72	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	so now comes the final piece of the	785.459	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	puzzle as to how this entire mechanism	787.2	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is played out well it is done by the	789.36	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Banks and recently I was surprised to	791.279	5.041
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	read the commentary of CEO MD of Bank of	793.5	4.86
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Baroda who literally said that we will	796.32	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	continue to lend money to the adani	798.36	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	group as long as they meet our	800.399	3.481
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	underwriting standards and I'll say okay	802.2	2.939
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	what is wrong with this they will	803.88	2.579
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	continue to lend to a particular	805.139	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	business okay he went on to add that I	806.459	4.261
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	do not bother about the stock market	809.04	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	volatility well you should bother	810.72	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	because Bank of Baroda is not a private	812.7	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	bank and you're not lending your own	814.62	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money you are lending Public's money and	816.12	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	if some company whom you have lent money	818.339	3.481
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to it is going through an uncertain	820.2	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	period Then you have to hold on you	821.82	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	can't give public statements like that	823.98	3.12
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you know what we will continue to lend	825.48	3.18
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	them now you might say that akshat you	827.1	3.359
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	have some hidden agenda do you know more	828.66	4.619
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	about banking than MD CEOs no I do not	830.459	4.741
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	but here is the track record that I can	833.279	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	see that over the last 10 years this is	835.2	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the amount of public money that bank of	837.24	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that has lost so when they talk about	839.16	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	their underwriting standards please take	841.2	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	it with a grain of salt and I as a	843.06	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	common citizen has every right to ask	845.16	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	these type of questions it does not make	847.2	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	me biased it just simply makes me	849.18	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	logical a person who takes a look at	850.86	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	data and asks relevant questions and	852.66	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that is the same approach I would	854.88	3.12
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	encourage you to understand now given	856.2	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	how complicated the finance world is the	858.0	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	lending space is all this is given a	860.16	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	nationalistic color right now for	862.56	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	example akshat is against Indians	864.06	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	getting loans from Indian banks no that	865.98	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is not the point that is the reason why	868.139	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	I brought the example of tatas I am not	870.18	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	against businesses getting loans but you	872.399	3.841
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	please need to understand the difference	874.62	3.659
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	between responsible and irresponsible	876.24	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	monopolies whether we require them in	878.279	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the first place if they are being	880.8	3.479
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	financed by banks with poor track record	882.24	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and there is brazenness associated with	884.279	3.841
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the fact that we'll continue to lend	886.62	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	however we wanted our underwriting	888.12	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	standards are strong but our track	890.04	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	record shows otherwise that is just	891.839	4.201
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	plain wrong so Point number one is that	893.94	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Banks should support private groups	896.04	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	there is no harm in that but they should	897.839	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	support responsible lending that is a	900.24	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	simple message that I'll leave you with	902.399	3.24
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Point number two monopolies should be	903.66	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	built when required we do not probably	905.639	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	require monopolies in every sector every	907.62	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	space of the domain just because private	910.079	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	sector is better every time a monopoly	911.94	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is built few years down the line the jio	914.279	3.721
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	example plays out that they will	916.68	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	continue to raise prices do whatever you	918.0	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	like I can guarantee you that whatever	920.1	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	your mobile bill is today in 2023 you	921.72	5.28
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are going to pay 2x of that by 2028.	924.42	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Third and very important point is that	927.0	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	please do not confuse nationalism with a	928.8	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	private business that benefits a	931.32	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	specific family those two are very very	932.94	3.839
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	different thing if some Indian company	934.98	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is doing an amazing job we should all	936.779	4.441
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Lord that effort no doubt about that but	938.94	4.259
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that does not give them a leeway to keep	941.22	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	things unclear then comes the fourth	943.199	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	point that the public money needs to be	945.06	4.139
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	spent responsibly we should not have	947.16	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	problems like like you know what banks	949.199	3.301
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are just lending that banks are not even	950.94	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	able to recover 25 of their bad loans	952.5	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	well it is very easy for me to shut up	955.019	4.081
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and not speak about these topics but I	957.24	3.599
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	took a stand I hope that you would	959.1	3.479
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	support me why because of the simple	960.839	4.081
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	fact that back when Vijay mallya niram	962.579	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Modi took loans ran away and now Vijay	964.92	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	mallya actually sits on his Twitter on	966.839	3.541
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	every bank holiday tweets about and	968.639	3.301
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	mocks Indian citizens that was	970.38	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	irresponsible capitalism and I hope that	971.94	4.019
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	people do not lose their sense of what	974.16	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is real and what is not and preserve	975.959	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	their sense of data analysis and taking	978.18	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	decisions using their brain because God	980.339	3.721
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	has given all of us our brain please	982.32	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	look at facts independently and please	984.06	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	reach a conclusion and please do not	985.86	3.659
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	associate everything with nationalistic	987.779	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	pride hope you enjoyed this video please	989.519	2.94

i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	In the world of stock trading, its so easy  to get overwhelmed and lost in the endless	0.0	4.92
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	abyss of information that s out there.  There s free ebooks, paid courses, and scammy	4.92	5.7
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	youtubers. and its extremely hard to decipher what  s good information and what s bad information.	10.62	8.46
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	As someone who has had to go through  the exact same scenario myself.	19.08	3.704
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	(Yep that s me) I found it extremely	22.784	1.576
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	annoying. So that s why im making this exact  video. So you can cut out all the bullshit	24.36	4.5
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	and get a complete A-Z guide on how to start  trading stocks if you are complete beginner.	28.86	4.86
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Now im not going to do the usual YouTuber approach  where I wrap this all up in a nice little bow and	33.72	5.46
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	make you pay $299 for my course. The best part of this series,	39.18	4.2
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	its completely free. (free realestate)	43.38	2.34
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Now after trading for around 8 years, I can  say there s a lot of information we have to	46.32	5.04
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	swim through. My job is to go over that  information in a simplistic and efficient	51.36	4.32
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	way so you can understand the maximum amount  of information possible in the shortest amount	55.68	5.04
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	of time. That s the goal at least. Now theres a specific question I get	60.72	4.08
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	asked most almost every single day in my comment  section from new traders. Trader after trader	64.8	5.22
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	asking the same, exact, question. That question is .	70.02	4.98
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	How much money do I need to start trading? And my answer, might just surprise you. Is	75.0	7.08
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	it $100? Is it $1,000? Is it $10,000?  What if I told you the answer is $0.	82.08	12.72
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Let me explain.  One of the biggest mistakes beginner traders make	98.22	3.84
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	is they just instantly jump in the market with  their life savings without any experience at all.	102.06	4.98
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Just because they saw some Stock tiktok trader in  front of a lambo and thought hey that looks fun .	107.04	5.46
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Considering they have no experience, they  lose all of their money, then end up saying	112.5	4.26
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	ahh maybe this isn t for me . Then end up  quitting, and never try to trade stocks again.	116.76	5.22
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	And the sad part is, this is what  happens to a majority of traders.	126.54	4.08
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	What I m about to tell you, is how you  can completely avoid that all together,	130.62	3.9
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	so this doesn t happen to you. There are devices called trading simulators	134.52	4.44
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	or paper trading. Which is basically a platform  where you can trade with fake money so you can	138.96	5.22
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	test things out. Test different strategies,  test your risk management techniques, test	144.18	4.14

i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Most new traders skip this step, and  honestly its the most crucial step	153.12	4.56
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	out there to become a successful trader.  That s why im listing it as my very step.	157.68	4.92
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	There are a lot of trading simulators out  there. Some are paid, some are free. But	162.6	4.8
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	the one that I would recommend the most is  webull. Just because its free and they have	167.4	4.56
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	a really user friendly dashboard to where  its not really confusing and easy to use.	171.96	5.16
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	So that s what I would recommend if you want  to try one out. Plus I think they give you,	184.74	3.78
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	12 free shares of stock or something like  that if its your first time signing up,	188.52	3.66
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	so that s a good bonus as well.	192.18	1.5
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Ill leave a link in my description if you  want to try out their trading simulator.	193.68	3.06
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	No, this video is not sponsored by webull.  I just recommend them if you don t have a	196.74	4.26
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	trading simulator already. But webull  if you re watching this cough cough.	201.0	3.96
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	So what I would recommend doing is  getting on webull, start paper trading,	204.96	4.2
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	and just do what you would normally do  if it was real money. But the trick is,	209.16	4.14
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	you have to act like this fake paper trading  money is real. Act like its your actual capital.	213.3	5.22
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Put the concepts that im about to teach you in  this video series to the test. But not only that,	218.52	5.58
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	take it a step further. Record  every single trade you take.	224.1	3.78
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	If it was a losing trade. Write down what you  think you did wrong. Did you get greedy? Did you	227.88	4.74
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	move your stop loss? Did you let your emotions get  the best of you? Did you follow your rule set?	232.62	4.5
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Record EVERYTHING. For every single trade. This way, you can look back at what you did	237.12	2.903
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	wrong and instantly fix it there and then.  This will EXPONENTIALLY speed up the	240.023	3.397
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	process of you becoming a better trader. But not only that, you should record all your	243.42	4.5
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	winning trades as well. Write down what you think  you did right. That way, you can look back at it	247.92	4.62
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	and try to repeat the concepts you did right. When first starting out, you should not be	252.54	3.96
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	focused on the money aspect of trading at  all. You should purely be focusing on your	256.5	4.68
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	trading strategy, improving said strategy,  and trying to learn as much as possible.	261.18	4.8

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the expected value is nearly 16 trillion	6.06	4.26
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	dollars by 2030. I think that we all	8.28	4.02

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	innovation because AI is going to touch	12.3	3.6
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	every industry and it's going to cause	14.28	3.66
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	us to adjust how we create View and	15.9	4.08

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	why I'm going to discuss the top 10	19.98	3.54
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Stock that are in position to gain the	21.66	3.24
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	most from the boom of artificial	23.52	3.179
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	intelligence actually it's going to be	24.9	3.719
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	hard to narrow it down to 10 so I'm	26.699	3.061

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the different companies that I reviewed	31.56	3.48
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	in this research so you can capitalize	32.94	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	on the estimated compounding growth of	35.04	4.56
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	34 a year for the next decade for now	36.84	4.62
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	let's get started with Nvidia which	39.6	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	happens to be a manufacturer of graphics	41.46	4.56
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	cards and complex chips but they do so	43.44	4.56
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	much more a main reason that they have	46.02	4.32
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	so much to gain from AI is that we all	48.0	4.26
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	know that AI is a set of algorithms made	50.34	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	up within a package program and there	52.26	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	are a lot of software companies creating	54.18	4.019
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	these programs but in order for them to	55.98	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	grow and scale they need Hardware like	58.199	4.321
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	nvidia's gpus to be the backbone of the	60.42	4.379

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	offer generative AI models for	69.36	3.6
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Enterprise use for companies to build	71.159	3.721

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	partnering with Medtronic to create an	77.4	4.2

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Hollow scan my point is that Nvidia is	84.24	3.6
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	creating Partnerships across several	86.34	3.12
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	different Industries and those are all	87.84	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	industries that will fuel massive growth	89.46	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	over the next several years that will	91.74	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	make Nvidia a key company to invest in	93.18	5.16
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	as a comparison year to date the S P 500	95.46	6.14

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	1995 clippy but I expect that Microsoft	146.76	4.32

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	mirrors and performance so I'm simply	348.24	3.299
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	going to show the class A where the	350.1	3.539

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	in China as a comparison there's sort of	390.66	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	a mashup between Tesla and Google but	392.819	3.421
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	from the Chinese market as for their	394.56	3.78
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	performance their stock is up 5.9	396.24	4.079
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	percent year-to-date but analysts have	398.34	4.199

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	analyst predictions are just that	404.58	3.42
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	predictions now moving on to another	406.08	4.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	large company that has a massive stake	408.0	4.86
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	in Ai and that happens to be Tesla I	410.22	4.68
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	know this one is not a shock to any of	412.86	3.66
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	you and it's an obvious choice for the	414.9	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	list everyone knows how they've created	416.52	4.739
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	independent vehicles capable of near 100	418.8	4.56
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	self-driving and they've logged millions	421.259	3.841
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	of hours of test data captured from	423.36	3.66
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	every Tesla that's on the road where	425.1	3.78
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	they continue to build out the most	427.02	4.32
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	robust autonomous algorithms that tackle	428.88	5.46
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	real world situations every day and they	431.34	5.22
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	were pure genius to leverage video as	434.34	4.079
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	their main input versus radar because	436.56	4.02
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	video input is transferable to any other	438.419	4.201
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	situation in format and it's much more	440.58	3.6
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	human-like having worked in the	442.62	3.12
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	high-tech industry myself for several	444.18	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	years I think the Tesla in some ways is	445.74	4.5
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	a bit misunderstood by most of us and	448.08	4.08
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	what I mean by that is that we all see	450.24	3.959
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the shiny object of the Tesla cars that	452.16	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	are right there in front of us but in	454.199	4.081
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	some ways I see it as misdirection the	455.88	4.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	cars are literally a vehicle for	458.28	4.02
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	training Ai and everyone that buys a	460.02	4.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Tesla quickly becomes part of their	462.3	4.32
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	experiment when flying cars start to	464.16	4.379
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	become a reality who do you think will	466.62	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	be ahead of the competition because they	468.539	3.6
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	already have the roadmap for all things	470.34	4.799
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	AI situational awareness and automated	472.139	5.34
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	decision making or when robots become	475.139	4.081
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	mainstream and take on repetitious and	477.479	3.541
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	labor and intensive jobs like warehouse	479.22	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	work cleaning and cooking once again	481.02	4.079
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	who's going to have the software	483.12	4.32
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	hardware and models to easily take on	485.099	4.741
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	those situational environments on top of	487.44	4.86
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	all of that what if Tesla decided to	489.84	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	license out its autonomous driving	492.3	3.899
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	software to other manufacturers I	493.68	4.5
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	guarantee you that Elon Musk knows that	496.199	3.06
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	there's very little profit in	498.18	3.06
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	manufacturing it's all in the software	499.259	3.601
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	and they added services that he can be	501.24	3.54
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	providing long term from their AI	502.86	3.839
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	knowledge and when you add up all that	504.78	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	they have going on publicly Tesla is an	506.699	4.021
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	obvious choice to be on the top of the	509.22	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	AI stock list currently the performance	510.72	5.28
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	year to date is up 32.6 percent or most	512.94	5.88
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	analysts have this as a buy stock moving	516.0	5.279
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	right along to the next top AI stock and	518.82	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	that happens to be meta which owns	521.279	4.5
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and Oculus	523.26	4.98
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	VR meta began leaning in heavily with AI	525.779	4.441
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	with regards to its ads platform and its	528.24	3.719
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	reels that play on its social networks	530.22	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	using AI in this way has allowed meta to	531.959	4.32
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	create massive growth in their ad	534.66	3.96
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Revenue in q1 of this year and it's just	536.279	4.021
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	now starting to show under stock price	538.62	4.26
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	meta plans to continue leveraging AI for	540.3	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	its recommendations but they also want	542.88	3.12
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	to Branch out and have ai help	544.74	3.12
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	businesses with their customer and tech	546.0	3.899
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	support with the use of bots and also	547.86	4.02

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	on their platforms meta has begun to	551.88	4.2
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	make a major comeback this year with its	553.86	4.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	profits getting turned around and I	556.08	3.48
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	believe that they'll double down on AI	558.0	3.12
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	now that they have competitors they're	559.56	3.66
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	also making that push most recently	561.12	4.86
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	meta's performance was up 100.4 percent	563.22	4.799
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	year to date where analysts continue to	565.98	4.5
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	have it as a buy I'll now follow that up	568.019	4.861
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	with another small company called Arista	570.48	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	networks that is known for selling	572.88	3.36
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	computer network switches and software	574.32	3.6
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	solutions that help to speed up the	576.24	3.599
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	communications among all those racks of	577.92	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	computer servers in the data centers	579.839	4.321
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	these switches happen to be the backbone	581.64	4.379
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	system to some degree for companies like	584.16	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Microsoft and meta which happen to be	586.019	4.861
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	arista's two largest customers and with	588.06	5.399
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	both those customers on the top AI list	590.88	4.56
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	it only makes sense that Arista will	593.459	3.961
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	need to scale and grow with them this is	595.44	3.36
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	one of those companies that isn't a	597.42	3.599
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	driving force for or AI but they are a	598.8	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	necessary partner for the companies that	601.019	3.181
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	are creating the AI systems that are	602.64	3.24
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	going to require constant upgrades to	604.2	3.48
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	their infrastructure and that's where	605.88	4.019
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Arista comes into play to date their	607.68	4.02

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	and the next company for the top AI	740.16	5.28
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	stock is tsmc which is similar to Nvidia	742.32	5.22
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	in that they make semiconductors however	745.44	4.38
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the key difference is that tsmc has over	747.54	4.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	50 percent of the market share and	749.82	4.019

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	or fashion there's just no way around it	760.2	4.68
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	from a point of valuation the price to	762.42	5.159
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	earnings for tsmc is at 23x versus	764.88	6.48
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	nvidia's at 131x which makes tsmc a	767.579	5.76
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	better bet financially for stock growth	771.36	4.2
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	however with them being located in	773.339	4.201
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Taiwan there's a serious concern with	775.56	3.959
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	China's desire to overtake Taiwan by	777.54	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	force and when you look at the chart I	779.519	3.901
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	showed earlier with tsmc making up over	781.38	5.1
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	50 share of semiconductors if China took	783.42	5.34
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	over Taiwan then they could cut out all	786.48	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	of these semiconductors from all of the	788.76	3.54
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	western Nations and that's why the Us	790.38	4.139
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	and other countries are so interested in	792.3	3.96
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Taiwan being able to defend themselves	794.519	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the current performance of tsmc is up	796.26	5.04
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	9.7 percent year-to-date where their	798.959	4.44

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	an analysts have it as a consistent buy	803.399	3.601
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	rating where they see upside of around	805.32	4.74

jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	A stock is an investment that represents a share	54.763	2.794
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	or partial ownership  of a company—	57.557	3.212
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	meaning that a single  share of a stock	60.769	2.085
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	means having fractional ownership of a company	62.854	2.878
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	in proportion to the total number of shares.	65.732	3.42
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	From the company  side of things,	69.152	1.293
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	stocks are a way to give a company capital.	70.445	2.669
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	So, you probably want to know how this affects you,	73.114	2.795
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and how to make money.	75.909	1.626

jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	but first, cue the history lesson.	78.787	2.419
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	The first modern  stock trading	84.292	1.752
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	was created in Amsterdam,	86.044	1.626
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	when the  Dutch East India Company	87.67	1.669
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	became the first publicly traded company in 1602.	89.339	4.254
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	The Dutch East India Company was established	93.593	2.127
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	to take advantage of  trade opportunities	95.72	2.002
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	in the East Indies.	97.722	1.752
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	But, they had a problem:	99.474	1.627
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	They needed a lot of money, and they didn't have it.	101.101	3.003
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	In order to raise money  for their voyages,	104.104	2.335
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	they decided to sell stock  in the company	106.439	2.252
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	to anyone in Amsterdam who was willing to invest.	108.691	3.295
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	In return, investors	111.986	1.168
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	got a fractional ownership  in the company,	113.154	1.877
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and a distribution of profits	115.031	1.46
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	if the company itself  turned a profit.	116.491	2.711
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	But, what do stocks  look like today?	119.202	2.044
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	Hello, Callie, thank you  so much	122.914	1.627
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	for joining me here today.	124.541	1.293
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- Hey! Thanks for having me.	125.834	2.377
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- So, since you're the expert,	128.211	2.21
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	on a very basic level,	130.421	1.293
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	because I know nothing,  what are stocks?	131.714	3.337
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- A stock is ownership  in a company	135.051	1.585
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	that can be publicly or privately traded.	136.636	2.169
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	Public companies can be traded on an exchange—	138.805	3.337
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	I'm talking about the  New York Stock Exchange,	142.142	2.21
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	I'm talking about  the NASDAQ—	144.352	1.502
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	are two that  most people know.	145.854	1.543
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	On the other hand,  sports teams like NFL teams,	147.397	2.669
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	for example, are  private enterprises	150.066	2.628
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	meaning that shareholders own them,	152.694	1.835
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	but you can't trade them on the stock market.	154.529	1.752
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- So on an individual level,	156.281	2.919
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	would you say that stocks  are a great way	159.2	1.669
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	to generate personal wealth?	160.869	1.876
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- So, first of all, nothing guarantees wealth.	162.745	3.129
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	That being said, history  over decades	165.874	2.711
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	has shown that investing in the stock market	168.585	2.919
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and holding  a diversified portfolio,	171.504	2.252
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	or a portfolio of a bunch of different kinds of stocks,	173.756	3.087
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	can be a compelling way  to build wealth.	176.843	2.377
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- What is the main reason that the stock market	179.22	2.169
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	has been such  a wealth generator?	181.389	2.628
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- You end up making money through something	184.017	2.377
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	that we call  'capital appreciation,'	186.394	1.71
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	which is basically  where the company	188.104	1.71
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	becomes more and more valuable over time.	189.814	2.211
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	If you have $100, and you buy a stock that's $10 a share,	192.025	3.378
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	then you're hoping  if that share	195.403	2.544
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	moves up to $20 over time,	197.947	2.044
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and you sell it at $20, then you essentially have $200.	199.991	4.129
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	It can work both ways too:	204.12	1.585
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	You could buy 10 shares  of a $10 stock,	205.705	2.628
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and that stock's share price could go to zero as well,	208.333	2.836
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and you could  lose all your money.	211.169	1.168
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	So there isn't a certainty, there isn't a guarantee	212.337	3.169
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	that you're going  to make money	215.506	1.877
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	off of stocks or  in the market—	217.383	2.253
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and that's the risk you take for that hopeful return.	219.636	2.419
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- All right, so can you tell me  what the difference is	222.055	3.211
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	between an individual stock versus a mutual fund?	225.266	4.004
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- Single stocks are what most people think of as investing:	229.27	4.129
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	it's buying a share of Apple.	233.399	1.877
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	By comparison, ETFs and mutual funds allow you	235.276	3.462
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	to invest in a basket  of companies.	238.738	2.085
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	An ETF trades  on an exchange,	240.823	3.295
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	it's like Apple for example.	244.118	1.669
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	It's just like a stock; you can see its prices	245.787	2.127
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	during the day change  by the second.	247.914	2.294
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	A mutual fund, however, doesn't necessarily trade.	250.208	4.087
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	They are actively  managed funds	254.295	2.503
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	that allow you to invest in a basket of companies,	256.798	3.837
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and many investors  choose them	260.635	1.627
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	because it is the easier way to get broad-based exposure	262.262	4.212
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	to certain markets  in certain sectors.	266.474	2.461
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- If I wanted to start  buying stocks	268.935	2.085
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and investing in companies,	271.02	1.21
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	what should I know  before I begin?	272.23	2.169
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- The big thing you need to do when you start investing	274.399	2.168
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	is to sit down  and ask yourself,	276.567	2.461
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	"Why do I wanna invest?"	279.028	1.293
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	Because when you're investing in the stock market	280.321	2.169
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	you are taking on some risk— nobody has a crystal ball.	282.49	3.295
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	And the concept  of diversification	285.785	2.169
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and asset allocation	287.954	1.043
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	really stems from all of that.	288.997	1.668
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	So 'diversification'  is basically the act	290.665	3.045
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	of putting your money  in different assets,	293.71	2.752
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	in different sectors,  in different stocks	296.462	1.836
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	because you ultimately can't tell the future.	298.298	3.086
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	And as much as you like  a certain stock	301.384	2.377
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	or a certain sector,	303.761	1.085
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	you want to hedge your bets by spreading your money out.	304.846	3.253
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	And then you need to track it;	308.099	1.21
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	you need to watch it  as markets move,	309.309	2.502
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and make sure it doesn't stray	311.811	1.835
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	too far away  from your targets.	313.646	1.627
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	Of course, you can lose that money that you invest,	315.273	2.961
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	but sometimes the best way to learn is by doing.	318.234	3.128
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	And I usually tell people to, you know,	321.362	2.67
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	"A: Read about it."	324.032	1.418
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	You know, start looking into the stock market,	325.45	2.002
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	how it works,  how investing works.	327.452	2.335
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	Even if you haven't  started investing,	329.787	1.627
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	that's a great way to become comfortable with it.	331.414	2.002
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- How do young people	333.416	2.044
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	who don't have a lot of extra money to invest	335.46	2.878
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	get started in buying a stock?	338.338	2.794
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- If you come to a brokerage and you have $10 or $20,	341.132	2.628
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	chances are you can find a way to invest that.	343.76	2.46
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- Oh really, only $10, $20?	346.22	1.46
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- There are no minimums,	347.68	1.293
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and a lot of brokerages also don't charge fees for trading.	348.973	3.253
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- Wow, okay.	352.226	1.168
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- Even if it is just $15 or $20, staying engaged	353.394	3.128
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	can lead to, you know, a nice portfolio value over time—	356.522	5.047
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	if you give it time, and if you're willing to be patient.	361.569	2.461
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	The real power  of investing happens	364.03	2.294
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	when you invest over time on a regular schedule,	366.324	2.794
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and you increase  the amount of money	369.118	2.169
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	you invest as you can.	371.287	1.335
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	- Thank you so much, Callie,	372.622	1.46
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	this has been a great interview, and very informing.	374.082	2.836
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	I really enjoyed speaking to the stocks expert,	378.669	2.42
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and learning the value of investing early on.	381.089	2.711
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	The stock market always felt	383.8	1.668
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	really intimidating  to me, personally,	385.468	1.877
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and investing was reserved for my more mature friends	387.345	2.753
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	who enjoyed staring at their computer screens all day.	390.098	2.961
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	Now I realize that  anybody can do it,	393.059	2.085
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	especially with the help  of professionals.	395.144	2.086
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	While it will always be a risky game to play,	397.23	2.294
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	investing can ultimately make a huge difference	399.524	2.502
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	in one's finances—	402.026	1.085
jlez7mE-vtI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlez7mE-vtI	and you can start  with any amount.	403.111	2.46

fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	of parallels with upsc exam preparation	4.319	4.74
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	you would have had friends relatives who	6.66	4.559
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	would have prepared for upsc exam they	9.059	3.601

fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	point why it is critical I'll repeat why	144.239	5.701
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	it is critical to book profits so to	147.36	4.62
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	explain that point let me do a macro	149.94	4.32
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	analysis from a long term perspective of	151.98	4.619
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	nifty 50. so for newcomers who are just	154.26	3.78
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	kind of getting started with Stock	156.599	3.541
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	Investing nifty fifty means collection	158.04	4.74
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	of top 50 stocks in India it represents	160.14	5.099

fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	indicates the health of the stock market	167.58	4.56
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	so if you consider a macro perspective a	169.08	5.1
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	fairly long-term perspective for nifty	172.14	4.8
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	50 let me show you three phases phase	174.18	5.52
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	one is from the year 2008 almost	176.94	6.42
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	February to the year 2014 May so almost	179.7	6.06
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	Chase all six years how much returns	183.36	4.68
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	would be Nifty give Nifty gave zero	185.76	4.199
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	percent return now why am I saying zero	188.04	4.08
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	percent return for example if you would	189.959	4.86
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	have invested 1 lakh rupee in nifty 50	192.12	6.119
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	in 2008 on this particular date and if	194.819	5.041
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	you would have done nothing after that	198.239	3.42
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	the market would have danced around went	199.86	4.08
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	back low high low high so on and so	201.659	4.261
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	forth and finally you recover that	203.94	4.26
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	investment back to one lakh rupee in	205.92	5.399
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	2014. so again understanding that profit	208.2	5.16
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	booking is important is critical now	211.319	3.42
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	I'll say that you are showing just an	213.36	3.48
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	exceptional phase not at all let me take	214.739	3.901
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	you to phase two so this phase starts	216.84	4.92
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	from 2015 from almost February of 2015	218.64	6.3
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	and it lasted 2020. that one lakh rupee	221.76	5.88
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	in a western nifty 50 in 2015 hold it	224.94	5.46
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	till 2020 zero percent again okay so	227.64	4.5
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	that is phase two that almost four or	230.4	3.419
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	five years again gone no returns	232.14	3.42
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	something similar is happening now that	233.819	3.301
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	for example this is phase three this	235.56	5.34
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	started in October of 2021 and right now	237.12	6.78
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	we are in May of 2023 so how many months	240.9	4.8
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	I will write it down so that you can	243.9	3.899
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	understand the gravity of it so 20	245.7	4.08
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	months have happened and how much	247.799	3.36
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	returns have we made zero percent	249.78	4.56
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	returns we have made those Cameo here	251.159	4.92
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	right I mean this is like a scam what's	254.34	3.06
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	the point of investing in the stock	256.079	2.641
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	market there is no return that is	257.4	2.7
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	happening you have shown us like three	258.72	2.54
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	phases	260.1	3.36
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	and there are like zero percent return	261.26	4.12
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	that we are making what's the point of	263.46	4.08
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	even investing okay so here is the point	265.38	3.96
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	and here is a trick that you need to	267.54	3.78
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	understand and this is a concept that	269.34	3.96
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	very few people will explain it to you	271.32	4.2
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	so consider liking this video in case	273.3	3.899
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	you like this tip so see let's work	275.52	3.42
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	through all the three phases and I will	277.199	3.361
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	tell you the profit making opportunity	278.94	3.84
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	here so what you would notice is the	280.56	4.079
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	range so you need to consider the range	282.78	4.02
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	also we have considered the timeline	284.639	3.721
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this is the entire timeline that almost	286.8	3.36
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	six years gone right and zero percent	288.36	4.14
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	return but also consider the range in	290.16	3.84
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	which Nifty traded so what is the	292.5	3.24
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	meaning of range so range means the	294.0	3.6
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	bottom most point and the highest point	295.74	4.32
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	in this zone so that range comes out to	297.6	6.06
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	be roughly 150 percent so yes in six	300.06	5.76
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	years Nifty eight zero returns but the	303.66	5.52
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	range was 150 so you would have made 145	305.82	5.099
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	return if you would have bought	309.18	4.079
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	everything at the bottom and sold	310.919	4.741
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	everything at the top now you'll say	313.259	4.44
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	that okay this does not happen you can't	315.66	3.78
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	time the market bottom line You can	317.699	3.841
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	predict top you cannot predict 100 agree	319.44	4.199
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	you can't do it but see we are not	321.54	4.439
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	trying to make 145 gain what I'm simply	323.639	3.9
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	trying to tell you is let's see the	325.979	4.081
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	range was 145 but could you have	327.539	5.1
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	probably captured like 30 gain my bet is	330.06	4.919
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	yes if you understand this price range	332.639	4.681
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	movement okay so this is Phase One let	334.979	4.141
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	me do this quick analysis for phase two	337.32	3.3
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	and phase three also and then I will	339.12	3.54
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	tell you strategy as to how you can	340.62	3.78
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	capture this range okay so the same	342.66	3.78
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	analysis for this phase two that I was	344.4	3.78
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	speaking that almost four or five years	346.44	4.62
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	gone from 2015 all the way to 2020 zero	348.18	4.739
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	percent gains but what was the range	351.06	3.479
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	movement right so rain will start from	352.919	3.661
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	somewhere here all the way till here so	354.539	5.041
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	almost 78 potential profits to be	356.58	4.92
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	captured what about this phase three	359.58	3.839
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	that what is the range in this phase	361.5	3.96
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	three so again you will see that the	363.419	3.481
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	half a that range comes out to be	365.46	4.98
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	roughly 20 so 18 to 20 is what we could	366.9	5.16
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	have potentially captured in this phase	370.44	4.62
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	three now if you analyze phase one the	372.06	5.699
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	potential upside was 146 range phase two	375.06	5.639
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	what was 17 80 percent here phase three	377.759	6.421
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	now if you just eyeball it 18 to 20 so	380.699	6.0
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	it means let's see this Nifty movement	384.18	4.92
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	can go in two ways so one way is that it	386.699	3.72
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	dances around like this it goes	389.1	2.879
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	something like up right and a bigger	390.419	3.361
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	range is created so you can potentially	391.979	4.44
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	capture that that's the first way it	393.78	5.4
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	could move second is right I mean it	396.419	4.5
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	just simply goes out so both these	399.18	4.38
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	scenarios if you know how to handle you	400.919	4.381
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	are going to make a lot of money in the	403.56	3.6
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	space three and that is what is the	405.3	3.42
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	meaning of bull market bull market does	407.16	2.64
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	not mean that you know what you see	408.72	2.58
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	there the stock market is going to go up	409.8	3.48
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	like this and whatever you are investing	411.3	4.14
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	now you can easily book profit Market	413.28	3.78
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	will not give you that opportunity it	415.44	3.18
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	will always scare you whenever you are	417.06	3.9
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	booking profits not booking profits you	418.62	3.72
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	will always feel that little bit	420.96	3.239
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	queasiness right so that is going to	422.34	4.02
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	happen so therefore you must understand	424.199	5.101
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	how to intelligently time the market now	426.36	4.92
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	before moving on to the timing part of	429.3	3.72
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	it and showing you the strategy	431.28	4.199
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	let me also address the entire concept	433.02	4.619
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	of timing the market because there is	435.479	4.321
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this incorrect notion that Mr Warren	437.639	3.721
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	Buffett said that you should never time	439.8	2.64
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	the market	441.36	2.88
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	okay I'm not trying to criticize Mr	442.44	4.08
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	Warren Buffett Mr Warren Buffett would	444.24	4.14
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	have said that statement in some other	446.52	4.079
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	context people picked it in some other	448.38	4.439
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	context how can I prove it to you by	450.599	4.021
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	showing you exactly what Mr Warren	452.819	4.201
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	Buffett is doing so here is the data of	454.62	4.139
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	Berkshire Hathaway the company that he	457.02	3.6
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	runs and let me show you the cash	458.759	4.261
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	positions of Berkshire Hathaway in the	460.62	4.56
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	last five years what you will notice is	463.02	6.0
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	that back in the last quarter of 2021 he	465.18	6.06
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	was sitting on 88 billion dollars of	469.02	4.98
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	cash right now he is sitting on 26	471.24	4.56
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	billion dollars of cash and this is one	474.0	3.66
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	of the lowest amounts he is sitting on	475.8	4.32
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	any cash in the last four or five years	477.66	4.319
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	and you can see this right from all this	480.12	4.079
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	chart so even he's trying to time the	481.979	3.66
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	market right I mean otherwise he would	484.199	3.9
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	have always stayed investors I'll just	485.639	4.201
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	keep on doing sib is he doing it the	488.099	3.361
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	short answer is no he's moving around	489.84	3.6
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	his cash investing more when it makes	491.46	4.799
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	sense booking profits when he feels that	493.44	4.92
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	the market is overvalued now that is	496.259	4.081
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	something that you should also do so	498.36	3.779
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	comes the natural question that okay can	500.34	3.96
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	you comment a little bit what strategy	502.139	3.78
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	you are talking about hundred percent	504.3	3.42
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	yes now I will be teaching more	505.919	3.661
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	strategies on my paid member community	507.72	4.379
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	and on my courses I do that there is a	509.58	4.139
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	special class this Sunday on discussion	512.099	3.601
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	module where I will discuss all the	513.719	3.901
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	profit booking strategies but one	515.7	3.839
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	strategy I'm explaining it to you on	517.62	4.26
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this video so let me talk about it and	519.539	4.38
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this is the channel trading strategy see	521.88	4.019
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	in a channel trading strategy you have a	523.919	4.021
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	very clear idea what the technical	525.899	4.081
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	pattern looks like right and a channel	527.94	3.78
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	is getting formed or is it not getting	529.98	3.6
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	formed so let me show it to you right so	531.72	4.14
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	for example if you draw a channel here	533.58	4.439
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this is very clear that this is a	535.86	4.2
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	downtrend right so if you are trading	538.019	3.961
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this channel for example you buy it here	540.06	4.62
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	right and you sell it here then it makes	541.98	4.68
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	sense and this pattern somewhat got	544.68	3.96
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	followed right so this was a specific	546.66	4.56
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	channel that got formed so this is our	548.64	4.02
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	Channel now there are three types of	551.22	3.179
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	channels that can be formed so this is a	552.66	3.9
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	down Channel this is a sideways Channel	554.399	4.681
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	and this is an upward moving channel so	556.56	4.68
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	if you find such a thing playing out for	559.08	3.6
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	a specific stock especially specific	561.24	3.719
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	index then you could consider running	562.68	4.26
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this channel trading strategy now is	564.959	3.541
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	some Channel getting formed right now on	566.94	3.72
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	nifty50 so the short answer is yes and	568.5	4.019
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	let me draw it out to you so it would	570.66	3.54
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	look something like this so if you are	572.519	3.481
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	trading on nifty 50 all you have to do	574.2	4.98
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	is that sell here and Buy Here Sell Here	576.0	5.7
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	and buy here so this is what you need to	579.18	4.02
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	do because this channel is getting	581.7	2.94
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	formed now some of you would say that	583.2	2.819
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	can you take guarantee that this will	584.64	3.3
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	100 work see guys there is no guarantee	586.019	3.601
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	there is probability you have to go by	587.94	3.36
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	mathematics what is likely to happen	589.62	3.96
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	right now there is no macro indicator	591.3	4.2
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	that something bad is likely to happen	593.58	4.439
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	interest rates have Peak inflation is	595.5	4.86
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	under control so therefore macros tell	598.019	4.561
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	us that we are net investor as of now	600.36	3.84
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	there is a good chance that the market	602.58	3.48
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	is going to give a run up now I can't	604.2	3.6
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	write it on a stamp paper and give it to	606.06	3.54
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	you that okay Market is going to move I	607.8	3.599
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	can't do it no one can do it so anyways	609.6	3.179
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this is called as Channel trading	611.399	3.541
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	strategy now see the problem is that	612.779	3.721
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	people just understand half of the	614.94	3.18
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	equation that I told you this channel	616.5	3.72
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	trading strategy yeah now I'm going to	618.12	4.62
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	do this only no you have to apply a	620.22	4.26
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	little bit of brain little bit of logic	622.74	4.44
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	and pick the right type of stocks where	624.48	4.68
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this should be run so how do we pick	627.18	3.779
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	right type of stocks okay so let us	629.16	3.9
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	understand by going to a little bit of	630.959	4.741
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	Basics here how this can be done so I	633.06	4.44
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	told you and this is phase three what we	635.7	4.319
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	are analyzing here so market right now	637.5	6.779
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	is at 18 600 and here again 20 months	640.019	8.161
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	ago Market was at 18 600. now tell me	644.279	6.3
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this that if you check the performance	648.18	5.7
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	of individual stocks here in this part	650.579	6.661
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	one and individual stocks here in this	653.88	6.24
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	part two do you think everything is at	657.24	4.62
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	the same level hypothetically speaking	660.12	3.899
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	just to help you understand this let's	661.86	4.44
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	say that Reliance was at 2000 rupee I'm	664.019	4.56
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	just making up the number is it still at	666.3	5.279
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	rupees 2000 here right for example TCS	668.579	6.601
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	if it was at a 3000 rupee here is it	671.579	5.88
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	still at a 3000 rupee here right so you	675.18	4.32
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	need to use little bit of brain here in	677.459	4.32
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	order to identify discounted stocks so	679.5	4.62

fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	next decade so which means 10 years it	792.42	3.84
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	will go 4X so this is a fairly high	794.399	4.261
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	growth rate this prediction was done in	796.26	5.879
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	2019 and what was the size of the major	798.66	5.7
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	fund industry then in India it was 25	802.139	5.401
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	lakh crore now we are in 2023 covet	804.36	4.5
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	situation has happened bunch of other	807.54	3.0
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	different problems have happened what is	808.86	3.479

fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	crore so yes this prediction might fall	815.279	5.101
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	short by 10 20 but still it will be a	817.86	4.68
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	fairly large amount it is given that the	820.38	4.199
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	mutual fund industry in India is going	822.54	3.72

fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	which is what AUM indicates AUM	826.26	4.5
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	indicates the total size or the total	828.54	4.08
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	money which is being managed by mutual	830.76	3.6
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	fund now the more money that they manage	832.62	3.54
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	more is the profits that they will be	834.36	4.08
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	making one way or the other that is a	836.16	4.08
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	simple Point yes commissions can be cut	838.44	3.3
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this that bunch of other different	840.24	3.48
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	things can happen but if they are	841.74	3.599
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	managing almost like four extra money	843.72	4.14
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	they are going to do well now see this	845.339	5.461
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	entire commentary in context of HDFC EMC	847.86	5.099
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	stock as of now now what is the price of	850.8	4.14
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	the stock as of today so it is roughly	852.959	5.94
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	at 1978. when did this price exist this	854.94	6.899
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	price had existed back in 2018. so five	858.899	5.641
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	years zero percent return on HDFC EMC	861.839	4.521
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	stock	864.54	5.16
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	maybe it is not able to manage its	866.36	5.58
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	profits revenues you know sales	869.7	4.8
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	so let's quickly take a look at the	871.94	4.48
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	fundamentals also very very quickly so	874.5	3.779
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	here is the airwise sales for the	876.42	3.779
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	company right now it is sitting at	878.279	3.901
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	highest ever profit highest ever sales	880.199	4.08
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	right so both are fine does it have	882.18	3.719
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	massive amount of debt the short answer	884.279	4.081
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	is no it is not at what price is it	885.899	4.321
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	available it is available at five year	888.36	4.08
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	old price in an industry that is growing	890.22	4.08
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	like crazy then why do you think that	892.44	4.8
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	HDFC AMC is not going to achieve its	894.3	4.62
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	previous high and if it goes to its	897.24	3.24
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	previous high you're almost going to	898.92	4.5
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	make 100 money on a fairly stable stocks	900.48	4.38
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	producing now you will say that okay no	903.42	3.24
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this is not a stable stock it fell by a	904.86	3.539
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	lot see anything can happen I'm not	906.66	3.84
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	saying that HDFC EMC cannot fall this is	908.399	4.201
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	a risk that we take and sometimes our	910.5	4.079
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	bet can go wrong but whatever bet you	912.6	3.78
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	are taking it should be taken sensibly	914.579	3.841
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	so this becomes a great candidate for	916.38	4.019
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	doing Channel trading so how will you do	918.42	3.96
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	Channel trading on it so okay so if you	920.399	4.201
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	actually understand the support and	922.38	4.8
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	resistance line this is a very important	924.6	5.4
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	resistance line as of now and this is a	927.18	4.38
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	very important support line so this	930.0	3.36
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	becomes a channel right so there is a	931.56	3.36
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	very good likelihood that the stock	933.36	3.599
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	might move in this Channel and then if	934.92	3.359
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	good news comes or something good	936.959	2.761
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	happens with the stock from a news	938.279	3.36
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	perspective and suddenly people start	939.72	3.72
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	trusting the stock more then it will	941.639	3.781
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	move to this channel right so then you	943.44	3.839
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	can trade possibly this channel also	945.42	4.32
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	right now it is at the low end of this	947.279	4.261
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	particular channel so this is where I	949.74	3.48
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	will be building some of my more	951.54	4.14
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	positions on HDFC from that perspective	953.22	4.859
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	and will treat this now this is not	955.68	4.14
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	being seen in isolation because the	958.079	3.841
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	entire EMC industry is going to get	959.82	4.56
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	pushed what other stocks will benefit	961.92	4.62
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	from it for example take a look at cams	964.38	3.899
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	now something very similar is happening	966.54	4.14
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	with cams also now this again is a very	968.279	4.981
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	important resistance line and this is a	970.68	4.74
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	very important support line right and it	973.26	4.259
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	is just started to enter this channel	975.42	5.099
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	here so what can you do so if you are	977.519	4.62
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	buying it here you will literally trade	980.519	3.721
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this channel If It Moves In the Zone now	982.139	4.981
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	this is again a good 15 20 range to be	984.24	5.159
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	captured and that is how by trading the	987.12	4.44
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	channel intelligently you can make a lot	989.399	3.961
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	of money now this is just one technique	991.56	3.66
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	there are multiple techniques that you	993.36	3.839
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	need to keep in mind and again go back	995.22	3.419
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	to those three phases that I was	997.199	3.241
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	explaining that people who just keep on	998.639	4.921
fOPAxm21z5A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPAxm21z5A	doing blindly sipk are my name is going	1000.44	4.8

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and foremost quickly understand what is	149.76	3.54
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the meaning of index so index in very	151.379	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	simple term means that it is a unit of	153.3	4.14
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	measure so to say for example if you	155.34	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	have to figure out that how much germi	157.44	3.06
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	it is then what are you going to check	159.06	2.759

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	right so in India we measure temperature	163.319	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	as per celsius if it is 45 degree	165.06	4.319
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	temperature like something in Delhi NCR	167.28	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	then it is fairly hot if it is like	169.379	3.901
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	minus one degree something like Shimla	171.48	3.3
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	or Manali then it is fairly cool	173.28	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	similarly in the stock market also we	174.78	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	have these reference point called as	177.0	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	indices now in India there are various	178.5	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	types of indices for example one of the	180.78	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	most popular index is called as nifty 50	183.0	4.98
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	now now this is the collection of top 50	185.34	4.979
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies by market weight so you will	187.98	4.44
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	have companies like HDFC Bank company	190.319	5.401

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	part of the top 50 stocks in India and	195.72	5.28
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	if you go and make a briefcase of these	198.599	5.161
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies then it is called as Nifty 50.	201.0	5.159
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	similarly another popular index On The	203.76	5.22
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Rise is called as Nifty next 50. so this	206.159	4.86
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	comprises of companies which are ranked	208.98	4.619
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	from 51 to almost 100 and this becomes	211.019	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	another type of index then you have	213.599	3.541
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	something called as Nifty bank for	215.519	3.0
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example this would have companies like	217.14	3.239
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	SBI it would be given a certain weight	218.519	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you will have HDFC Bank you will have	220.379	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	kotek Mahindra bank so all these Banks	222.299	3.901
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	if you go and create a briefcase it	224.22	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	becomes an index same goes for Nifty it	226.2	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and there have been a bunch of	228.48	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	categorizations that have been done so	230.28	3.959
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to cut the long story short in India we	232.08	4.2

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	comes the second natural question that	241.68	3.54
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	okay why is it that index investing is	243.18	4.38

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	there any specific advantage to index	247.56	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investing now I don't want to make this	249.239	3.601

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Bank all these are good good companies	311.759	3.981
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and worst case scenarios	313.56	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	I'm not taking exposure to small cap	315.74	4.06

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	very low and number three if I take a	330.84	4.139
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	look at the 20-year historic tagger of	332.759	4.081

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	invested now let me go and take a little	352.74	4.019
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	bit of risk but these still remain the	354.479	4.861
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	top 100 companies in India so to say so	356.759	4.261
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	maybe investing my money here is	359.34	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	sensible now third you will think of it	361.02	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	in a similar way that okay Bank Nifty	363.36	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	may find taking exposure then probably I	365.22	4.319
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	am getting exposure in the best banks in	367.56	4.199
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	India so that is the philosophy with	369.539	4.321
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	which people invest in Index this is	371.759	3.421
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	something that no one is going to	373.86	3.3
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	explain it to you but I hope that you	375.18	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	understood this subtle point because	377.16	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	this is where the story gets shaped up	378.66	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	so let's move over to the story with	380.52	4.019
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	adanis as to what is happening and why	382.38	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is so much who Allah is happening in the	384.539	4.021
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	market because adani stocks are getting	386.46	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	imbibed into this index so in regards to	388.56	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the adani stock what has happened is	390.96	4.38
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that NSE has decided to include several	392.52	5.1
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of the adani stocks to several new	395.34	5.04
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	indices and old indices so approximately	397.62	5.639
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	14 indices have been defined where adani	400.38	5.159
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	stocks will find certain weight this	403.259	4.38
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	includes nifty 50 this includes Nifty	405.539	4.681
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and x50 this includes Nifty top 100 so I	407.639	3.721
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	will take you through the list in a	410.22	3.0
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	minute but let me quickly explain this	411.36	3.24
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	entire piece without making it	413.22	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	controversial so basically what happens	414.6	5.219
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is that NSE does a semi-annual review of	416.58	5.339
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the entire indices that are present in	419.819	4.681
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	India they Define and develop a certain	421.919	4.321
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	methodology they will say that for	424.5	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example nifty 50 if I have to define a	426.24	4.98
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	certain company then the criteria of	428.58	5.04
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	defining it could be market cap plus	431.22	4.199
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	there will be criteria two that needs to	433.62	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	be met third criteria should be	435.419	3.661
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	something something so whichever company	437.1	4.379
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	meets this list it ends up becoming a	439.08	4.98
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	part of nifty 50. so till here the story	441.479	4.62
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is fine that okay automatically they are	444.06	4.16
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	creating some methodology	446.099	4.861
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that becomes a relevant company for that	448.22	4.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	particular index but the problem is that	450.96	4.079
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	new indices can also be built for	453.0	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example most of us would not have heard	455.039	3.481
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of an index in India it is called as	456.78	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Nifty Sharia 25 so have you heard of it	458.52	4.14
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	honestly tell me and take a look at the	460.8	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	methodology of developing that index so	462.66	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	these type of methodologies can be used	464.88	4.379
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and new indices can be built and a lot	466.62	4.799
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of companies can find their place in	469.259	3.901
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	these type of new indices now to	471.419	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	understand part two of the problem you	473.16	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	need to understand how active investing	475.139	4.201
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Works versus passive investing and to	477.06	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	help you wrap your brain around it let	479.34	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	me use some practical examples from this	481.08	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	list so here is a list of mutual funds	482.94	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that have exposure to adani group stocks	484.86	3.899
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	for example you will see some of the	487.02	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	mutual funds as Edelweiss Arbitrage fund	488.759	5.22
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	regular growth and if you go and compare	491.52	4.86
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	it with something like Nippon India ETF	493.979	4.981
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Nifty 50bs now you might say that you	496.38	4.319
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	know what this fund one and this fund	498.96	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	two both have exposure to adani stocks	500.699	4.141
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and the fund manager is making an	502.8	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	arbitrary decision in terms of investing	504.84	4.859
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	in that no so a bunch of mutual funds	507.36	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	work very very differently for example	509.699	5.28
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Edelweiss Arbitrage fund is actually an	511.86	5.52
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	actively managed mutual fund so actively	514.979	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	manage simply means when the fund	517.38	3.42
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	manager let's say that you pay them 1000	518.94	4.019
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	rupees they will take that money and	520.8	4.38
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	then they will make a choice whether to	522.959	4.261
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	invest in adani stocks and bunch of	525.18	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	other stocks or not so they get a choice	527.22	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that whether they should be investing in	529.92	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	avani stocks or not on the flip side	531.48	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	when it comes to these nifty 50 type of	533.88	4.86
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	funds then here the fund manager does	536.16	4.799
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	not get that choice of investing in	538.74	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	adani group of companies it is	540.959	3.601
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	automatically designed that way why	542.82	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	because here you are giving the fund	544.56	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	manager and telling him that you know	546.6	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what here is my 1000 rupee take it and	548.22	4.92
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	go and invest in nifty 50 companies now	550.44	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	if adani group makes a part of that	553.14	4.139
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	nifty 50 companies then automatically	555.18	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	your money gets invested into adani	557.279	3.781
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	group so just to recap this major	559.38	3.42
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	problem what exactly is happening is	561.06	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	let's see NSC has built a bunch of	562.8	5.76
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	indices and many of the novice investors	565.08	5.28
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	are what they are thinking that okay not	568.56	3.24
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	if I go and pick something like let's	570.36	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	say nifty 50 or if I go and pick Nifty	571.8	5.099
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	next 50 but unfortunately what ends up	574.62	3.839
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	happening is that your money gets	576.899	3.421
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	passively invested into certain	578.459	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies where you might not want to	580.32	4.139
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	build any positions so this becomes a	582.42	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	slight issue now you might give me a	584.459	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	counter argument that okay NSC BSC might	586.14	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	be aware of it CB might be aware of it	588.3	3.659
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	they might be doing something to	590.16	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	counteract this situation well	591.959	3.901
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	unfortunately the way the adani story	593.76	4.44
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	has played out it is not as if that NSE	595.86	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	BSE CV are not cognizant of it but	598.2	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	actually what has happened is that this	600.6	3.54
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	methodology of building new indices and	601.98	4.44
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	giving adani companies weight into these	604.14	4.379
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	different indices this evaluation was	606.42	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	done as per last month's data but this	608.519	3.721
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	month unfortunately adani stocks have	610.5	5.16
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	fallen by 70 70 80 also so therefore	612.24	6.12
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	people are building pressure on Sab NSC	615.66	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	BSE that you know what you should	618.36	3.479
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	probably re-look into this entire	619.62	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	redefinition of these different index	621.839	4.141
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	funds now whether they will act whether	624.18	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	they will not act this remains to be	625.98	3.539
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	seen but we need to be cognizant about	627.54	4.14
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	all the problems that this new situation	629.519	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	might present now the second key problem	631.68	3.839
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is that some index funds can become	633.36	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	really really bad and you need to	635.519	3.361
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	actually put your brain behind it and	637.2	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	understand how every Index Fund is	638.88	4.139
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	functioning and many of the beginners do	640.92	3.659
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	not understand this point so let me	643.019	3.421
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	outline it by using two examples here	644.579	5.221
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	for example consider Nifty 50. now let's	646.44	5.76
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	imagine that adani Enterprise is a part	649.8	5.039
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of nifty 50. now if adani Enterprise	652.2	5.34
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Falls in market cap or market value then	654.839	5.041
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	by next evaluation this company will go	657.54	4.739
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	out of nifty fifty and some new company	659.88	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	which has more market cap or Market	662.279	4.981
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	weight will find entry into Nifty 50. so	664.14	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	I hope this point is clear about the	667.26	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Nuance associated with the Nifty 50. so	668.88	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	nifty 50 is somewhat of a decent filter	671.1	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	but on the flip side consider for	673.44	4.8
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example Nifty next 50. now here what is	675.42	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	happening is that the company is ranked	678.24	4.86
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	between 51 to 100. now imagine if three	680.16	5.52
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies are there in nifty 50 right	683.1	5.34
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	nifty 50 they fall right and they are	685.68	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	falling they are getting crushed where	688.44	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	will they find place that some company	690.18	4.86
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is let's say at rank number 31 35 and 45	691.8	5.64
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	now they might all fall because market	695.04	4.739
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	cap is falling and they will take entry	697.44	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	into this particular index now here what	699.779	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	are you theoretically doing you are	702.18	3.3
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	actually trying to catch a falling knife	703.74	3.539
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you might have heard of this phrase in	705.48	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the stock market that don't try to catch	707.279	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	a falling knife but exactly by investing	709.5	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	in this type of an index what are you	711.959	3.601
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	precisely doing you are trying to catch	714.0	3.18
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	a Walling knife so this is what is	715.56	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	automatically happening without even you	717.18	3.659
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	realizing it now I can't take you	719.22	3.42
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	through the basics of all the index	720.839	3.721
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	funds that are out there but I have	722.64	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	drawn a charge here and you can save it	724.56	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and probably research more about it	726.54	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	where is it that adani stocks are going	728.16	4.619
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to find more value for example adani	730.38	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Wilmer is a part of nifty next 50 and	732.779	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Nifty hundred adani total gas is a part	734.94	5.339
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of nifty Sharia 25 adani power is a part	737.459	5.221
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of 10 different indices adani Enterprise	740.279	5.521
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is also a part of nifty hundred liquid	742.68	5.76
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	15 and you can read all these basic	745.8	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	basic points and it will actually make	748.44	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you a little bit worried when it comes	750.54	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to index investing and rightly so now	752.1	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the third final problem in terms of bad	754.32	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies finding place in indices is	756.36	4.979
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that it leads to index management now	758.64	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what is the meaning of index management	761.339	3.601
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to explain that let me take you to nifty	762.54	4.62
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	50 chart so here you can see the last	764.94	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	one year performance of nifty 50 and	767.16	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what you would notice is that it goes up	769.26	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	it goes down it goes up it goes down it	770.76	4.379
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	goes up it goes down it is going up and	772.98	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	down in a certain cycle so to say now	775.139	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what you might have noticed is that you	777.72	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	know what banks are generally going down	779.399	4.141
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	even big Banks almost all major sectors	781.38	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	are going down but Nifty tikawa so that	783.54	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	simply means that there is something	786.06	3.0
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	called as index management that is	787.2	3.12
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	happening the meaning of index	789.06	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	management is that index will dance in a	790.32	4.62
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	certain range now why is this such an	792.72	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	important point because imagine this	794.94	3.899
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that if for example adani stocks are	796.62	5.159
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	falling and index also falls from 17 000	798.839	6.12
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to let's say 15 000 or 13 000 then what	801.779	4.381
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	do you think is going to happen well	804.959	3.241
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	will covet like Market Panic can happen	806.16	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	a lot of heat will be faced by current	808.2	3.42
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	setting government a lot of problems	810.06	2.94
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	will be faced by them so Market	811.62	3.06
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	management needs to be done and there	813.0	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	are something called as market makers so	814.68	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Market maker simply means that for	816.48	3.419
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example when other people are Panic	818.04	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	selling during covert times a lot of	819.899	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	people sold everything literally then	821.88	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	someone needs to buy right so you have	823.86	3.599
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	organizations like SBI you have	825.66	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	organizations like LIC so they become	827.459	4.021
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	prominent market makers so this	829.62	3.899
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	mechanism is not bad the index actually	831.48	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	needs to be managed from time to time in	833.519	3.781
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	order to avoid Mass planning but here is	835.5	3.54
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the problem in terms of incorporating	837.3	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	bad companies into index now imagine a	839.04	4.38
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	scenario where fundamentally weak	841.62	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies are a part of nifty 50 then	843.42	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what needs to be done well then in that	845.82	4.319
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	scenario Market needs to be artificially	847.74	4.8
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	kept alive it needs to be put on a	850.139	4.861
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	ventilator and just so that Panic Neo is	852.54	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you know what Market needs to be	855.0	2.88
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	supported index management needs to be	856.26	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	done what I'm simply trying to say and I	857.88	3.06
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	hope this point did not become	859.86	3.419
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	complicated that index management is not	860.94	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	bad sometimes the market overall	863.279	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	fundamentals are such that people need	865.26	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to step in or governments need to step	867.12	3.3
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	in and manage the market nothing wrong	868.74	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	with it but if as a system your top	870.42	4.8
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	index which is nifty 50 index ends up	872.76	4.8
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	imbibing a lot of bad companies for	875.22	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	whatever reason then the market needs to	877.56	3.959
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	be artificially supported so this is the	879.72	3.479
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	precise problem that I am trying to tell	881.519	3.541
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you because what it does in the long	883.199	3.541
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	terms is that it makes the market	885.06	4.079
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	fundamentally weaker so these are three	886.74	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	specific problems that I see playing out	889.139	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	in this entire scenario and now comes	891.06	3.719
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the natural question that what is it	893.339	2.881
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that you should be doing as a stock	894.779	2.941
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	market investor you should be doing	896.22	3.119
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	index investing not doing index	897.72	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investing so here is my viewpoint on it	899.339	3.781
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	so Point number one is that if you are	901.44	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	doing index investing it is not buy and	903.12	3.959
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	forget in investing anymore because	904.92	3.719
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	right now the markets are being	907.079	3.421
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	artificially kept alive one could argue	908.639	3.781
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	definitely now when in a bull run	910.5	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	scenario what is going to happen that in	912.42	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the bull run the individual stocks are	914.22	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	going to give more run-up which are	916.5	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	fundamentally strong but bad stocks will	917.94	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	suffer more so in such circumstances the	919.98	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	chances of nifty 50 doing their dance	922.26	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	like this in a certain range becomes	924.3	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	much higher and as a Nifty or indexed	926.04	4.38
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investor you are not going to make much	928.62	3.899
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	money so this is becoming a fundamental	930.42	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	problem because fundamentally bad	932.519	3.781
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies are becoming a part of index	934.38	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	so this is the overarching perspective	936.3	3.479
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that develops so this is point number	937.98	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	one so in this regard what you should	939.779	4.261
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	definitely do is that whenever you are	941.94	5.579
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investing in nifty 50 or any index have	944.04	6.06
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	a very clear exit Target now what do I	947.519	4.44
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	mean by that so this is a post that I	950.1	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	made on the member Community tab of	951.959	3.421
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	YouTube and on the wisdom hatch	953.82	4.379
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	community that hey I had purchased index	955.38	5.16
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	nifty 50 here my first clear sales	958.199	5.161
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Target is with a gain of 5 and my second	960.54	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	clear sales Target is somewhere around 9	963.36	3.779
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and a half percent and explain the	965.22	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	entire rationale of this move in the	967.139	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	member Community now you might agree you	968.82	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	might not agree with my viewpoint there	970.98	3.419
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	are pros and cons to it but to cut the	972.48	3.419
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	long story short whenever you are taking	974.399	4.201
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	entry into a particular index have a	975.899	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	very clear Viewpoint as to when you are	978.6	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	going to exit and why third key point	980.399	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	please avoid indices where you do not	982.5	4.44
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	know what the back end of the index is	984.959	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	for example I gave you the example of	986.94	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	sharia index you might might not	988.8	3.779
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	understand it so please go and read	990.72	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	through the methodology so this is what	992.579	3.721
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the index methodology looks like now if	994.32	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you understand it please go and build a	996.3	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	position no doubt about that also avoid	998.04	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investing in a bad index for example	1000.62	4.139
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	fundamentally speaking that Nifty next	1002.72	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	50 is generally not a good investment	1004.759	3.901
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	instrument for normal retail investors	1006.74	3.959
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to chunk their money into so this is	1008.66	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what my point of view is I've explained	1010.699	3.181
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you the rationale earlier now if you	1012.32	3.0
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	feel otherwise definitely go and build	1013.88	3.06
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	position no doubt about it now then	1015.32	3.54
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	comes the final point that going forward	1016.94	4.259
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	if something becomes a system for	1018.86	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example if retail investors are	1021.199	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	generally putting more money in index	1023.06	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	funds what do you think is going to	1025.16	3.419
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	happen have you seen retail investors	1026.66	3.899
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	ever make money sustainably in any	1028.579	3.661
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	particular asset class in any particular	1030.559	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	field the answer is no so you tell me	1032.24	3.54
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what is going to happen to index	1034.579	3.061
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investing and what is the future of	1035.78	3.779
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	index investing in India so from that	1037.64	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	perspective if you're smart enough to	1039.559	4.201
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	pick this particular trait then you must	1041.24	4.439
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	understand that at some stage you need	1043.76	4.62
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to graduate from index investing over to	1045.679	4.801
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	individual stock picking or at least	1048.38	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	understanding how to time the index	1050.48	3.78

1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Friend 1: Hey, do you know Dmart is running on discount?	3.09	2.6
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Friend 2: What are you saying, man?	5.89	2.0
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	First, your sentence is wrong. Dmart is not running in “discount”, “discount” is running in Dmart. Secondly, there is always a discount at Dmart.	7.95	10.37
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Friend 1: See, this is the difference. You are talking about shopping "in" Dmart, and I am talking about shopping "of" Dmart.	18.52	6.86
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Well, you won't understand me. Groww's audience is very smart, I will go and talk to them only.	26.04	5.42
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Radhakishan Damani ji's Avenue Supermarts, which operates arguably our go-to monthly grocery store Dmart,	31.97	6.93
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	has given its investors nearly 500% returns since its listing in March 2017.	38.95	6.66
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	We all probably buy our household ration from Dmart because of the huge discounts, isn't it?	46.13	5.13
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	The family goes to Dmart one day in the month and buys the whole month's ration, snacks, cosmetics, and whatnot.	51.46	9.1
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	They go to take 10 things and come back with 20.	60.76	3.79
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Must have happened to you too, right? Who doesn't love a last-minute discount?	64.75	3.83
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	But such a company which gives a lot of discounts to the customers of its company, today it is trading at a discount in the stock market.	68.78	7.86
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Surprisingly, after the listing, its investors have not received negative returns in any year till now, but in 2022, this streak of Dmart was broken.	76.84	11.54
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Yes, DMart's share had fallen over 12.90% in 2022.	88.58	4.76
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	So is this a buying opportunity?	93.54	2.37
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Are there any fundamental challenges in Dmart's business due to which market participants are shying away to pay premiums to Dmart's stock?	96.11	8.8
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Let us know in today's video.	105.11	2.0
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	If we have to identify the challenge in Dmart's business, then first of all we have to understand their business model very well.	112.21	7.88
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Whenever we go shopping in Dmart, all the products there can be mainly divided into 3 categories.	120.29	7.73
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Food products such as groceries, frozen products, processed foods, beverages, cooking oils, dairy products, snacks, fruits, vegetables, etc.	128.22	8.35
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Next is non-food FMCG products such as all small things related to personal care, toiletries, home care, etc.	136.77	7.29
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	And General Merchandise and Apparel or GM&A includes Bed and Bath, Toys and Games, Crockery, Footwear, Home Appliances, etc.	144.26	10.24
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	In short, from household pins to cargo pants, from food to cleaning, you will find it all at Dmart.	154.7	8.71
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Out of the 3 major segments, the Foods category alone contributes about 55% of DMart's total revenue to DMart's total revenue.	163.61	8.51
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	The contribution of non-food items is 20.50%, and the share of GM&A is 24.75%.	172.34	5.68
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Now ask your question, after all, why do we wait to go to Dmart on the weekend after the items are stocked?'	178.22	7.11
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Discount'. Isn't it? We get even the smallest items at a discount in Dmart, which considerably reduces our total bill.	185.53	7.94
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	So, if the discount is the whole game then why don't normal retailers give discounts? Here comes the matter of 'volume'.	193.67	7.49
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	There will be a massive difference in the volume of purchase by a retailer when the goods are standing and of the same product by Dmart.	201.68	8.72
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Let's understand by example.	211.02	1.17
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	A retail store buys 100 units of an item of Rs.100, assuming its MRP is Rs. 115, i.e. the retailer got a 15% margin.	212.75	10.4
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	So for selling 100 units, the retail store gets Rs. 1,500 profit, right?	223.31	4.88
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	But when Dmart buys the same item, it places an order for 1,000 units instead of 100.	228.63	6.24
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Now in front of such a big order, Dmart has a secret weapon called 'Negotiation Power'.	235.29	6.37
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	When you buy the same on this scale, you get even more discount.	241.86	5.04
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	After all, the next supplier, who gets more profit at the same time, also agrees to give a discount.	247.0	6.52
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	So let's say that DMart sells the same product for Rs. 90.	253.96	3.499
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	So even if Dmart has priced that product at Rs. 115  then their margin will be around 27%.	257.66	6.49
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	But then what will be the difference between Dmart and retailers?	264.23	3.51
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	DMart believes that they may keep the margin low, but their sales volume should be very high.	267.94	5.74
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	That is, DMart focuses on the volume game. And Dmart does this by offering products to consumers at a lower price than the market.	273.88	7.64
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	So the item which is available in the market is for Rs. 115, Dmart may attract customers like us by selling at Rs.100, and also earns profit itself.	281.72	10.99
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	The profit margins of Dmart are very low but because of this, they make it very difficult for normal retailers to compete.	292.91	8.0
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	DMart's operating profit margins have been around 8% for the past few financial years. This is called the 'Deep Discount Strategy'.	301.21	7.39
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	You will find the same strategy in US retail giant, Walmart as well.	308.66	4.12
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	So, DMart can sell its regular orders easily, and with this, DMart always has fresh products on its shelves, which are liked by new customers.	313.26	9.43
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Because of this, DMart has to face a lot of issues like wastage or decay.	322.81	5.25
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Apart from this, if you visit your nearest DMart, you will notice that the infrastructure and setup of DMart stores are very simple.	328.4	8.97
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	From above, DMart's maximum operates on an ownership model.	337.57	4.09
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	This means that most of the stores they own are self-contained, which makes their rental rates comparable to those of their competitors!	341.86	8.02
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Their stores are also not in fancy locations as their real estate expenses are relatively low.	350.35	5.88
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	The impact of all these factors can be seen in the profitability of the company.	356.85	3.55
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	In fact, due to this strategy, DMart has become the retail king of India today.	360.6	4.58
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	The company has compounded its sales at a rate of 30% in the last 10 years, while at the same time, its profits have compounded at 38%.	365.38	7.6
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Now you must be thinking that the business model of Dmart is solid, then what problems can arise in it?	373.24	6.08
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	See, every business has its challenges, and DMart has them too. Let's understand.	379.52	5.04
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	DMart stock is down 34.56% from October 2021 peak.	384.97	5.55
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	In the last 1 year also the stock price of DMart has gone down by about 12.39%.	390.72	4.95
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	The bearish trend in the overall markets and macroeconomic factors are behind the underperformance in the stock market,	395.87	6.92
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	but there are some factors related to Dmart's business that have not played out positively for them.	403.25	5.93
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	High-growth stocks which trade at a premium valuation in the market against their competition also have high market expectations.	409.6	8.28
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Only one negative news or bad quarter can eat away at the company's premium valuation.	418.08	5.89
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Any factor that can affect the growth of these companies or if the revenue and profit growth numbers of such companies	424.17	7.41
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	fall below the estimates of market experts and analysts, then their stock prices can correct very quickly.	431.78	6.46
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	And this is what happened with Dmart.	438.63	1.86
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	This stock, which was trading at a PE  of 313.9 times in October 2021, is today trading at around a PE of 100.	440.69	8.05
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Let's talk about the company's results for the quarter that ended December 22.	448.94	3.96
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	There was growth in the company's sales and operating profit, but they could not meet the estimates of the market.	453.05	6.12
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Due to this, there were a lot of corrections in the share prices of Dmart.	459.36	3.55
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Even the company's gross margin has declined by 60 basis points year-on-year, and by 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter.	463.41	6.87
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Now, one of the reasons behind these declining margins is the decline in General Merchandise and Apparel i.e. GM&A segment.	470.48	7.78
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	See, most of Dmart's revenue comes from the food and FMCG segments, but the company's margins in these are very low.	478.79	7.23
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Thus, the GM&A segment is the only category that supports its margins.	486.26	4.67
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	And in the December’22 quarter, the company's food and FMCG sales growth was faster than that of the GM&A segment.	491.52	7.81
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Therefore, the overall profit margin was impacted due to the lower contribution of GM&A to their total sales.	499.53	6.8
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Think for yourself, you have 2 products. Both cost Rs. 100. But you can sell one at Rs. 110 and the other for Rs. 150.	506.53	9.279
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	So which product would you like to sell more? The same product with higher margins, right? Similar is the case in Dmart.	516.01	8.56
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	DMart wants customers to buy clothes, crockeries, toys, and home appliances along with food and FMCG items to boost their margins.	524.77	11.91
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	And generally, the company's margins are historically strong in the December quarter due to the festive season.	537.21	5.82
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	And good sales are also seen in the GM&A segment.	543.23	3.78
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	But this year, the company's December quarter margin hit a multi-year low.	547.21	4.47
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Experts and brokerage houses say that inflation is the reason for the decline in sales growth of the GM&A segment.	552.24	6.52
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Due to inflation, the discretionary spending of the people has come down.	558.96	3.71
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Discretionary expenses mean such expenses which are not necessary for a common man in his day-to-day life.	562.87	7.94
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Apart from this, another big reason is the bad competition in this sector.	571.01	4.02
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	That too from big players like Reliance Retail and Tata Group-backed Big Basket.	575.57	4.05
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	The company is also facing competition from quick commerce players like Zepto, Blinkit, and Swiggy Instamart.	580.09	6.57
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	However, to compete with these online players, Dmart has also started its online service Dmart Ready.	587.18	6.76
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	You might have also seen these new Dmart Ready stores near your home.	594.14	4.66
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Customers can order online through the Dmart Ready app, and then they can pick up their order from the nearest Dmart Ready store.	599.0	8.43
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	And if you want the order delivered to your home, then Dmart will deliver it to your home by charging you the delivery fee.	607.63	8.01
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Now let's move on to another important metric - 'Revenue from sales per square foot of retail business area'.	616.13	5.94
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Then, in short, revenue per square foot. To calculate this, we divide a company's total sales by the total area of all its stores.	622.27	9.43
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	So this metric shows how much sales Dmart is able to generate from 1 square foot of area,	632.24	5.45
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	which essentially shows how efficiently they are using their storage area.	637.89	5.58
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	As you can see from the numbers on the screen, there is no growth here but a big decline is being seen.	643.74	6.69
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	That is, the company's operating efficiency has reduced, and it is now earning less revenue per square foot of land than before.	650.63	8.34
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Two things emerge from this. The revenue numbers of the new stores that the company is opening are below expectations.	659.23	7.05
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Then the size of the company's stores is more as compared to earlier, the total area of which has been increased.	666.48	5.48
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	When we studied, it was found that the new stores which Dmart is opening for the last 3-4 years are relatively bigger in size,	672.39	7.53
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	more than 50,000 square feet in area, i.e, the company is now opening much bigger stores than before.	680.12	6.19
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Opening of larger stores and declining sales in the GM&A segment, both these regions have not only resulted in higher revenue per sq. ft.,	686.51	8.01
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	but smaller new store additions are also taking a hit.	694.72	2.73
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	DMart added 4 new stores in Q3FY23, which is September quarter base and well below market estimates.	697.97	9.06
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	For example, Motilal Oswal Securities was expected to add 12 new stores.	707.18	4.28
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	For example, when there are conditions like inflation and rising interest rates in the market,	712.09	4.17
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	then in a way, opening fewer stores to the management can also be a safe step.	716.32	4.54
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	But what the management thinks and what the market expects, the timing may not match.	721.12	6.0
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	And the conservative thinking of the FIR management may also indicate that it may take a little more time to pick up demand and growth.	727.71	7.36
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	So this was a detailed analysis of the recent performance of DMart.	735.65	3.96
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	It remains to be seen whether DMart will be able to convert India's growth story into its own growth story.	739.79	5.01
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	After all, whenever we talk about India's growth, the growth of the middle-class population cannot be ignored in any way.	745.0	7.81
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	Similarly, Dmart, which is targeting the growth of the middle-class population, would also like to take advantage of this opportunity.	753.01	6.95
1jzzbp2hkog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzzbp2hkog	So what would you like to buy - the same from Dmart or Dmart's shares in this correction? Do tell in the comments.	760.16	6.54

5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	like what about budget 2023 exactly that's what we  are going to discuss in today's video but before	36.66	4.74
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	I reveal the name of the stock let me give you  uh I mean let me give a quick shout out to these	41.4	4.98
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	two people for their wonderful comments their  names are Nikhil and Shibani. Thanks a lot for	46.38	4.14
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	motivating me. And the name of the company is GNFC  that is Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers Company	50.52	8.1
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	Limited. Well this company is a Joint Sector  Enterprise which is promoted by two entities	58.62	5.28
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	the very first one is Gujarat State Investments  Limited or GSIL which holds 21.38% in the company	63.9	6.96
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	and it it is also jointly promoted by Gujarat  State Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited which is	70.86	5.7
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	GSFC and it holds 19.8 percent in this company.  This company was started in or it was set up in	76.56	7.32
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	Bharuch way back in 1976 but it's manufacturing  and marketing operations started in 1982. Now	83.88	7.2
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	that you know some basic points about the company  let's also try and understand the various business	91.08	3.84
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	segments of the company and for that have  a look at this chart. You can very clearly	94.92	3.84
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	see that GNFC has three major segments basically  they manufacture and trade in what? fertilizers,	98.76	7.02
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	which gives them or which generates almost 29.61  percent of their total revenue, the second segment	105.78	6.18
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	is that they manufacture bulk chemicals which  contributes to 69.37 percentage of their revenue	111.96	5.94
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	and the last one is a very minor chunk which is  about IT and it contributes barely one percent to	117.9	5.7
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	the total revenue of the company. Now that we know  that the company is mainly into three business	123.6	5.94
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	segments let's try and dig down deep into each  and every business segment. The first one would	129.54	4.8
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	be fertilizer segment for that have a look at this  chart we can very clearly see like we discussed	134.34	4.32
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	earlier they are into even manufacturing as well  as trading what are they manufacturing? They are	138.66	4.56
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	manufacturing various fertilizers like UREA and  Ammonium Nitrophosphate and they are selling them	143.22	4.86
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	under the brand name Narmada. They are also  into trading of various fertilizers like DAP,	148.08	5.4
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	MOP, SSP, Ammonium Sulfate and City Compost okay.  Other than all these things they are also making	153.48	6.36
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	products which are used directly by end customer  something like what something like a face wash,	159.84	4.68
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	hand sanitizer or even if I'm talking about  shampoos they are manufacturing and selling this	164.52	4.5
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	under the GNFC Neem Project. All in all I can say  just for your additional information fertilizers	169.02	5.88
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	are used for what? They are mainly going to be  used so that the overall fertility of the soil	174.9	5.28
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	increases and overall growth of the plant also  increases. If I were to talk about the fertilizer	180.18	5.46
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	industry in India giving you some stats on that  you can see here that as on 2022 the market size	185.64	7.02
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	or the market value of Indian fertilizers industry  as a whole is at 898.5 billion rupees and which is	192.66	7.32
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	approximately 2 percent of India's GDP this is set  to grow to 1188.3 billion rupees by end of 2028	199.98	8.7
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	with a CAGR of 4.5 percent. Now you can understand  that with the rising population of India don't you	208.68	6.54
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	think that the demand for fertilizers is anyways  going to grow? Answer is obviously Yes, but not	215.22	4.98
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	only population if you have a look at this chart  you will be able to see that the urban population	220.2	4.44
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	is also continuously rising, now you might be  like what is the relevance of urban population?	224.64	4.02
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	Logic is very simple with more and more urban  population in the cultivable land is going to	228.66	5.7
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	decrease there are going to be more IT Parks  and all that encroaching into all these lands	234.36	4.44
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	and that is the reason why more and more crop will  be expected from lesser and lesser land and with	238.8	6.06
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	this the demand for what? demand for fertilizers  is again going to increase. I'll also give you	244.86	4.92
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	an important data point which mentions that  whatever is the requirement of fertilizers out	249.78	4.98
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	of that India Imports 30 percent and if that is  a huge amount is what you feel if of course that	254.76	6.54
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	is a big amount then I feel that there's a big  headroom left for the existing players in India.	261.3	4.92
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	Let's move ahead with the next segment that is  the Chemical segment and for that let's understand	266.94	4.68
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	some basic data points first in 2019 you can  see that the Indian Chemicals Market stood at	271.62	5.46
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	178 billion dollars and it is forecasted to reach  304 US billion dollars by 2025. India is the sixth	277.08	8.4
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	largest producer of chemicals but I'm sure you  might be like chemicals as an industry does it	285.48	4.86
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	have any subparts or it's just like chemicals full  stop? No, it has some parts it looks something	290.34	4.62
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	like this chemical industry can be further broken  down into something like Bulk chemicals, Specialty	294.96	4.98
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	Chemicals, Petrochemicals, Agrochemicals,  Fertilizers, Biotech, Pharma, API and a lot	299.94	5.7
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	more okay but out of these what does this company  focus more on? They focus more on manufacturing of	305.64	6.06
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	Bulk Chemicals. Now what is this? what are these  Bulk Chemicals used for? They are mainly used as a	311.7	5.52
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	raw material for various Specialty Chemicals okay  so they are going to be used as a raw material for	317.22	5.64
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	manufacture of various Specialty Chemicals  but you might be like where are they used?	322.86	3.72
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	For that have a look at this chart. You will  understand that oh my God we are surrounded by	327.12	5.58
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	GNFC products not directly of course indirectly  but almost 24x7. The the various chemicals that	332.7	6.78
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	they manufacture are used in making medicines or  mattresses, furniture, Interiors, perfumes, shoes,	339.48	6.12
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	clothes and what not and as we discussed before  they are also used for food grain produced using	345.6	5.76
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	fertilizers which is the usage for UREA. Now let's  quickly wrap up the third segment that is the IT	351.36	6.72
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	segment, here you can see what all products or  services they offer out of these I'm sure you are	358.08	4.2
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	aware about something like CCTV, digital signature  and data center. We are not going to waste a lot	362.28	4.68
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	of time on this reason is simple they contribute  barely one percent to the revenue to the company.	366.96	4.02
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	With this I hope you have understood the three  major segments one was fertilizers one was	371.52	5.28
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	chemicals and the third one was IT. If you want  to learn more about how to do fundamental analysis	376.8	5.58
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	of various companies for that we have a separate  course on our website www.rachanaranade.com and	382.38	6.48
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	also I hope you are aware about our Pro investor  membership yearly membership wherein you can get	388.86	4.92
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	an access to detailed analysis of more than  40 listed companies so for that also don't	393.78	6.06
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	forget to check out our website and if you want  you can use that special coupon code as well.	399.84	3.9
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	Now let's have a look at the financials of the  company and for that let's go on to screener.in,	404.46	5.16
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	here we have Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers  and Chemicals Limited and here you can see that	409.62	4.92
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	the market cap is just 8,920 crores so warning  this is a small cap company okay and the moment	414.54	7.56
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	it's a small cap company risk is ideally on a  shared higher side now if you see here all in	422.1	5.52
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	all basic or major ratios ROE at 24.5 percent,  ROCE at 33.1 percent the industry PE is 14.6	427.62	8.58
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	but stock PE is just 4.47 the p2bv is also  just 1.06 so all in all valuation parameters	436.2	7.68
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	look good for the company, even debt to equity  is zero because they don't have any debt right	443.88	4.86
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	now so that also looks good. If I were to go  on to the PE ratio versus EPS here you can see	448.74	6.48
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	some interesting relation in this so here you  can see that the EPS is continuously rising,	455.22	6.0
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	just one last uh quarter you can see a little  bit of dip but PE is continuously going down	461.22	5.88
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	it means that there is a chance that the price  might catch up with the EPS of the company. Now	467.1	5.94
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	if you want to see here as per screener there  are only pros not cons but for that have a look	473.04	4.44
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	at this this very clearly mentions that the pros  and cons are machine generated so don't feel that	477.48	4.56
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	this company has no disadvantages or no cons.  If I were to go on directly to the yearly or	482.04	5.64
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	the final P&L of the company you can see that the  sales TTM is at an all-time high at 10,435 crores,	487.68	8.94
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	operating profit margin also looks fair enough at  25 percent of course last year's that is 2022 OPM	496.62	6.84
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	was at 28% so it'll be interesting to watch the Q3  as well as Q4 results. PBT is almost again at an	503.46	7.26
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	all-time high uh for TTM as well and net profit is  also at an all-time high. We did talk about ROE,	510.72	6.24
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	we did talk about the overall growth as well sales  growth is good, compounded profit growth is good,	516.96	4.68
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	stock price CAGR is also not bad at all the point  about borrowings we said it's a very negligible	521.64	5.22
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	uh debt equity so upar it was given zero it might  be 0.00 something so almost negligible with just	526.86	5.94
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	8 CR of uh borrowings and here also we'll have to  check whether it's a long term no it's not a long	532.8	4.98
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	term borrowing so that might be the reason why for  debt equity ratio being zero. Even if you have a	537.78	4.8
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	look at one more very important point which is  the Cash Conversion Cycle. You can see that it	542.58	3.9
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	has gone down from 103 days to just 60 days so  this is also a positive point for the company.	546.48	5.28
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	If you have a look at the shareholding pattern  you can see that promoters holding is constant	553.02	3.66
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	at 41.18 percent FIIS holding has dropped a  little bit almost by two percent but this has	556.68	6.12
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	been covered up by public wherein their holdings  has increased from 31 percent to 33 percent. This	562.8	5.76
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	is about the key highlights about the financials  but what about the technicals for this? So for	568.56	5.1
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	that let me just zoom into the chart for GNFC  and we just close the pivot okay this gives	573.66	8.4
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	us a cleaner picture and if you were to observe  this so this was the recent high for the company	582.06	5.76
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	and we would want to draw a trend line from here  so here you can see the company is into more of	587.82	6.18
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	higher highs or lower highest formation answer  is about lower highs okay I have not joined it	594.72	6.78
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	very nicely okay so this is a rough uh joining  points and here you can also see the lower band	601.5	6.96
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	is somewhere here and it's very clearly visible  that the stock is in this channel now it will be	608.46	6.48
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	interesting to see whether the channel is broken  on the upper side or on the lower side but right	614.94	5.1
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	now as of now I feel it's lower side seems around  500 and upper side seems around 650 ish but what	620.04	6.9
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	about pivot levels? For pivot levels you can see  that 560 ideally should act as a strong support	626.94	5.64
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	for the stock. If this is broken then what? So  for that we should go to the one week chart and	632.58	6.54
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	I would just quickly remove the pivot points  and these two drawings as well and here if I	639.12	6.48
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	were to now see I'll just zoom out the picture  here okay this was a recent high after which the	645.6	6.48
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	stock tanked quite a bit it was taken out it went  up straight high and now it is trying to retrace	652.08	5.04
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	to this level so if I were to check this level it  comes to 550 okay so if I if you were to ask me	657.12	9.0
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	550 does this sound like a good support? Answer  is yes and if you remember for the daily chart	666.12	5.52
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	also the pivot I'm going to again switch that  on pivot is around 560 level so as per weekly	671.64	7.14
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	candle or even as per daily pivot 550 looks to  be a strong support. Well now that we know about	678.78	5.94
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	the fundamentals and technicals of the company  let's try and focus on some positive points and	684.72	4.2
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	certain risk factors involved let's kick start  with positives first with a vision to become	688.92	5.46
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	a global powerhouse the company is focusing more  on capacity expansions if you have a look at this	694.38	5.52
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	you'll be able to see that they are expanding  the capacity of ammonia of weak nitric acid and	699.9	5.04
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	of ammonium nitrate melt by all these metric tons  per annum and it is the total capex is estimated	704.94	6.66
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	to be around 1,350 crores which is going to be  commercialized by 2025 -26. They are also planning	711.6	7.8
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	to do more capex on what? On green hydrogen  with renewable power capacities and for this the	719.4	6.72
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	estimated outlay is around 2,900 crores. Now with  the FA,TA and positives we have to understand that	726.12	7.44
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	there are certain risks also which are involved  here the very first could be fierce competition	733.56	4.26
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	from dominant foreign suppliers you might be like  why where do foreign suppliers come into play if	737.82	6.06
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	you remember we said that 30 percent of our total  requirement is made by what imports and if foreign	743.88	6.0
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	players have deep pockets they can definitely  disrupt up this entire industry so this could	749.88	5.34
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	be a fierce competition and it could be a risk to  the company, second one could be the subsidies and	755.22	6.0
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	the raw material cost mismatch so typically what  happens is that government declares XYZ rupees a	761.22	5.16
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	subsidy per kg let us say currently it is okay it  is fitting into the equation but assume that after	766.38	6.6
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	two or three months the raw material costs are  pushed up now the subsidy amount might be lower	772.98	5.7
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	as compared to the raw material cost and with this  the profitability of the company can get hampered	778.68	5.7
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	the third one is that 65 percent of the fertilizer  revenue is coming only from Gujarat so this is	784.38	6.6
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	like a concentration related point and finally  fertilizer business of course it's dependent	790.98	4.38
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	on agriculture on monsoon so any adverse impact on  this might have a negative impact on the business.	795.36	5.46
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	Now before we conclude today's video let's try  and understand what could be the expectations from	802.02	5.4
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	this budget about the fertilizers and chemical  space if I want to talk about November 2022	807.42	6.0
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	the minister of chemicals and fertilizers Mr.  Mansukh Mandaviya said that due to the higher	813.42	5.52
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	global prices India's fertilizer subsidy bill  for 2023 would rise to a record high of 2 lakh	818.94	8.16
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	25,000 crores and this would be up from the  previous year's budget which was only 1 lakh	827.82	5.28
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	50,000 crore rupees so that's that could be a  significant jump, now you only imagine that if	833.1	4.5
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	subsidies are going to be higher is there going to  be a good or a bad sign for the company? Obviously	837.6	4.56
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	it's going to be a good sign for the company,  second one government may also increase the	842.16	4.32
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	UREA subsidy from 268 rupees per kg to 288  rupees per kg again a positive sign for	846.48	7.02
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	the company and finally PM Narendra Modi is also  being more vocal about chemical free fertilizers	853.5	7.08
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	or chemical free farming or natural farming he's  planning to come up with PM Pranam Yojana and it	860.58	6.78
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	is expected that it will be launched soon where  we can expect some announcements about in the	867.36	5.58
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	budget regarding the R&D and Innovations in this  sector. Well I hope you enjoyed the fundamental	872.94	5.94
5WTw4K4OxYI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTw4K4OxYI	analysis of GNFC and I would request everyone  to share your analysis one positive point one	878.88	6.12

RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	needles they sounded like they were	141.06	3.66
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	barely sustainable because I mean they	142.739	3.72
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	can't even offer one sick day to their	144.72	3.12
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	workers or they're probably just about	146.459	3.301
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	to go out of business they're about to	147.84	4.979
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	derail so to speak yeah and I mean at	149.76	3.96
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	best they're going to be very human	152.819	2.881
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	right that is weird that they made that	153.72	4.08
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	other company made seven billion dollars	155.7	4.56
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	in profit that seems like	157.8	4.38
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	they might have a lot of money and that	160.26	3.66
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	they're just choosing to screw over	162.18	3.3
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	their workers	163.92	4.02
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	to make just another dollar okay now	165.48	4.56
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	what happens with stock BuyBacks	167.94	3.48
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	um well there's two main reasons you do	170.04	4.5
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	it uh one is Executives uh compensation	171.42	7.02
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	and options uh are a lot of times tied	174.54	6.3
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	to the stock price so if you buy back a	178.44	4.379
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	lot of stock it inflates the stock price	180.84	3.899
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	and then the executive compensation	182.819	4.861
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	becomes much higher so they have an	184.739	4.741
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	incentive to go oh the most important	187.68	4.139
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	investment we could make is not in our	189.48	4.44
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	workers hell no in our infrastructure	191.819	4.621

RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	my salary hell yes okay so that's by the	196.44	5.64
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	way guys they're not Angels they're not	200.04	4.919
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	Geniuses they're regular dudes	202.08	5.22
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	they that are just saying yeah of course	204.959	3.901

RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	no they're and which leads to the second	210.0	3.599
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	reason that they're doing these BuyBacks	212.28	3.179
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	they're taking it home before people	213.599	4.681

RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	attention paid to the railroads because	219.78	3.66
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	of the potential strike so there was	221.159	4.321
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	like extra heat that they normally never	223.44	4.32
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	see and and there could be a little bit	225.48	5.58
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	of like well if we do BuyBacks	227.76	5.339
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	a lot of that money just gets taken home	231.06	4.2
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	by the richest people in the company	233.099	5.22
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	shareholders Etc et cetera it's gone	235.26	4.259

RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	can happen uh but of course it won't	248.879	4.621
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	happen because	251.58	3.84
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	who's the one that crushed the workers	253.5	4.859
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	in politics in this particular case Joe	255.42	5.58
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	Biden yep and Pete bootage they came out	258.359	4.501

RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	legal ramifications Republicans didn't	272.639	3.661
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	do that I mean they would have and they	274.8	3.3

RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	I did Biden did do it he doesn't care	280.44	4.44
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	about the workers at all	283.02	4.8
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	he did corporate Democrats moderate	284.88	4.56
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	Democrats like mainstream media tells	287.82	3.54
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	you are these lovely human beings who	289.44	3.42

RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	Democratic agenda Joe Biden doesn't	292.86	3.72
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	believe in his own agenda he pretended	294.72	3.479
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	to be in favor of the unions and that	296.58	3.24
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	the most spectacular moment when he	298.199	3.421
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	could have helped them he could have	299.82	3.9
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	forced the company to take their terms	301.62	4.74
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	instead of uh taking the forcing the	303.72	4.74
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	workers to take the company's terms and	306.36	5.7
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	as always moderate Democrats are not at	308.46	5.459
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	all moderate they're massively	312.06	5.16
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	conservative on economic issues and and	313.919	5.28
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	mainstream media works with them to	317.22	4.44

RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	yeah that's why I personally think that	323.16	3.78
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	moderate centrists should be banned as	325.139	3.181
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	terms they're corporate Democrats	326.94	3.24
RPnfAlQo7yg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnfAlQo7yg	they're the locus of their politics is	328.32	3.18

ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	but more on that later on do you think	2.7	4.079
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	it's possible to invest 100 000 today	4.5	4.38
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	and make nearly two million dollars in	6.779	4.74
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	10 years well that may be the case if AI	8.88	5.219
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	is as legit as everyone thinks recent	11.519	4.381
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	estimates have the impact from AI being	14.099	4.321
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	at over 15 trillion dollars worldwide	15.9	4.62
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	with a compounding annual growth rate of	18.42	4.859
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	34 percent which means if you invested a	20.52	4.62
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	hundred thousand dollars today and had a	23.279	4.76
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	34 keger for 10 years it would be worth	25.14	5.639
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	1.88 million dollars and for that reason	28.039	4.481
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	I want to educate myself on the	30.779	3.181
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	companies that have the most potential	32.52	3.0
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	to gain from this type of innovation	33.96	3.72
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	which is also why I'm doing a series of	35.52	3.719
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	videos like the one today where I'm	37.68	2.64
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	going to highlight a handful of	39.239	2.521
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	companies that could stand to have	40.32	3.54
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	explosive growth over the next decade	41.76	4.02
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	based on how they're leveraging AI in	43.86	3.539
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	their business models and for those of	45.78	3.779
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	you that have a stronger interest in ETF	47.399	4.801
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	I will provide a top list of ETFs that	49.559	4.141
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	carry each of these companies that I	52.2	3.48
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	speak to this way if you choose to	53.7	3.48
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	research the companies further and	55.68	2.58
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	decide whether or not they're worth	57.18	3.24
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	investing in then at least I'm give you	58.26	4.319
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	more options for your portfolio and your	60.42	4.02
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	risk tolerance and if you're new to my	62.579	3.481
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	channel I'll simply state that I was	64.44	3.179
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	working on machine learning and AI	66.06	3.36
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	nearly 10 years ago when I was with	67.619	4.201
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	Amazon in fact when you're shopping on	69.42	4.68
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	Amazon for clothes you may notice that	71.82	3.659
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	different colored shirts or different	74.1	4.32
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	sizes probably have different prices not	75.479	4.261
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	sure if you see that as a good thing or	78.42	3.239
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	not but those different prices are there	79.74	3.66
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	because of me I was the one that	81.659	3.361
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	implemented that model that made that	83.4	3.899
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	happen and I can assure you there is a	85.02	5.099
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	good reason for it my point is I have a	87.299	3.96
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	very different perspective than most	90.119	2.401
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	people when it does come to tech	91.259	2.941
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	companies and I do try to share that	92.52	4.02
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	where I can and with that said let's get	94.2	3.72
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	started with a list of companies that	96.54	3.66
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	may have explosive growth over the next	97.92	4.739
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	decade the first company today is Adobe	100.2	4.26
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	and it's hard to believe that they have	102.659	4.201
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	been around for nearly 40 years but	104.46	4.199
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	they've recently been flexing their AI	106.86	3.66
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	muscles with the recent launch of adobe	108.659	4.201
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	Firefly which leverages generative AI	110.52	4.68
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	models within their software users can	112.86	3.84
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	create unique pictures from a text	115.2	2.879
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	prompt where they can use the images	116.7	3.84
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	without any copyright concern and we've	118.079	4.32
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	seen this from many other companies but	120.54	3.78
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	where they are different is how they	122.399	3.9
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	allow you to change the objects within a	124.32	3.9
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	picture like let's say a shirt that the	126.299	3.721
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	person's wearing without any effort at	128.22	3.48
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	all they also have a system called	130.02	4.02
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	Sensei geni that provides solutions to	131.7	4.02
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	larger companies that have marketing	134.04	3.24
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	workflows to generate materials used	135.72	3.599
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	within advertising or provide real-time	137.28	4.14
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	analytics and instant insights	139.319	3.661
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	leveraging their cloud computing	141.42	3.6
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	experience from my personal perspective	142.98	3.839
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	I've used the Photoshop feature of	145.02	3.54
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	generative fill to take a portion of a	146.819	3.601
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	picture and then allow the system to	148.56	3.66
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	fill in all the remaining empty spaces	150.42	3.42
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	and then there's also the ability to	152.22	3.06
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	change the color of a shirt and an image	153.84	3.72
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	let's say in my thumbnails it is pretty	155.28	4.319
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	incredible now in the first estate that	157.56	3.539
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	I am not a huge fan of their	159.599	2.761
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	subscription models for all their	161.099	3.121
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	software but that does allow them to	162.36	3.42
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	roll out new software and features on	164.22	3.48
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	demand and it also creates a strong	165.78	4.08
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	model for consistent cash flow currently	167.7	5.46
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	Adobe stock is at 420.25 cents where	169.86	6.44
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	it's up 24.9 percent year to date and up	173.16	6.359
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	73.71 over five years and if you compare	176.3	5.86
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	this to the S P 500 performance Adobe	179.519	4.8
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	has outperformed the market what I like	182.16	3.719
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	about Adobe is that they have massive	184.319	3.481
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	brand awareness and their financials are	185.879	3.781
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	extremely strong if you look across the	187.8	3.84
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	board of their profit margin being at 26	189.66	3.84
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	percent along with over 5 billion in	191.64	3.9
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	cash reserves they are investing and	193.5	4.319
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	managing their funds extremely well if	195.54	3.839
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	they can Implement AI within their video	197.819	3.601
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	editing before any others then they	199.379	3.78
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	could stand to have explosive growth	201.42	3.72
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	over the years the downside with Adobe	203.159	3.72
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	is that they've been having a lot of	205.14	3.12
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	negative press with some of their	206.879	3.661
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	software with major creators switching	208.26	3.78
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	away from their software and they're	210.54	3.72
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	being very vocal about it but overall	212.04	4.32
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	Adobe has AI features that we can all	214.26	4.259
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	see and use today which makes me	216.36	3.659
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	extremely excited for what they're going	218.519	3.421
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	to be working on next and that gives	220.019	3.901
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	this company a very strong stance to	221.94	3.719
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	gain with AI over the next decade	223.92	3.66
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	there's no doubt that AI is going to	225.659	3.72
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	enrich our lives and hopefully our bank	227.58	4.379
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	accounts too but not every year is going	229.379	4.381
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	to have incredible growth the past three	231.959	3.121
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	years have shown us that having a	233.76	3.42
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	diversified portfolio is the best way to	235.08	4.019
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	hedge against a financial storm but did	237.18	4.26
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	you know that the Ultra rich like Bezos	239.099	4.441
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	and Gates had access to Safe Haven	241.44	3.659

ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	in fact it outpaced the S P 500 by 131	248.58	6.78
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	percent from 1995 to 2022. and it has	252.299	4.981
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	near zero correlation to the stock	255.36	3.719
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	market which makes it a unique way to	257.28	3.179

ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	the next company I'll be discussing is	293.639	4.021
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	crowdstrike which is a major player in	295.56	4.199
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	cyber security where it seems only Nash	297.66	4.38
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	natural that a key segment to grow for a	299.759	3.901
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	very long time is in cyber security	302.04	3.78
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	where scammers and malware is getting	303.66	3.78
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	better and better along with their tools	305.82	3.48
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	that they use against us crowdstrike is	307.44	4.08
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	a leader in endpoint security which is	309.3	4.08
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	at the device level like our phones and	311.52	4.08
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	our laptops they happen to use AI to	313.38	4.08
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	Monitor and detect threats where they	315.6	4.319
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	survey over 2 trillion cyber events	317.46	4.86
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	every single day crowdstrike is in	319.919	4.141
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	growth mode where they aren't realizing	322.32	4.08
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	a profit quite yet but given that they	324.06	4.139
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	have been showing double-digit growth	326.4	3.72
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	for quite a while now they should be	328.199	3.961
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	flipping that profit switch any quarter	330.12	4.079
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	now and when that happens the stock will	332.16	4.259
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	probably have a major surge today their	334.199	4.321
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	stock is up over 45 percent year-to-date	336.419	4.081
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	and their five year is impressive at	338.52	4.92
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	over 140 percent this is a company that	340.5	4.74
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	I believe has long-term potential since	343.44	4.14
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	they are hyper focused on security the	345.24	4.08
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	downside is that a lot of big companies	347.58	4.26
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	like Microsoft are already in this space	349.32	5.04
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	but when you're a large company your	351.84	4.199
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	priorities easily shift depending on	354.36	3.899
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	what leadership wants unlike crowdstrike	356.039	4.081
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	that has only one key objective to	358.259	3.78
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	follow and that is solely cyber security	360.12	3.9
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	the next company has a cult-like	362.039	3.6
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	following where it has a fair amount of	364.02	4.38
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	hype and that's uipath where they are a	365.639	4.681
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	robotic process automation tool for	368.4	4.2
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	large-scale end-to-end automation they	370.32	4.02
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	offer an accelerated program to take	372.6	4.02
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	routine office tasks and then automate	374.34	4.02
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	those activities they work through an	376.62	3.419
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	entire process where they map and	378.36	4.14
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	digitize every single step that way	380.039	4.981
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	every input can be cataloged updated and	382.5	3.9
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	routed to other teams as needed	385.02	3.06
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	currently they work on major projects	386.4	3.359
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	for Industries such as banking medical	388.08	4.14
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	and sales most every company has a	389.759	4.021
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	unique set of systems that manage their	392.22	3.599
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	purchasing their sales finance and even	393.78	4.08
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	inventory this is where uipath could	395.819	3.6
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	come in and automate the processes	397.86	3.6
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	within an existing database and their	399.419	4.081
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	customers backend systems today their	401.46	4.44
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	stock is up 45.6 percent year-to-date	403.5	4.02
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	but they have not been public long	405.9	3.72
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	enough to have a five-year view uipath	407.52	4.2
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	is not making a profit today but it has	409.62	4.199
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	been improving each and every year but	411.72	4.44
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	their current margin is at a negative 11	413.819	4.261
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	percent and earlier I mentioned that	416.16	3.599
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	this company has a cult-like following	418.08	3.119
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	and I think that a lot of that has to do	419.759	3.361
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	with the fact that Arc Innovations has a	421.199	3.84
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	large percent of this company across	423.12	4.019
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	several of their funds Kathy Woods is	425.039	3.841
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	betting big on this company which can be	427.139	3.421
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	seen as a bit of a good thing and	428.88	3.42
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	possibly bad but since they went public	430.56	4.56
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	in 2021 it has been on a steep decline	432.3	5.04
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	in stock price and it may be beaten down	435.12	3.78
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	enough where it can finally begin to	437.34	3.24
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	turn that ship around but one thing that	438.9	3.96
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	they desperately need to do is invest in	440.58	3.6
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	some better marketing because their	442.86	3.48
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	material is very cheesy and it makes	444.18	3.6
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	them come across as much less	446.34	3.54
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	professional than they probably are the	447.78	4.8
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	next company today is umbrella which is	449.88	4.86
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	a fabulous semiconductor design company	452.58	4.5
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	that focuses on low power high	454.74	4.26

ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	autonomous driving and Robotics I think	467.099	3.6
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	we can all see how technology and	469.08	3.66
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	vehicles have exploded over the past few	470.699	4.5

ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	racing to compete on that platform this	475.199	3.78
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	is where umbrella comes in with their	477.3	3.899
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	central processing systems leveraging AI	478.979	4.801

ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	to be operating safely and reliably they	745.5	3.839

ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	357 percent and like many of the tech	762.139	4.781
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	companies they are operating in the red	765.0	5.1
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	with a negative 80 margin but luckily	766.92	4.8
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	they are a very small company and	770.1	3.299
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	they're dealing with small numbers which	771.72	4.02
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	can be both good and bad good in the	773.399	4.141
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	sense that they have a long Runway to	775.74	3.719
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	grow which can have a lot of upside for	777.54	4.56
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	an investor the downside is that it	779.459	3.901
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	wouldn't take much for another company	782.1	3.179
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	simply to come in and buy them out but	783.36	4.02

ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	cars for safety I think it's only going	787.38	3.84
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	to become more important over time and	789.3	3.479
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	the logistics Focus will give them	791.22	3.54
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	tremendous upside as well so long as	792.779	3.721
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	they can keep their lead and not fall	794.76	3.24
ngUlo33ZDEc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUlo33ZDEc	behind I think that they're going to do	796.5	3.839

Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	platform just for the sake of showcasing the  strategy all B and the Bitcoin chart with the	6.54	5.82
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	15 minute time frame but keep in mind that you  can use this strategy in many other different	12.36	5.46
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	charts with all the time frames as well now it's  time to add the first indicator to our charts	17.82	6.3
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	in order to do that we click on the indicators  option up here in tradingview website and when	24.12	6.3
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	these indicators Matrix and strategies tab opens  the type twin range filter in the search bar and	30.42	8.82
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	then we add this indicator to our charts after  adding the indicator to the Chart as you can see	39.24	6.78
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	this is just a simple Buy cell indicator but we  need to optimize this indicator by a tiny bit to	46.02	6.84
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	do that we open the setting of twin range filler  indicator and in the inputs tab we make sure that	52.86	6.36
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	this Source option is set to close then we change  the fast period option to 45 and the fast range	59.22	6.9
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	option to 2. we set the slow period to 145 and  finally we change the slow range option to 3.	66.12	7.86
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	there's nothing that we really need a change in  the style tab but if you want to you could change	76.02	5.34
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	the color of the signal icons to any color  you like after that optimization whenever	81.36	7.14
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	twin range Fielder indicator gives a long signal  you can enter a line trade like in this example	88.5	6.6
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	and also whenever the indicator shows  a short signal you can enter a short	98.1	4.98
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	trade as you can see in this example right here	103.08	2.64
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	these indicator signals are pretty  good but we could increase its win	108.84	4.32
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	rate even more in order to do that I'm  gonna use two other indicators for this	113.16	5.16
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	strategy so I open the indicators tab of  trading view again and this time search G	118.32	7.02
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	Channel Trend detection and I click on  this indicator to apply it to my chart	125.34	5.64
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	actually this indicator will be helping us to  figure out the short-term trend of the market	132.54	5.76
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	but we could improve the indicators visuals to  do that we open g-trend settings then we open the	138.3	7.2
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	style tab in this style tab we'll disable all  the options except the average option then we	145.5	6.54
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	change the opacity of color 0 to 100 percent and  also we set the opacity of color 1 to 100 too you	152.04	8.46
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	could also increase the thickness of both color  options as well to make it more visible now we can	160.5	6.06
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	close the tab G Trend indicator SS does a lot by  helping us detect fake signals this is how we use	166.56	8.22
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	this indicator whenever the trend of the market is  ascending meaning the price is above the G Trend	174.78	6.72
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	indicator and also the color of the g-trend graph  itself is green we should only enter long trades	181.5	7.08
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	and we avoid entering short trades for example we  got a long signal here trend is ascending because	188.58	6.66
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	the price is above G train indicator and D Trends  graph is also green so we could have used this	195.24	6.48
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	signal to enter a trade and made a 3.5 profit  from it in the spot mode which is truly a lot	201.72	7.8
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	of profit for a single trade in their spot mode  but right before that look at this signal we got	209.52	6.96
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	a short signal but the momentum is upwards reason  is that a v price is above G train indicator so in	216.48	7.44
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	a situation like this we should not have used this  signal to enter a trade and this signal would have	223.92	6.66
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	been considered a fake signal and with the help  of G train indicator they could have filtered it	230.58	5.82
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	and there's the exact opposite we can enter  a short trade only if we are in a descending	237.48	6.78
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	Trend that means the price should be below the  moving average graph of G Trend and the color of	244.26	6.12
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	moving average itself should also be read so in  this position on the chart we are currently in a	250.38	5.94
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	descending Trend and during this trend we can only  consider entering short trades here we've got one	256.32	5.82
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	and as I said because the momentum is downwards  we could have used this short signal to enter a	262.14	5.94
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	trade and make round two percent profit from the  trade India spot mode and also here we have a long	268.08	6.36
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	signal but because g-trend is red and the price  is under the EG Trend graph showcasing that the	274.44	5.34
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	trend is descending this signal is considered fake  and we can't use it to enter a trade this other	279.78	6.9
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	long signal is a fake signal too because it's in  a downward momentum we could detect all these fake	286.68	6.6
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	signals with the help of G train indicator and  save ourselves from probable future losses for	293.28	7.02
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	the third indicator I'm gonna add an indicator to  the chart that will help indicating the long-term	300.3	5.46
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	trend of the market so that with the knowledge  of both short-term and long-term trends trading	305.76	6.24
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	against the trend can be completely prevented  in this strategy we get back to the indicators	312.0	6.36
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	tab again we type Market bias in the search  bar and we add this indicator to the chart	318.36	5.04
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	after applying the indicator to the Chart open  the setting of Market bias and in their style	324.48	5.52
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	section disable the hey kinashi option completely  then change the opacity of all the background	330.0	6.24
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	color options to 70 percent the opacity  of all of them should be set to 70 percent	336.24	5.94
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	then we move to the inputs Tab and change the  period option in there to 200 then smoothing	351.12	7.14
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	option should be on 100 and oscillator  pre-adoption should be set to 7. okay now	358.26	7.32
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	we're done here so let's review the conditions  of trade entry one more time but this time feed	365.58	6.42
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	all three indicators for entering a line trade  first we need to get a long signal from Twin	372.0	5.76
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	range filler indicator then we need to make sure  that our signal is following the short-term trend	377.76	5.4
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	of the market for these to be true the price  has got to be above G Trend and the color of	383.16	5.88
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	G Trend graph should also be green next we gotta  make sure that the long-term trend of the market	389.04	5.94
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	is also ascending for these the price must be  above Market bias indicator and the graph of	394.98	6.3
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	Market bias itself has to be color green if all  these conditions are made the Candlestick below	401.28	6.18
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	which the line signal has been given would be  considered a signal all Candlestick and with	407.46	5.16
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	these candlesticks closing Thief would be able  to enter a trade at its closing price so I open	412.62	7.08
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	a long trading position at signal catalytics  closing price and for adjusting my stop loss I	419.7	5.82
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	could use G train indicator and set my establas  to the g-trends graph so I set the establast	425.52	6.12
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	to here the point and the g-trend graph exactly  below the signal cannabis stick and for exiting	431.64	5.7
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	the trade we could adjust our TP with a 1 to 1.5  risk reward ratio I could have gotten out of this	437.34	7.62
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	long trade with a profit of one two one point  five risk reward ratio also for entering short	444.96	7.8
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	trades we must first get a short signal from Twin  range filters indicator after that we have to be	452.76	5.82
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	sure that short-term and long-term trends are  both descending if the price is below g-trend	458.58	5.58
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	indicator and also the color of the g-train  graph is red then the short-term momentum is	464.16	5.16
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	downwards and if the price is below Market bias  indicator and the graph of Market bias itself is	469.32	6.42
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	red the long-term momentum is also downwards  currently in this situation the overall trend	475.74	6.18
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	of the market is descending so this short signal  can be considered a valid signal and with signal	481.92	6.0
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	Canal 6 closing meaning this Candlestick here we  can enter use its closing price to enter a short	487.92	6.3
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	trade like the line trade we could use the G Trend  graph as our establast level and set our stop loss	494.22	6.66
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	to it and for take profit exactly similar to buy  signal we could use 1 to 1.5 risk reward ratio	500.88	8.28
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	for better understanding this strategy they could  check out some more example in the market history	513.48	5.82
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	[Music]	536.3	1.0

Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	making only three trading positions in the 15  minute time frame of Bitcoin chart we could	558.6	7.5
Oy9_UBK37e8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9_UBK37e8	gain 147 percent profit and this is really  amazing and extraordinary profit with this	566.1	7.62

QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	free passive income and most of this money is  reinvested into my dividend stocks and REITs	102.54	6.18
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	through my drips that's what these green rows here  represent and I'm proud to say that most of my big	108.72	5.58
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	dividend players in my tfsa I have secured a drip  with the last one being primaris read we which I	114.3	6.12
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	locked in a few months ago you'll notice this  notification that I made an instant deposit I	120.42	5.04

QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	questrade so with that 900 deposit plus another  100 remaining after dividends and drips I have	131.1	7.2
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	over a thousand dollars ready to invest with today  but before that I want to update my Excel sheet to	138.3	6.0
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	include a recent dividend raise and that's with  Manulife it's here in yellow and that's because I	144.3	5.82
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	have a drip ratio of 2.78 I am very very close to  locking in three drips every quarter and with this	150.12	6.84
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	dividend raise it will help me get there Manulife  now pays out a dividend per share of 0.365 that	156.96	6.9
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	represents a 10 dividend raise that's wonderful  so enter this new dividend amount and you'll see	163.86	6.18
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	the drip ratio bump up as soon as I hit enter and  boom I now have a drip ratio of 3.07 that's great	170.04	6.84
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	but the drip isn't secure and that's because the  stock price has gone up Manulife has been doing	176.88	5.04
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	very well lately it's been recovering from the  drop last year so My max value of 28 dollars is	181.92	6.12
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	a little bit on the smaller side I'm going to buff  this up to 30 and when I do that my Excel sheet is	188.04	4.62
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	going to recalculate and my drip ratio is going  to drop down so my goal for today is to put 500	192.66	5.82
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	into Manulife to beef this up and secure that  drip of three shares every quarter looking at	198.48	6.3
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	manual life over the past three years they've been  doing very well since the crash of 2020 and I've	204.78	5.34

QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	past couple of months so the share price of these  Financial stocks have gone down but the dividend	318.18	4.8
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	has either remained steady or increased that's  why we're seeing inflated dividend yields across	322.98	5.58
QwArdTpg7ME	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwArdTpg7ME	the financial sector and that is reflected in  this ETF vdy with a great dividend yield of	328.56	6.06

9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	enough to do a valuation calculation	486.96	4.32
9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	I'll use the dividend discount model as	489.0	4.38
9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	an example this measures the value of a	491.28	4.56
9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	company by taking the sum of all future	493.38	4.8

9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	dividendata.com to start I'll enter the	506.419	6.04
9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	current share price of 45.33 and the	508.979	7.201
9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	annual dividend of 3.76 then I need to	512.459	5.401
9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	put a dividend growth rate projection	516.18	4.08
9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	I'm going to be conservative and enter a	517.86	4.619

9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	I'll put a discount rate of 10 percent	522.479	4.561
9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	this basically is measuring against a	524.7	4.5
9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	theoretical ten percent return with	527.04	4.56
9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	these inputs Altria is estimated to have	529.2	6.42
9emMPZxf8ms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9emMPZxf8ms	a present value of 61.23 per share this	531.6	5.66

7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	five-year average I don't really care what the  yield is only relative to itself I want to lock	91.68	5.46
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	in a higher starting yield than average second I  want a p e ratio that is below or at least in line	97.14	6.78
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	with its five year average the higher quality the  company is the more inclined I am to accept buying	103.92	5.16
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	at a fair value one of my favorite Warren Buffett  quotes something like this it's better to pay fair	109.08	5.82

7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	five-year average annual dividend growth rate of  at least five percent or better those are my five	141.72	5.22
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	criteria and here are four stocks that stood out  to me that look appealing for February 2023 please	146.94	6.0

7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	watch list I made a point to pick stocks I have  not featured all that much or at all and stick	157.56	5.4
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	around until the end there are a handful of stocks  I want to briefly show you that I think weren't a	162.96	5.1
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	place on your watch list some that I've covered  but are still at an appealing valuation so let's	168.06	5.1
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	get to it Company Number One Norfolk Southern  ticker NSC Norfolk Southern Railway is a Class	173.16	6.06
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	one Freight railroad that operates over 19  420 miles and 22 eastern U.S states they're	179.22	6.12
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	headquartered in Atlanta Georgia and along with  its Chief competitor CSX Transportation these	185.34	5.22
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	two companies form a duopoly over the freight  lines in the Eastern part of the United States	190.56	4.44
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	much like Union Pacific and Berkshire Hathaways  BNSF Railway do in the Western and Central United	195.0	6.0
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	States these companies have very wide modes due to  what is a nearly insurmountable barrier to entry I	201.0	6.66
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	personally own Union Pacific and if you follow  our Channel you know that's one of my favorite	207.66	3.3
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	stocks but recently Norfolk Southern announced  a nine percent dividend raise and looking things	210.96	5.1
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	over taking a closer dive into it I think this is  also a very high quality company and its valuation	216.06	5.22
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	looks appealing right now for long-term dividend  growth investors but I do think this could be a	221.28	4.44
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	bump a year ahead now shares of NSC are down a  little over 11 percent over the last year and	225.72	5.46
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	year to date for 2023 so far Shares are down 3.59  percent while the rest of the market has mostly	231.18	5.64
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	been going up their recent earnings report was  underwhelming despite record revenues Rising costs	236.82	5.1
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	are putting pressure on margins and guidance for  2023 has been lowered consider they are greatly	241.92	5.4
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	impacted by Fuel costs which have been at all-time  highs the cost of raw materials and the industry	247.32	5.4
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	has also been dealing with labor issues over  the last few years as inflation has put more	252.72	4.14
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	pressure on their Workforce there is certainly  some short-term headwinds but when you have a high	256.86	4.32
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	quality company like NSC the result in my opinion  is creating an intriguing long-term opportunity	261.18	5.16
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	shares of NSC are yielding 2.26 percent and this  is 20 above our five-year average which easily	266.34	5.64
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	meets the first criteria and I think if you can  get NSC above a two percent yield you are doing	271.98	4.62
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	pretty good NSC is trading in a forward price to  earnings of 17.2 and this is at a discount to its	276.6	5.7
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	five-year average of 18.2 so that checks off our  second criteria NSC is also trading cheaper than	282.3	5.64
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	the industrial sector as a whole at 18.3 norfolk's  other's dividend looks well covered as it makes up	287.94	5.52
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	39 percent of forward earnings and 51 percent of  Ford free cash flow Simply Save dividends assigns	293.46	5.28
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	a dividend safety score of 86 rated very safe  criteria 3 check and with the latest dividend	298.74	5.64
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	rates we now have seven years of dividend growth  and its five-year average annual dividend growth	304.38	4.26
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	rate is an impressive 15 this checks off our  last two criteria the Norfolk Southern pays its	308.64	6.18
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	quarterly cash dividend in the months of February  May August and November in the amount of a dollar	314.82	4.5
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	35 per share for a total annual payout of 5.40  you want to have your shares by February 2nd to	319.32	7.14
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	get that next dividend later in the month now  shares outstanding are on the decline over the	326.46	4.44
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	last decade Norfolk Southern appearing to have a  fairly aggressive Buy-Back program in 2013 there	330.9	5.04
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	were 316 million shares outstanding and today  there are 236 million that's a good chunk of	335.94	5.52
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	shares taken off the market which you'd love to  see the out the analyst average price Target is	341.46	5.16
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	about 250 dollars representing five percent upside  from current prices and I think February and going	346.62	5.52
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	forward for this year is going to be a good time  to buy stocks like NSC the recent dividend raise	352.14	4.56
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	looks promising for prospects going forward and I  think this is one that will be an opportunity for	356.7	4.38
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	a little while here which I like for dollar cost  averaging purposes company number two wek energy	361.08	5.28

7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	companies on the market take this claim for what  it's worth from their investor presentation but	394.8	4.44
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	apparently they have beat earnings 18 consecutive  years this earnings growth is impressive solid	399.24	6.24
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	this is a very solid dividend stock over the last  year shares of wec are down about two and a half	405.48	5.88

7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	3.36 percent which is 13 percent higher than  its five-year average yield this is just under	416.34	5.28
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	three percent checking off our first criteria  next the p e ratio is trading at 20.8 and this	421.62	6.9
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	is at a 10 discount to its five-year average of  23.2 making this a potentially good time to pick	428.52	6.24
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	up shares of wec hitting our second criteria the  dividend takes up 70 percent of forward earnings	434.76	6.54
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	for many Industries this would seem high but for  utilities it's actually on the Lower Side Simply	441.3	4.86
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	Safe dividends gives us a safety score of 87 very  safe and criteria 3 check and for a final two	446.16	6.84

7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	see in this graph each of these dips were great  times to add to a position in Pepsi and with the	882.96	4.32
7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	stock down more than five percent in 2023 I think  we may be heading into another one of those dips	887.28	4.44

7eDLR5Zocy4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eDLR5Zocy4	some of their funds available there I have a  small position that I'll be adding to slowly	933.24	4.32

bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	many people ask me that how do you	110.939	2.941
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	invest in the U.S stock markets what do	112.259	3.54

bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	will link some of my best and you can	115.799	3.841
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	check this out on an app called asbested	117.72	3.539
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	who are the sponsors of today's video	119.64	3.6

bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	consider using it so with that said let	126.0	3.899
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	us move on to the main video and there	127.979	3.661
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	are five simple points that I'm going to	129.899	3.661
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	discuss with you point number one is	131.64	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that why is it that adani stocks are	133.56	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	falling and there are wide set of	135.42	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	reasons for the same but the first	137.16	3.36
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	primary reason you will say that you	139.08	2.879
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	know what it is this is like such common	140.52	3.42
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	sense because Hindenburg came out with a	141.959	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	report and of course adani ji got hit it	143.94	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	was an allegation it hasn't been proven	146.459	3.541
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	in court yet but because of that	148.44	3.659
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	allegation adani stocks have fallen	150.0	4.319
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	quite aggressively yes and no no because	152.099	4.081
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	of the fact that tomorrow if I just come	154.319	3.601
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and if I start seeing some random stuff	156.18	3.419
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	about some organization does it mean	157.92	3.36
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that that organization stock will fall	159.599	3.42
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	or get crushed by billions of dollars	161.28	3.599
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the answer is no it doesn't work like	163.019	3.661
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that if there is no substance to	164.879	3.72
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	whatever has been said it is very	166.68	3.839
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	unlikely that the entire investment	168.599	4.261
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Community will start believing in that	170.519	4.621
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	narrative see everyone has an agenda but	172.86	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you need to give your consideration to	175.14	3.54
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the one who are proving their agenda	177.0	3.959
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	with facts and logic that is the simple	178.68	3.779
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	request that I have with you don't trust	180.959	3.121
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	whatever I am saying look at whatever	182.459	3.901
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	data and facts I am presenting so the	184.08	3.659
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	question is not about who is putting	186.36	3.06
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	allegation on whom and who is right who	187.739	3.901
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is not that all data will tell us but so	189.42	3.899
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	far the story is that Hindenburg came	191.64	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	out with a report they asked 88 set of	193.319	4.681
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	questions to adani group and adani group	195.84	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	has not answered one question as of now	198.0	3.72
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this is a general media statement that	199.92	3.3
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	they have given and if you go through it	201.72	2.82
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you will realize that they are just	203.22	2.7
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	talking in circles there is nothing	204.54	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	substantial in it on top of this atani	205.92	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	group has said that we are going to sue	208.2	4.44
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Hindenburg they said no problem right we	209.76	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	will deal with that we stand by whatever	212.64	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	we have said so these are the facts of	214.26	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the matter so far in a large section of	216.12	4.32
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	investment Community looking at the	218.64	3.72
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	story so far has started to trust the	220.44	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Hindenburg research more for example	222.36	3.959
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Bill Ackman is a very celebrated hedge	224.22	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	fund investor in the US he's a	226.319	4.021
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	billionaire and he also agrees to the	228.06	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	fact that Hindenburg report is well	230.34	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	researched sevi has started looking more	231.9	4.68
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	into it so as and when the Hindenburg	234.18	4.68
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	research gets more stamp of approval it	236.58	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	causes more pain for adani group so now	238.86	4.019
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	comes the second slightly more technical	241.08	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Finance oriented point which has got to	242.879	4.741
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	do with fpo so today on Friday when I'm	244.92	5.22
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	shooting this video 27th of January the	247.62	4.979
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	adani fpo was launched and there is a	250.14	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	period in which this subscription will	252.599	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	take place so very few people subscribed	254.22	4.019
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	to this fpo now you might ask me that	256.199	3.901
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	what exactly is fpo so I had made a	258.239	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	specific video on this FBO topic a month	260.1	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	back you can go and check it out the	262.079	3.421
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	link to that is in the description box	263.88	3.18
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and pinned comments so you'll get an	265.5	3.36
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	entire understanding but very quickly	267.06	3.24
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	explaining because many of you would not	268.86	3.36
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	watch that video so you have IPO right	270.3	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	so in IPO what happens is that if a	272.22	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	company for example zomato it was a	274.08	3.899
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	private company it launched its share on	275.88	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the public exchange then public can	277.979	3.601
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	start participating in it for example	279.9	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	before IPO of zomato was launched you	281.58	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and I could not have invested in that	284.04	3.96
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	but once zomato IPO then you and I as	285.36	4.8
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	normal basic retail investors we could	288.0	4.68
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	go and buy those stocks now in fpo what	290.16	4.319
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	happens is that a listed company for	292.68	3.54
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	example adaniji's companies have been	294.479	3.841
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	listed on stock exchange for several	296.22	3.539
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	number of years it's already a public	298.32	3.659
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	company two years ago also you could go	299.759	4.261
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and buy his stocks now also you can do	301.979	3.901
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the same so if such a company releases	304.02	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	more shares on the stock market that is	305.88	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	called as follow on public offer that is	307.8	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	all it means there are small small	309.78	3.06
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	differences again please go and watch	311.28	3.24
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the video you will understand it but	312.84	3.96
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	back to the topic at hand so this entire	314.52	6.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	fpo game or the expectation from the FPS	316.8	5.76
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	a lot of people are going to show	320.54	4.24
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	interest but unfortunately people are	322.56	4.079
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	not showing that level of Interest as of	324.78	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	now yes it is true that there are few	326.639	4.201
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	more days to go it is very likely that	328.8	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the entire issue will get subscribed no	330.84	4.199
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	doubt about that but the performance so	332.88	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	far has been very very lukewarm and not	335.039	4.141
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	good to say so this does not give good	337.38	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	indication to the market now on top of	339.18	4.019
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this there is a band price issue so let	341.4	3.299
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	me quickly explain that now you can	343.199	3.301
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	understand the FBI and band price from	344.699	3.481
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the simple example so consider for	346.5	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	example any adani stock let's say adani	348.18	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	green hypothetically it is trading at	350.1	4.8
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	100 rupees right now then fpo will be	351.84	5.04
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	lucrative if you are getting to buy that	354.9	4.799
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	at let's say 95 rupees otherwise	356.88	4.259
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you can just simply go and buy it today	359.699	4.081
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	only why would you wait for FPU but in	361.139	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this there is a band that has been	363.78	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	decided for example between 85 to 95	365.039	4.621
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	rupees you will get to buy adani green	367.38	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	stock if today it is getting at 100	369.66	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	rupees so that is what fpo issue roughly	371.52	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	means now what has happened is that	373.86	3.899
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	after today's stock market Fall that	375.6	4.92
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	some stocks have fallen by even 20 20 so	377.759	4.681
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you are anyways getting this for 80 then	380.52	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	why would you go and buy it in this	382.44	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	range so people hnis who have bid for it	384.12	4.98
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	are feeling a little bit bad so this fpo	386.52	4.26
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	entire issue is not going well for	389.1	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	adaniji as of now it is not as if that	390.78	3.96
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	it will not get fully subscribed it very	392.88	3.659
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	well might I don't know maybe maybe not	394.74	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	but people right now are feeling a	396.539	3.72
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	little bit jittery especially given the	398.4	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	fact that these stocks are hitting lower	400.259	3.541
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	circuit now now the third point is and	402.0	3.479
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this is a personal opinion that really	403.8	3.36

bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	analyzed every single number in it now	420.84	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	another narrative is being trying to	422.94	2.759
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	build that you know what anyone who	424.44	3.06
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	criticizes an Indian company is an	425.699	4.62
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	anti-national so I will not get into all	427.5	4.259
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this but the simple point that I'm	430.319	3.301
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	trying to tell you is that we are proud	431.759	3.181
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that Indians are building great	433.62	3.0
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	companies but it should be a clean	434.94	3.479
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	company that's a simple Point especially	436.62	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	when you and I as retail investors are	438.419	4.68
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	investing in those companies so anyways	441.0	4.259
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	moving on the fourth reason why adani	443.099	3.901
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	stocks are falling quite aggressively is	445.259	4.141

bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this is a very very big issue that can	449.4	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	blow up if situation does not improve	451.56	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	quite aggressively from this point so	453.78	3.419
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	how does it play out let me explain that	455.58	3.42
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	now if you go on adani groups company	457.199	3.301
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you will see this that pledged	459.0	3.0
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	percentage now what is the meaning of	460.5	3.36
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	pledge percentage pledge percentage	462.0	3.479
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	simply means that for example let's say	463.86	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	hypothetically that advani ji has 100	465.479	4.62
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	crores worth of Danny Green stocks now	467.34	6.12
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	he has pledged 4.36 crore worth of adani	470.099	6.121
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	green stocks to whom to Banks now why	473.46	4.859
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	has he placed it because he wanted more	476.22	4.259
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	money from the banks info form of loans	478.319	4.261
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	for example if you and I have a house	480.479	4.201
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and if we want a loan against that house	482.58	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	we can go to our bank and we can	484.68	4.32
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	mortgage that house what will the man do	486.78	3.359
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	bank will say that you know actually	489.0	3.419
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	take like two lakh rupees and now we own	490.139	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	your house papers and when you are able	492.419	4.68
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	to repay us come back to us repay us and	494.639	4.081
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	then it houses yours he'll give you your	497.099	3.0
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	papers back now something similar	498.72	3.599
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	happens in publicly listed company this	500.099	4.201
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is a common mechanism now is pledge	502.319	3.901
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	promoter holding good or bad well	504.3	3.899
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	generally speaking it is bad one should	506.22	3.72
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	not pledge they are companies holding	508.199	3.601
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	because it does not reflect well so this	509.94	4.26
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is one General consensus that is there a	511.8	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	more aggressive or a more Troublesome	514.2	3.839
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	point in adani group's case is that now	515.94	4.32
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	these stocks have corrected by Twenty	518.039	4.44
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	twenty percent now if a stock has	520.26	4.139
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	corrected by 20 what is going to happen	522.479	4.98
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	to this pledge for example this 4.36	524.399	5.401
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	crore what is the value that becomes it	527.459	5.521
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	will fall by 20 right but the loan that	529.8	4.8
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	has been taken against it let's say that	532.98	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	advani ji took like let's say five crore	534.6	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	rupee loan that still stays outstanding	536.64	5.22
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	in five crores right so the bank starts	539.1	4.44
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	to panic they think that you know what	541.86	4.68
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	today this has fallen by 20 the value of	543.54	6.12
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	my collateral has gone down by 20 and if	546.54	4.919
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	tomorrow again this stock Falls by 20	549.66	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	then my collateral value will again go	551.459	5.221
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	down by 20 so they start to panic the	553.68	4.8
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	bankers do not have that type of vision	556.68	3.719
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that you know what okay as a promoter I	558.48	3.539
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	am willing to hold my company for 20	560.399	3.241
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	years I am a long-term player this that	562.019	3.541
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	no banks do not have that Vision their	563.64	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	simple goal is we have lent you money we	565.56	3.779
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	want to be reasonably sure that we will	567.42	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	get our money back if tomorrow the risk	569.339	3.661
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	assessment team of the rank management	571.56	3.42
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	tells them that you know what the market	573.0	4.62
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is such that we are not going to get our	574.98	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	money back what are they going to do	577.62	3.18
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	they will start selling these stocks and	578.88	4.139
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	it becomes a big big problem for the	580.8	4.86
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	company that has pledged now if Bank a	583.019	4.921
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	sells some part of their pledge promoter	585.66	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	holding stocks then what do you think	587.94	3.3
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Bank B is going to do they are going to	589.5	3.839
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	do exactly the same then what do you	591.24	3.659
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	think Bank C is going to do they are	593.339	3.601
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	going to do exactly the same if three	594.899	3.481
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	banks are doing it what do you think	596.94	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	other big fiis day is are going to do	598.38	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	they are going to do exactly the same so	600.6	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this is how Panic happens in the market	602.58	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	now unfortunate part is that today's	604.26	4.68
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	aggressive fault indicates that some big	606.36	4.56
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	investor has sold their holding now this	608.94	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	data is very hard to get that who	610.92	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	exactly has sold but let me show you the	612.72	3.96
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	volume figure and you will understand a	614.94	3.12
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	little bit of story there now this is	616.68	3.659
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the adani green energy Limited stock and	618.06	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	what you will see is that this was	620.339	3.301
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	literally a free fall a lot of selling	621.54	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	has happened but look at the volume with	623.64	4.44
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	which this selling has come now small	625.74	4.44
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	retail investors it is highly unlikely	628.08	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that they will be able to generate such	630.18	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	a large volume so therefore it indicates	631.92	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that some big player might have sold	634.08	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this now who is that big player we don't	636.0	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	know data will come out subsequently but	637.68	3.54
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this is where we are heading in terms of	639.6	3.12
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	volume now in case you want to learn	641.22	3.299
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	volume chain analysis you want to learn	642.72	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	macro style of investing you want to	644.519	3.421
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	learn technical style of investing so I	646.2	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	teach that on my course on stock markets	647.94	3.36
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you can go and check it out there is a	649.68	2.94
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	very helpful community that we have	651.3	3.06
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	built now moving on to the second point	652.62	3.899
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that what will be the impact of adani	654.36	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	groups fall on the entire Indian stock	656.519	4.681
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	market so well today the Indian stock	658.74	4.86
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	market or nifty 50 so to say fell by	661.2	4.92
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	roughly 1.61 and adani stocks on an	663.6	4.799
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	average fell by 15 16 at least so even	666.12	4.68
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	like 20 on some stocks so there is a	668.399	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	huge discrepancy here had it been the	670.8	4.32
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	case that the Nifty has fallen by 10 and	672.899	4.921
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	adani stocks have fallen by 15 20 okay	675.12	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that would have made sense that adani is	677.82	3.36
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	having a lot of impact on the Indian	679.62	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Equity Market but as of now it looks to	681.18	4.86
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	be an okay situation now one of the key	683.76	4.019
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	things that is preventing this fall is	686.04	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that right now people believe that	687.779	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Indian banks have limited exposure to	689.88	4.74
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	adani debt so even if you assume the	692.279	4.021
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	worst that you know CB comes	694.62	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	investigates all fair investigation is	696.3	4.74
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	done something deep murky comes out all	698.76	4.259
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that stuff adani's default on Bank State	701.04	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the consideration is that banks are	703.019	4.081
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	going to handle it this is the key thing	705.12	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that is preventing the Indian stock	707.1	3.299
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	market right now and this piece of	708.6	3.479
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	analysis is very difficult to do so	710.399	3.18
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	there is no point in me getting into the	712.079	3.241
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	numbers but let me show you some data	713.579	3.721
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	here so first and foremost if you take a	715.32	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	look at this article what you will see	717.3	4.86
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is that as per clsa it is said that the	719.1	5.34
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	bank funding in overall adani group debt	722.16	4.919
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is less than 40 percent and who owns	724.44	4.32
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	majority of the debt it is the foreign	727.079	3.541
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Banks it is the financial institution	728.76	4.199
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and a large part of global debt Market	730.62	5.04
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	owns adani debt okay so that is sensible	732.959	4.56
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	but here is an entire counter argument	735.66	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	to that story now when bad loan problem	737.519	4.44
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	happens in Bank what it leads to is	739.8	3.96
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	something called as domino effect so	741.959	3.421
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Domino Falls something like this so I'll	743.76	3.24
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	put our image here and you will be able	745.38	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	to understand it so usually what happens	747.0	3.779
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is that let's say that that bank a has	748.86	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	two percent bad debt problem with adani	750.779	4.081
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	group now adani group defaults then this	752.76	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	bank is going to lose this two percent	754.86	3.719
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	of money now the thing is that this bank	756.36	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	will lose some of its valuation so today	758.579	4.021
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	a lot of banks lost their valuation now	760.44	4.079
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	in case more funds default for example	762.6	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	adani is linked to some other firm that	764.519	3.301
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	defaults then third form fourth form	766.26	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Swift sum they default so this exposure	767.82	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is not just two percent this might go up	770.04	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	to five to seven or even 10 20 of the	771.72	4.26
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	debt in that event this Bank might	773.94	4.56
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	entirely go under now because Banks	775.98	4.74
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	interlined to each other inter Landing	778.5	4.44
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	means that ICICI gives money to HDFC	780.72	4.559
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	HDFC gives money to kotec Mahindra Banks	782.94	4.44
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	so on and so forth a lot of bank can get	785.279	3.961
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	exposed to this Domino now this is	787.38	4.019
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	something similar that happened in 2008	789.24	4.56
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	also that is where domino effect was	791.399	5.101
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	exhibited and not only the U.S banks got	793.8	4.56
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	crash a lot of banks in India got	796.5	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	crushed as well because of that U.S	798.36	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Centric problem so the point is that the	800.16	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	entire global banking structure so to	802.44	3.899
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	say especially between India and the US	804.3	4.86
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that works in conjunction so this is a	806.339	4.62
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	deeply worrying sign I can't extract	809.16	3.479
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that data and tell you that what is the	810.959	3.481
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	probability of this happening but please	812.639	3.421
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	keep in mind that there is a probability	814.44	3.36
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that this can happen and that is	816.06	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	precisely the reason why the banking	817.8	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	stocks today fell quite aggressively now	819.72	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	on top of this what is likely to happen	821.88	3.24
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is that there are large institutional	823.5	4.079
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	investors for example LIC has its entire	825.12	4.68
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	seven percent of its Equity portfolio in	827.579	4.26
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	adani stocks now why have they purchased	829.8	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	so much of adani stocks I have no clue	831.839	4.321
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	but to cut the long story short if even	833.88	4.74
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	One Bank gets stressed due to the adani	836.16	4.26
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	loan problem it is is very likely that	838.62	3.839
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	their series of banks are going to sell	840.42	4.32
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the adani stocks because they own a lot	842.459	4.141
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	of pledged stocks and even if One Bank	844.74	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	gets into trouble that can just escalate	846.6	4.32
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the domino effect reaching all the way	849.12	3.899
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	up to LIC where it might be forced to	850.92	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	sell and Salvage whatever it can get now	853.019	4.56
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this is how bad the situation can get so	855.3	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	now comes the next point that How likely	857.579	4.56
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is this situation now this is a little	859.5	4.44
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	bit complicated topic to discuss because	862.139	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	we are doing scenario analysis so I will	863.94	4.26
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	try to present a very neutral Viewpoint	866.279	4.201
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	see up until Thursday I was of the view	868.2	4.439
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that it is very very unlikely that large	870.48	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	institutional investors are going to	872.639	4.681
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	sell adani stocks why was that the case	874.62	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	simply because of the Viewpoint that	877.32	3.72
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	adani group itself has a lot of holding	879.0	4.62
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	they control almost 75 of the stocks	881.04	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	again please go and watch my previous	883.62	3.12
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	video on this topic you will understand	885.06	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that so that is promoter holding then as	886.74	3.899
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	per the allegations there are shell	889.26	3.72
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	companies so they also hold it then on	890.639	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	top of that LIC is unlikely to sell with	892.98	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	any stocks and on top of that even banks	894.779	4.021
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	are going to suffer if they decide to	897.12	4.32
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	sell their pledge promoter holding so I	898.8	4.26
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	was of the view that no Institutional	901.44	3.18
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Investor is going to sell but	903.06	3.24
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	unfortunately on Friday two major	904.62	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	changes happened Point number one is	906.3	3.779
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that Sadie came and it said that they	908.22	3.239
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	are going to look into hinderberg report	910.079	3.12
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	now this is not an approval of the	911.459	3.661
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Hindenburg report and on the flip side	913.199	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this is not a denial but the investor	915.12	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Community or a big part of investor	917.279	3.961
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Community has taken it as a Viewpoint	919.32	3.959
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that this is a stamp of approval which	921.24	3.719
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	has caused mass panic and some big	923.279	4.381
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	investor has sold adani stocks this is	924.959	4.861
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	really big and worrying news that has	927.66	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	played out now I don't know who	929.82	3.12
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	specifically has sold it I will keep you	931.26	4.319
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	posted on this but with the volumes that	932.94	5.1
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	adani stocks have been sold at despite	935.579	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the fpo getting launched where the group	938.04	3.599
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	must have pushed their institutional	940.079	3.661
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	buyers to stabilize the stock even if	941.639	3.421
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the situation is not getting under	943.74	3.599
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	control it indicates something deep now	945.06	3.779
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	just for understanding three things	947.339	2.94
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	could have played out that number one	948.839	3.18
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	status queue would have been maintained	950.279	4.86
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	status right nothing is changing just	952.019	4.68
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	keep it the way it is functioning and	955.139	3.0
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	response to here would have been that	956.699	2.401
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you know adani ji is saying something	958.139	2.88
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	thing answering questions and hinderberg	959.1	3.12
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is saying something and answering	961.019	2.82
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	questions none of the external parties	962.22	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	are involved now unfortunately what has	963.839	3.781
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	happened is that Savi has said that we	965.82	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	are going to look into it now I don't	967.62	3.3
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	know whether we can categorize that as	969.42	3.359
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	investigation what specific terminology	970.92	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	we can use now politicians might drum up	972.779	4.381
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	all that stuff will be there so if we	975.06	4.44
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	reach this stage this leads to a period	977.16	5.76
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	of uncertainty and stock markets hate	979.5	5.459
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	uncertainty the moment there is	982.92	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	uncertainty there is wide Panic that	984.959	3.901
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	happens that has happened all the times	987.12	3.959
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	because there is people's money at stake	988.86	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	so people just hit uncertainty about	991.079	3.961
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	their money they get deeply worried if	993.06	3.839
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	it reaches to an investigation stage	995.04	3.539
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	which is where this case might actually	996.899	3.781
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	get headed unless of course adani group	998.579	4.26
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	comes out give clarification on those 88	1000.68	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	points the investor Community starts to	1002.839	4.201
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	believe in it and the frenzy dies down	1005.06	4.139
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	so I really hope that that happens now	1007.04	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	in case if that is not happening or if	1009.199	4.26
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the answers are not satisfactory then at	1011.18	3.719
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	some stage stamping will happen so	1013.459	3.06
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	stamping means he can't say yeah who is	1014.899	3.661
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	right who is wrong all that stuff so who	1016.519	4.141
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	would do this camping well whoever does	1018.56	5.519
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	it subsequently in 2024 2025 2028 we	1020.66	5.279
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	don't know but there will be a massive	1024.079	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	period of uncertainty that will happen	1025.939	3.961
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and that will just crush the stock and	1027.679	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	specially given the fact around the	1029.9	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	pledged promoter holding thing that	1031.579	4.021
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Banks own a lot of adani group stocks	1033.38	5.28
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and if the collateral value Falls some	1035.6	5.219
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	big players are going to start selling	1038.66	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	it and that is how you see stocks	1040.819	4.62
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	getting crashed by 80 80 also can that	1042.86	4.8
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	happen on adani ji's case I think now it	1045.439	3.961
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	predominantly hinges on what the	1047.66	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	response to those 88 questions will be I	1049.4	4.26
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	think they must be preparing this at the	1052.04	3.3
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	back end so let's just wait and watch	1053.66	4.019
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and see what happens but till that point	1055.34	4.5
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	those 88 questions are not answered it	1057.679	4.321
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	becomes a very bad talking point now I	1059.84	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	know a lot of you might be thinking that	1062.0	3.24
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you know what this is like an operator's	1063.5	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	game because operators might be selling	1065.24	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	it they will buy it at lower prices they	1066.98	4.199
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	will make a lot of money well that is	1069.26	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	true that that type of stuff happens it	1071.179	4.201
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	might be happening in this case also but	1073.16	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	it cannot happen at such a large scale	1075.38	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	it is highly unlikely that a lot of	1077.24	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Institutional Investor especially on a	1078.98	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	stock that is driven by a lot of debt	1081.26	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	because adaniji has a lot of debt I	1083.12	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	don't think that that level of game	1085.16	3.18
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	would be played out especially given the	1086.72	4.079
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	fact that not too many fiis and dies own	1088.34	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this stock so now comes the next point	1090.799	2.941
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that what is it that you should be doing	1092.24	3.54
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	if you are an investor in the adani	1093.74	3.36
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	group of companies right now well	1095.78	3.18
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	honestly I've been making videos for the	1097.1	3.959
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	last several months almost it has been	1098.96	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	like six seven months that I have spoken	1101.059	3.421
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	about the group that please do not buy	1102.62	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	deeply leveraged assets deeply leverage	1104.48	4.28
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	things means that	1107.0	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and you know we are going to borrow	1108.76	4.419
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	crazy amount of money become a monopoly	1110.66	4.379
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	these type of businesses are not good	1113.179	3.661
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	even if they are giving crazy amount of	1115.039	3.661
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	money you are just taking too much risk	1116.84	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	with your money that you should not be	1118.7	3.479
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	taking risk if you are going in some	1120.62	3.179
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	other asset class for example if you go	1122.179	3.481
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and buy cryptos if you go and buy	1123.799	4.201
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	undeveloped land if you go and buy like	1125.66	4.2
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	some kind of Farmland you know that	1128.0	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you're taking risk there but in the	1129.86	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	stock market so unless you're going and	1131.6	3.42
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	buying a small cap company that can give	1133.46	3.839
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	crazy returns that makes sense but why	1135.02	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	would you go and buy a large cap company	1137.299	3.961
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	that is so heavily leveraged so again	1138.86	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	I'm not saying that you know what this	1141.26	3.06
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	was a right move wrong move but honestly	1142.7	3.599
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	I can't say anything I hope whatever I	1144.32	3.359
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	have discussed so far it will give you	1146.299	3.421
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Clarity and you might make a call but I	1147.679	3.601
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	will not give any call here for any	1149.72	3.36
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	recommendation to buy or sell now comes	1151.28	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the second point for investors for whom	1153.08	3.3
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this video was made that if you're	1154.94	2.82
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	worried that you know what I have zero	1156.38	2.94
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	exposure to adani stocks of very little	1157.76	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	exposure but I am generally invested in	1159.32	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the Indian stock market should I panic	1161.6	3.66
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	short answer is no you should not panic	1163.34	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	there can be a period of pain maybe six	1165.26	3.779
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	eight ten months 12 months whatever it	1167.48	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is please do not sell anything these are	1169.039	3.781
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	not the type of markets where you should	1171.26	3.36
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	monitor your portfolio what is happening	1172.82	3.06
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	what is not happening how much money	1174.62	3.299
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	have I lost today please don't worry	1175.88	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	about it if the stock market has fallen	1177.919	3.601
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	by two percent in a day it can easily go	1179.66	3.84
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	up to even four or five percent rise in	1181.52	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the overall scenario so pick good stocks	1183.5	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	right now what good stocks are I will	1185.9	3.0
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	discuss some of these stocks on	1187.64	3.12
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	tomorrow's member Community posts so you	1188.9	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	could consider joining it but to cut the	1190.76	3.419
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	long story short please do not panic	1192.5	3.299
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	sell anything that you have please don't	1194.179	4.141
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	stop your sips please don't do any of	1195.799	4.62
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	this stuff it is very very difficult to	1198.32	4.32
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	time if you go away from the market you	1200.419	3.961
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	will not be able to time when you should	1202.64	4.08
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	be entering the market so just stay put	1204.38	4.26
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	stop checking your portfolio that is the	1206.72	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	simple piece of advice that I will give	1208.64	3.539
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you so now comes the fifth point that is	1210.2	3.96
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	there any Ray of Hope how this situation	1212.179	3.721
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	can be quickly turned around so number	1214.16	3.72
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	one is the budget announcement if the	1215.9	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	government controls the sentiments or	1217.88	3.179
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	manages the sentiment so to say by	1219.38	3.48
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	introducing a good budget that people	1221.059	3.841
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	are generally happy about then that can	1222.86	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	create into a positive effect for the	1224.9	4.38
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	entire market for adani group I don't	1227.0	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	know but that can definitely translate	1229.28	3.96
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	into good optimism for the entire market	1231.02	4.14
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	and I get a sense that this is likely to	1233.24	3.54
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	happen but since I can't back it up with	1235.16	3.3
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	data please disregard that that is just	1236.78	3.3
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	my personal Viewpoint telling it you	1238.46	3.3
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	very categorically the second key thing	1240.08	4.02
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	is that 85 88 questions that Hindenburg	1241.76	4.74
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	has asked if a response is generated	1244.1	5.34
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	Swift if good response is presented if	1246.5	5.039
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	the data is categorically refuted that	1249.44	3.78
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	will instill a lot of investor	1251.539	3.721
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	confidence I don't know if they plan on	1253.22	3.72
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	doing it if they want to fight the case	1255.26	3.96
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	legally whatever it is but if the case	1256.94	4.44
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	gets dragged down in quotes then we are	1259.22	3.72
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	looking at a massive correction in the	1261.38	3.6
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	stock so this is where I'll stop I hope	1262.94	3.9
bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you enjoyed this conversation do let me	1264.98	3.18

bbj209aCanY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbj209aCanY	you the next time	1269.78	2.6

HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	there are basically two questions that	2.46	3.24
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	are going on in the market right now	4.14	3.719
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	first question is that is this a good	5.7	4.319
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	time to buy and the second question is	7.859	3.961
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that if indeed it is a good time to buy	10.019	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	then what type of stocks we should be	11.82	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	looking at because so many stocks have	13.559	4.021
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	corrected so on this video I'm going to	15.36	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	discuss with you five specific stocks	17.58	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that are traditionally considered to be	19.98	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	very good stocks they are available at a	22.08	3.779
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	good price right now whether you should	24.06	3.299
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	be buying it whether you should not be	25.859	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	buying it that decision is up to you I	27.359	4.621
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	will simply present my analysis out of	29.939	4.261
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	this through my tone the way I speak you	31.98	3.84
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	will get to understand which stocks I am	34.2	3.6
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	bullish about which stocks I'm bearish	35.82	3.78
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	about so let us discuss both these	37.8	3.599
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	points and first and foremost let me	39.6	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	present a very quick commentary as to	41.399	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	whether I think the markets are	43.14	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	overvalued right now and whether it's a	45.059	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	good time to enter the market or not so	47.34	3.48
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	here is a very quick technical	49.559	3.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	commentary and what we are considering	50.82	4.259
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	here is nifty 50 which represents the	52.739	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	overall Market sentiment in the top 50	55.079	4.441
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	stocks in India and we are considering	57.059	4.621
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	one month candle here so every candle	59.52	3.719
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that you see for example this this	61.68	3.659
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	indicates the stock market performance	63.239	5.341
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	of 50 50 over a period of one month so	65.339	5.041
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	what you will notice are two three very	68.58	3.48
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	important points so the first thing that	70.38	3.3
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you will notice is that the market is	72.06	4.14
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	now making higher lows for example you	73.68	4.439
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	will see that the market fell here it	76.2	4.38
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	made a low here at point one then it	78.119	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Rose all the way till here it fell right	80.58	4.02
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	so the second low was here then it rose	82.439	4.141
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	again it fell it made lower low here	84.6	4.559
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	then it made higher low here so this one	86.58	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	two three point it is getting formed in	89.159	3.901
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	this ladder manner which is an ascending	91.2	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	ladder so to see so very likely that the	93.06	4.019
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	fourth step on this ladder will get	95.28	3.659
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	formed somewhere here then here and it	97.079	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	will go like this so this is what the	98.939	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	technicals tell us this is the first	101.159	2.64
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	critical point that you must remember	102.479	3.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	second there is a very interesting	103.799	3.541
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	pattern that you can see and this is	105.659	4.14
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	called as doji pattern doji pattern so	107.34	5.04
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	what this indicates is that when the	109.799	4.621
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	market is actually falling so the market	112.38	3.779
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	has been falling from here all the way	114.42	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	till here and then a doji was formed	116.159	4.381
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	what does this indicate this indicates	118.32	5.04
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	indecisiveness in the market so at this	120.54	5.399
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	point this point I will name as 0.1 here	123.36	5.039
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the market was indecisive and next month	125.939	4.981
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the market gave an up move so the market	128.399	4.501
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	has right now decided that it is going	130.92	3.78
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	to give an upper move which is positive	132.9	3.419
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	news so in case you are building	134.7	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	positions then even from a midterm to	136.319	4.56
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	short-term perspective also it looks	138.78	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	like that the market is in an uptrend	140.879	3.481
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	now you will say that okay akshat now	142.86	3.06

HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	coming back to the topic I hope the	177.78	3.959
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	technical are clear now very quickly	179.519	4.141
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	commenting on the macros so very	181.739	3.241
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	recently you would have heard that the	183.66	3.719
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	banking crisis was there that to a very	184.98	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	large extent has been solved at least it	187.379	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	has been absorbed in the market number	189.18	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	two inflation had already peaked now	191.099	4.56
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	inflation is coming back to that	193.62	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	somewhat controllable level as per the	195.659	4.021
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	governments this is second key point	197.94	3.299
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	it's an entirely different debate we'll	199.68	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	have it some other time but this is what	201.239	3.301
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the macros are telling us third key	203.04	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	point about the interest rate you would	204.54	4.68
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	have recently read the news that RBI has	206.58	4.98
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	stopped the hiking of the interest rate	209.22	4.68
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	they have paused it at six point five	211.56	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	percent the expectation was that it	213.9	5.22
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	would go to 6.75 it did not happen so	216.06	4.92
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	what does that indicate it indicates	219.12	4.38
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that even interest rates have been so	220.98	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	these are all telltale signs that going	223.5	4.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	forward in the market the worst case the	225.48	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	markets are going to stay sideways and	227.76	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	best cased more liquidity will be put in	229.68	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the market Maybe by decreasing the	232.08	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	interest rate and if that happens the	234.12	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	markets will rally like anything so this	235.98	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	is my overall macro commentary so to cut	238.2	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the long story short good time to invest	240.18	3.419
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	in the stock market definitely yes	241.86	3.42
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	please do not simply sit on the	243.599	3.78
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	sidelines watch the show and you know	245.28	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	then the stock market will start running	247.379	3.78
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	and you will not be able to buy it so	249.0	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	let me give you an example and please be	251.159	3.841
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	very very honest with me think about it	253.08	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	this way that when Monday Market opens	255.0	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	and if it goes up by one and a half two	257.28	3.959
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	percent in a day which can definitely	259.44	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	happen then would you have the courage	261.239	4.261
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	to invest in the markets then most of us	263.34	4.4
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	would not we will think yeah	265.5	5.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	I'll probably wait then I will see	267.74	5.98
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	then I will buy it then the day after it	270.86	4.119
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	again goes up by like one one and a half	273.72	2.82
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	percent or whatever right then again you	274.979	4.081
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	will keep on waiting so this timing the	276.54	4.379
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	market in the short term it never works	279.06	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	and therefore in the short term you	280.919	3.541
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	should not try to time the market it's a	282.6	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	very bad strategy even the best of the	284.46	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	investors are not able to do it so my	286.56	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	suggestion would be that study the	288.78	3.3
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	market and if you feel comfortable and	290.28	3.12
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	if you're confident about your stock	292.08	3.48
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	picks definitely do consider investing	293.4	4.14
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	some money we are very close to a bull	295.56	3.78
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	run or maybe we are already in a bull	297.54	3.78
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	run so with that out of the way let me	299.34	4.079

HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	very recently and the results were not	314.16	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	very encouraging even the management	316.08	4.5

HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	looks confused U.S banking crisis	395.759	4.261
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	happened so many problems have been	397.919	4.321
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	there and it directly or indirectly	400.02	4.799
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	impacts the Indian I.T industry so no	402.24	4.14
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	doubt about that that from a macro	404.819	3.481
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	perspective this is not a healthy sign	406.38	4.319
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	for Indian I.T industry this is 0.1	408.3	4.679
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Point number two you need to study the	410.699	4.261
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	deeper reason for the fall of Infosys	412.979	3.361
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	stock so let me first show you the chart	414.96	3.239
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	very quickly so what you will see is	416.34	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that from the top infosystem block has	418.199	4.681
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	corrected by roughly 26 27 percent so	420.3	4.739
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	this is a substantial dip in a way but	422.88	3.599
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the point that you need to remember is	425.039	4.021
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that if you study the pre-covered prices	426.479	5.521
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you will see that the rise on Infosys	429.06	6.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	stock price is still roughly 75 percent	432.0	6.0
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	so this is not a very low ISO to say	435.24	4.92
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that over the last three years Infosys	438.0	4.8
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	stock has gone up by 75 percent so just	440.16	4.92
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	because it has fallen by 26 percent does	442.8	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	not mean that Infosys is an undervalued	445.08	4.14
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	stock as of now so this is the second	447.3	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	key point that you should know now the	449.22	2.819
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	third key point that you should	450.96	2.76
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	understand is that you should study the	452.039	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	U.S tech market and U.S banking Market	453.72	4.74
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	because these are the primary clients of	455.759	5.461
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Infosys or companies like Infosys they	458.46	4.739
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	give a lot of back-end work to Indian	461.22	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	I.T companies and these Indian ID	463.199	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies export a lot of services to	465.3	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the US therefore you end up seeing	467.639	4.141
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	charts like this where Infosys right now	469.38	4.74
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	makes almost 70 75 percent of its money	471.78	5.22
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	by exporting services to the US so	474.12	4.979
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	expanding upon this point three what has	477.0	4.139
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	happened there basically consolidating	479.099	4.38
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	their capacity as of now they are not	481.139	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	looking to hire people too aggressively	483.479	4.321
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	they are figuring out what to do next so	485.099	4.621
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	in simple terms this is a consolidation	487.8	4.56
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	phase in the U.S tech industry what is	489.72	4.02
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	going to happen or what is rather	492.36	3.179
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	happening during this time in the USS	493.74	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the companies are going to decide that	495.539	3.78
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	where is this next layer of growth that	497.46	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	is going to come for us for example if	499.319	4.681
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you go back three four years back a lot	501.78	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	of companies were focusing on cloud	504.0	4.02
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	storage so Cloud was probably the	505.74	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	biggest area that every big company was	508.02	4.079
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	looking at now what is the narrative	510.36	3.78
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	they are looking at Ai and this is the	512.099	4.081
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	statement from CEO of Infosys this is a	514.14	3.839
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	very recent statement that even Infosys	516.18	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	is going to focus on AI and developing	517.979	5.341
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	AI capabilities so here is a very quick	520.38	4.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	flowchart and it will help you	523.32	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	understand Infosys business model in a	524.64	4.319
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	slightly more nuanced manner so this is	527.04	3.6
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	what it would look like so basically	528.959	3.601
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	when it comes to Big Banks and big tech	530.64	4.02
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies in the US what they do is that	532.56	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	they decide on a focus area first for	534.66	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	example it could be cloud computing or	537.18	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	it could be cloud-based storage or AWS	539.1	4.739
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	system that Amazon generally uses and	541.62	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	now you might have figured out that	543.839	3.0
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Amazon is actually making more money	545.16	4.38
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	from its AWS compared to its retail	546.839	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	segment right so all these things are	549.54	3.84
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	there that one Focus area is decided	551.279	4.141
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	whichever is a booming area during that	553.38	4.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	time all the U.S tech companies or at	555.42	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	least a large chunk of them jump onto	557.64	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	developing their expertise and then	559.5	3.6
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	final step is that they try to scale	561.3	3.719
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	this is where these back-end tech	563.1	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies like PCS Infosys come into the	565.019	4.921
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	equation that they help these companies	567.54	4.799
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	scale their areas of expertise very very	569.94	4.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	quickly so this is the simple equation	572.339	4.021
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	and this leads to a start and stop	574.2	4.259
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	effect in the technology segment now	576.36	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	what is the meaning of that the easiest	578.459	3.661
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	representation of that would be that you	580.08	4.199
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	go and study the pricing history or	582.12	4.56
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	stock price history of Infosys itself so	584.279	3.901
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you will get an idea so let me take you	586.68	3.42
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	through that so let us study the pricing	588.18	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	history from 2014 onwards so this is	590.1	4.38
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	like December of 2014 the stock was at	592.26	5.88
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	580 590 and all the way from 2014 to	594.48	6.12
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	March or April of 20 18 so four years	598.14	5.22
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	zero percent return on Infosys then it	600.6	4.919
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	gave a run up all the way till here then	603.36	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	it again stagnated for how many years if	605.519	3.721
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you compute then it roughly stagnated	607.44	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	for two years then what happened in this	609.24	3.659
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	final leg so this was a rally and this	611.16	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	was again a consolidation phase this was	612.899	3.481
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	a consolidation phase this was a	614.7	3.84
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	consolidation phase the point I'm trying	616.38	4.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	to drive home is very simple that there	618.54	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	is something called as start and stop	620.64	4.259
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that happens with the Indian I.T sector	622.44	4.079
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	why does that happen it's very very	624.899	3.901
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	simple because when some big tech	626.519	4.861
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	company in the US it tries to scale the	628.8	4.92
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	technology on which it is focusing that	631.38	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	is when the Indian ID companies make the	633.72	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	most money so that is the simple	635.82	3.6
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	equation and therefore I'd see very	637.38	4.139
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	limited point in taking or building huge	639.42	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	positions in individual I.T stocks in	641.519	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	India all that according to me is a very	643.74	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	very highly risky strategy and you know	645.839	4.021
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	people who have been watching me for the	647.7	3.6
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	last one and a half two years I have	649.86	3.3
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Simply Built my position on U.S tech	651.3	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	stocks whatever Tech investing I had to	653.16	3.78
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	do I had spread it on the U.S tech	655.2	4.199
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	stocks only I purchased TCS and Zuma	656.94	4.079
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	matter so zomato is something that I	659.399	4.141
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	still hold TCS I sold and whatever new	661.019	4.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	positions I have built I have built it	663.54	3.78
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	on Nifty it now you might have a very	665.279	3.901
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	natural question that okay that if	667.32	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you're not a believer in Indian I.T	669.18	3.659
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies why are you building positions	670.86	4.38
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	in Nifty it so okay so let me quickly	672.839	4.141
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	clarify that so there are two reasons	675.24	3.659
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	number one is that we don't know to what	676.98	4.68
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	extent these specific Technologies are	678.899	4.741
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	on the Innovation curve that is this	681.66	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	mature enough or are large scale	683.64	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Solutions will be built around it and	685.86	3.419
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies are going to benefit from it	687.54	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	we don't know at what stage of maturity	689.279	4.68
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	these different things are it might very	691.44	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	well happen that cloud still turns out	693.959	3.12
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	to be the number one money making	695.76	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	machine for something like Amazon even	697.079	3.541
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	in the next five years we cannot say	699.12	3.839
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	right or it might happen that AI might	700.62	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	gain more prominence now we don't know	702.959	5.401
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	if Infosys TCS emphasis or which company	705.24	5.339
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	will try to develop their expertise here	708.36	3.84
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	right so this is the first key reason	710.579	3.961
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that I do not know the second key area	712.2	4.74
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	has to do with regulations now almost	714.54	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	all the Indian it firms they export	716.94	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	their Services abroad we can't be sure	719.16	3.799
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Infosys	721.56	3.959
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	TCS only will win contract or emphasis	722.959	4.241
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	will only win contract we cannot say	725.519	3.361
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that so therefore according to me	727.2	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	diversifying your bed is a much better	728.88	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	strategy than picking concentrated bed	730.92	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	on the Indian ID sector so that brings	733.2	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	us to the final question about Infosys	735.42	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	key Indian ID stocks why do you want to	737.1	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	even touch the Indian ID stocks can't	739.62	3.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you just do away with them and invest	741.18	3.719
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	only in Banks or whatever yes that's a	742.8	4.14
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	very valid argument but see think about	744.899	3.781
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	this and and please do not bring the	746.94	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	nationalistic sentiment into play think	748.68	3.839
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	about it rationally that at the back end	750.3	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you need some players to support the	752.519	4.201
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	front-end technology drivers so here	754.74	3.839
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Amazon Google Netflix all these	756.72	3.359
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies which are like leading the	758.579	3.721
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	pack when it comes to technology and at	760.079	3.721
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the back end we need someone to drive	762.3	3.42
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that engine so that engine will	763.8	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	definitely be I.T companies so therefore	765.72	4.02
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	it makes sense to buy and build your	767.76	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	positions in Indian ID stocks no doubt	769.74	4.14
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	about that I don't know which individual	772.2	3.24
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies are going to win but Indian	773.88	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	I.T industry is definitely going to do	775.44	3.98
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	well and in fact if you study the	777.54	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	fundamentals that fundamentally has	779.42	3.94
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	something gone wrong with the Indian ID	781.62	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	industry so take for example Infosys	783.36	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	only so here you will see that it has an	785.82	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	roic or return on invested Capital which	787.8	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	is close to 30.4 percent and this is the	790.26	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	last five year average so the return	792.42	3.539
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that they make by investing 100 rupees	793.92	3.3
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	they are able to make 30 rupees	795.959	3.06
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	additional return on it which is very	797.22	3.119
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	good so they are not a capital	799.019	4.141
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	destruction firm on top of this they sit	800.339	5.641
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	on massive amount of cash flows this is	803.16	4.859
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	true for almost every tech company that	805.98	4.74
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	they are not primarily debt driven they	808.019	4.741
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	have a lot of asset light infrastructure	810.72	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	in place so therefore with this entire	812.76	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	cash flow they are able to manage the	814.92	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	situation and this allows them to stay	816.72	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	light even if they are not making crazy	819.24	3.42
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	returns for four or five years they are	820.8	4.14
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	able to survive the situation you as a	822.66	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	retail person will make a loss by	824.94	3.06
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	investing in these companies if you're	826.62	3.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	not patient enough if your Viewpoint is	828.0	4.38
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	and I should sell it off in another four	829.88	3.88
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	or five months or one year or two year	832.38	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	then you will not make any money and if	833.76	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that is the perspective with which you	835.92	3.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	are operating then please stay away from	837.42	3.659
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	this now very quickly let us move to	839.1	3.6
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	stock number two which is called as	841.079	3.481
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	gland Pharma so let me first and	842.7	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	foremost show you the price history of	844.56	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	gland Pharma and you will laugh at it by	846.24	3.599
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	looking at this graph that the stock has	847.92	4.8
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	corrected by roughly 75 so it has proven	849.839	4.68
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	to be a wealthy destructive stock you	852.72	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	will obviously fundamental problem so	854.519	4.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	let me very quickly take you through the	857.22	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	fundamentals so this is a zero debt	858.779	4.321
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	company what about profit is it making	860.94	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	profit increasing its sales yes it has	863.1	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	been growing like crazy even profits are	865.38	4.259
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	coming in no problem there what about	867.72	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	like fiidi investing are they selling	869.639	4.081
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	off their stake in gland Pharma and	872.04	3.539
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	moving away the answer is no in fact	873.72	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	they have increased their holding over	875.579	3.601
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the last three years so then comes the	877.26	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	natural response say how does the stock	879.18	4.98
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	price crash by 75 if it is such a good	881.76	4.379
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	company okay so let me break it down for	884.16	3.84
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you and there are four specific reasons	886.139	4.081
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	why the stock price has corrected so the	888.0	3.779
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	first key reason is that you need to	890.22	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	understand who is the actual promoter of	891.779	4.56
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	land Pharma or who is a major partner of	894.12	3.959
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	grand Pharma so it's a company called as	896.339	3.721
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Shanghai Frozen farmer and by the name	898.079	3.301
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	itself you would have understood that	900.06	3.12
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	this is a Chinese company lot of	901.38	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	backlash against Chinese healthcare	903.18	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies to begin with they invested	904.74	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	heavily in gland Pharma around 2016-2017	906.54	5.4
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	month now the situation in China was	909.36	4.38
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	such and situation within this parent	911.94	3.839
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	group company was such that they were	913.74	3.839
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	struggling with debt why was that the	915.779	3.661
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	case so for that I'll have to decode the	917.579	3.601
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Chinese economy but very very quick	919.44	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	points there that housing crisis were	921.18	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	there in China internal health care	922.8	4.86
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	issues in China China exporting stuff so	924.72	5.1
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	a bunch of problems are festering so as	927.66	4.38
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	a result this fossan group had a debt	929.82	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	oriented problem and they were in talks	932.04	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	to sell gland Pharma and that	934.32	3.959
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	uncertainty remains reason number two	936.48	3.479
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	there was General petai of Pharma	938.279	3.961
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies take a look at Dr Lal path lab	939.959	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Devi's lab you name it right all the	942.24	3.959
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Pharma companies are Healthcare oriented	944.579	3.361
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies have been corrected quite	946.199	3.841
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	aggressively multiple reasons for that	947.94	4.259
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	but definitely gland Pharma also takes a	950.04	4.56
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	hit because of that wide beating of the	952.199	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Pharma industry the third key issue has	954.6	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	to do with the breakup of where gland	956.699	3.901
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Pharma supplies its material or exports	958.5	3.959
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that material for example here is a	960.6	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	breakdown of its entire revenue streams	962.459	5.041
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	it is exporting 71 of its product to the	964.32	6.24
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	US or make 71 revenues from the US and	967.5	5.16
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Europe it has a very big arm China it	970.56	4.019
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	depends quite aggressively so all these	972.66	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	markets have been subdued and therefore	974.579	3.901
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	gland Pharma also took a lot of petite	976.62	3.959
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	because of that fourth and finally is	978.48	3.84
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	something called as inventory built up	980.579	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	problem now this has been common I had	982.32	3.84
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	already explained it when I did the	984.779	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	consumer durables video that companies	986.16	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	like Whirlpool companies like Rebels	988.139	3.06
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	bunch of other different different	990.12	3.0
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies because a real estate market	991.199	4.021
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	was not picking up therefore these	993.12	3.24
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	companies had produced a lot of	995.22	3.119
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	inventory and it was just not getting	996.36	4.14
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	sold something similar was happening in	998.339	4.8
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the Pharma industry the 2020 covet came	1000.5	5.459
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	into equation these companies produced a	1003.139	5.281
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	bunch of stuff right and even now their	1005.959	4.261
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	inventory is sitting so this is a	1008.42	3.539
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	sitting inventory problem that even land	1010.22	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Pharma is suffering and here is a very	1011.959	3.421
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	quick snippet that comes from their	1013.94	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	management and this is a problem that	1015.38	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	even they are acknowledging now comes	1017.3	3.86
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the	1019.1	2.06
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	is it a good time to buy this stock now	1021.519	3.881
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	I cannot tell you whether you should be	1024.079	2.76
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	buying whether you should not be buying	1025.4	3.059
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	it depends on individual circumstances	1026.839	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	whether you want to increase position in	1028.459	4.021
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Pharma group what your holding period is	1030.559	3.78
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	so there are a lot of nuances that goes	1032.48	3.479
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	into picking a stock so you have to	1034.339	3.661
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	decide for yourself but this is what I'm	1035.959	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	thinking and I'll just quickly share my	1038.0	3.299
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	perspective with you that number one	1039.679	3.361
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	this company is clearly looking for	1041.299	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	growth now in Pharma there is something	1043.04	3.539
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	called as under so Anda does not mean	1044.839	4.141
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	egg it simply means new drug application	1046.579	4.621
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that have been submitted to the FDA	1048.98	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	approvals so if these new drugs get	1051.2	3.719
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	approved then these will go into	1053.48	3.059
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	production and the company will sell	1054.919	3.901
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	them and make money so this is what Anda	1056.539	3.901
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	means and the number of applications	1058.82	3.42
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that the company has bought it is high	1060.44	3.84
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	number two they have expanded their	1062.24	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	capacity already so this capacity	1064.28	3.899
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	actually generates result for the	1066.44	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	company over the coming years so I feel	1068.179	4.021
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that the worst for the stock is over I	1070.34	3.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	have started to build little bit of	1072.2	3.359
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	position as and when I build more	1073.52	3.659
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	positions I will announce it in the	1075.559	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	YouTube member Community section so then	1077.179	3.661
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	comes the the third stock which is Page	1078.919	3.901
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Industries in the interest of full	1080.84	4.079
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	transparency I'd purchased page industry	1082.82	3.42
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	roughly two two and a half years ago	1084.919	3.0
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	then I sold it when it gave a good run	1086.24	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	up and now I'm looking to rebuild my	1087.919	4.801
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	position so let me explain why so the	1090.32	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	first key point that you need to	1092.72	3.42
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	understand is regarding its stock price	1093.86	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	fall so what you will see is that if you	1096.14	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	consider this right and this is the	1098.36	3.24
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	total stock price fall that has happened	1100.1	4.439
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	so it has corrected by roughly 30 now if	1101.6	4.439
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you study the current level of price	1104.539	3.601
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	rise from the covered levels you will	1106.039	3.601
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	feel that you know what this stock is	1108.14	3.419
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	probably still overvalued because teen's	1109.64	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	already has gone like 115 percent run up	1111.559	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	it has given but consider the	1114.26	3.539
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	pre-covered level prices right so what	1116.179	3.661
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you will notice is that it has just	1117.799	4.561
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	given roughly 34 over the last three	1119.84	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	years now does this make the stock	1122.36	4.14
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	overvalued undervalued final point that	1124.16	3.84
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you need to consider is that consider	1126.5	4.02
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	here right this is 24th or 30th August	1128.0	5.28
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	2018 so almost five years and it has	1130.52	4.74
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	given zero percent return as of now so	1133.28	3.3
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	if you would have purchased this stock	1135.26	3.659
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	in bulk in August of 2018 and if you	1136.58	3.959
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	were holding it now you would be sitting	1138.919	3.361
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	on a zero percent profit on this stock	1140.539	3.961
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	in a period of five years now this is	1142.28	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the problem that happens when you are	1144.5	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	buying large cap companies and Bloated	1146.0	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	valuation there will be half of decades	1148.16	3.899
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	or even one one decades where you will	1150.32	3.719
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	make zero percent return so therefore I	1152.059	4.201
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	keep on insisting that please learn how	1154.039	4.741
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	to invest in stocks properly in case you	1156.26	4.38
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	are building direct positions otherwise	1158.78	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	I simply go and buy index you will make	1160.64	3.659
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	a lot less money but at least you will	1162.5	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	generate positive returns so anyways	1164.299	3.841
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	coming back to the topic I hope that the	1166.22	3.6
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	first key point is clear that the	1168.14	3.539
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	evaluations at least as per my	1169.82	4.739
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	understanding are not overvalued now let	1171.679	4.801
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	us combine this with fundamentals so let	1174.559	4.081
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	us look at at what rate the company has	1176.48	4.02
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	grown and what type of returns has the	1178.64	3.539
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	company given so take a look at sales	1180.5	4.799
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	from 2018 level right it has almost	1182.179	5.161
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	double let sales over the last five	1185.299	3.721
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	years right so this is one what about	1187.34	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	profits has it doubled its profit the	1189.02	4.019
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	answer is definitely yes it has doubled	1191.0	4.74
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	its profit so please remember this there	1193.039	5.041
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	is no problem from that perspective what	1195.74	4.14
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	else does it have very high it the	1198.08	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	answer is no absolutely not this is not	1199.88	3.48
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	very high levels of debt for a	1201.62	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	manufacturing oriented company then	1203.36	4.679
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	comes the national response stock price	1205.34	4.92
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	okay so same bunch of problems the	1208.039	3.781
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	number one problem that the company has	1210.26	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	faced it that it has been unable to	1211.82	5.04
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	increase the prices of its product this	1213.62	4.86
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	is the downside of the company that	1216.86	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	despite having a very strong brand like	1218.48	4.319
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	jockey it has not been able to adjust	1220.58	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	for inflation and pass on the price	1222.799	4.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	increases to the customers now what is	1225.02	3.96
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	the hypothesis behind it yeah see when	1227.059	3.48
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you are putting makeup people can see	1228.98	3.24
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you or if you are wearing an Apple Watch	1230.539	4.02
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	or using Apple laptop then people will	1232.22	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	have a certain impression of you so	1234.559	4.321
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	these are external indicators now unless	1235.94	4.2
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you are an ad you are not going to show	1238.88	2.94
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	your underwear and all so from that	1240.14	3.24
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	perspective the company struggled to	1241.82	3.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	increase its prices that's a simple	1243.38	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	understanding that I have now you'll	1245.0	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	make the same argument about	1247.28	3.12
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	hindustanian and liver see in Hindustan	1248.36	3.6
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	unilever's case when you are going and	1250.4	3.3
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	buying a shampoo you are worried about	1251.96	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	your Ganda shampoo right so therefore	1253.7	4.02
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you are at least little bit worried now	1256.28	3.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	what issue will you have if you are are	1257.72	3.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	buying underwear which is of slightly	1259.46	2.94
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	lower quality so this is my	1260.9	3.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	understanding of the equation it is very	1262.4	3.3
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	difficult for a company like page	1264.08	3.3
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	Industries to pass on the price	1265.7	4.02
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	increases to its customer so what has	1267.38	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	simply happened on the stock is that	1269.72	3.839
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	these stock price levels have adjusted	1271.7	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	it was given a very rich valuation	1273.559	4.62
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	simply valuations are correcting as of	1275.6	4.92
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	now it is not as if that the company has	1278.179	3.781
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	become bad and it will not show any	1280.52	3.779
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	growth this that problem is there yes	1281.96	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	competition will increase it's	1284.299	3.661
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	increasing in almost every industry but	1285.86	4.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that does not make the company bad now	1287.96	3.959
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you need to make a call that you know	1290.12	3.24
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	what whether the valuations are fair	1291.919	3.0
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	enough according to me these are okay	1293.36	3.48
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	valuations of course no one can be 100	1294.919	4.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	correct about valuations so according to	1296.84	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	me if you have just started to build	1299.179	3.601
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	your position and if you leave a little	1300.5	4.32
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	bit of margin for error you will make	1302.78	3.84
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	good money on this stock so this is my	1304.82	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	viewpoint and again I had made the	1306.62	3.419
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	announcement in the member Community tab	1308.36	3.42
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	that I had purchased page Industries	1310.039	3.601
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	okay so let me talk about one more stock	1311.78	3.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	I don't think I'll be able to discuss	1313.64	3.12
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	five because the video will become	1314.96	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	really big and maybe I will make a	1316.76	3.12
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	separate video for my Hindi Channel	1318.5	3.0
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	where I will discuss the remaining	1319.88	3.179
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	stocks that I wanted to talk about so	1321.5	3.179
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	I'll release that video in another three	1323.059	3.421
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	four days so the next talk that I'm	1324.679	3.721
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	going to speak about is called as astral	1326.48	3.84
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	so how much has the stock corrected by	1328.4	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	let me show it to you so this was the	1330.32	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	recent high and it has again corrected	1331.94	4.26
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	by roughly 30 now what you will notice	1333.86	3.48
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	here is and there are two three	1336.2	2.82
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	technical Trends first and foremost let	1337.34	3.18
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	me quickly speak about that and then I	1339.02	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	will do the fundamental analysis first	1340.52	3.3
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	thing is that this became one of the	1342.38	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	multi-wagger stocks during the covet	1343.82	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	crisis and you will see that it gave	1345.74	4.799
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	roughly 304 percent return during the	1347.72	5.339
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	covet crisis so if it has fallen by	1350.539	4.741
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	let's say roughly how much 30 40 so it's	1353.059	4.021
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	not as if that this has become suddenly	1355.28	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	highly discounted stock so please	1357.08	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	remember this this is a call that you	1359.0	3.659
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	will have to make also if you compare it	1360.62	3.9
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	to its pre-covered levels then you will	1362.659	3.861
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	see that it has given roughly 110	1364.52	4.68
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	returns over the last three three and a	1366.52	4.24
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	half years these are very very good	1369.2	3.54
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	returns by no standard this company is	1370.76	4.08
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	highly discounted as of now just by	1372.74	3.72
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	checking the previous levels now	1374.84	3.36
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	aggregate this data by doing some	1376.46	3.66
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	fundamental analysis is so let me take	1378.2	4.5
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	you through some data so the company has	1380.12	4.98
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	almost doubled its sales or even more	1382.7	4.02
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	than that every four or five years it	1385.1	5.459
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	does it for example go to 2013 802. by	1386.72	7.199
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	2018 it became 2073 next five years it	1390.559	5.641
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	has doubled again what about profits is	1393.919	4.681
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	it translating into profit so 2013 61	1396.2	5.28
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	2018 almost three times profit so yes	1398.6	4.86
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	one can say that it went to almost three	1401.48	4.439
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	times profit and it has been 3xing its	1403.46	4.44
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	profit every five years and 2xing at	1405.919	4.081
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	sales every five years this shows that	1407.9	4.74
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	this is a massive Growth Company so it	1410.0	4.919
HIBSBkemVHE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBSBkemVHE	growing by 110 percent over a period of	1412.64	4.019

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	money let me also represent that	368.16	2.879
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	graphically and then I'll move on to	369.72	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	point number two see what is going to	371.039	4.081
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	happen is fairly simple if you believe	373.38	4.14
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that bull run is there then it will move	375.12	4.079
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	something like this as any crashing yoga	377.52	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	crash will be there every once in a	379.199	3.241
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	while right it might happen like this it	381.0	3.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	might go like this but generally you are	382.44	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	on an upward moving trajectory so if you	384.12	4.019

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	or if you have already purchased it here	388.139	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	or here and if you write through this	390.0	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	entire bull run which might last for two	392.039	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	three years or maybe one year no one	393.9	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	knows then only you are going to make	395.759	3.961
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	money as a retail investor there are	397.5	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	just literally two ways that you will	399.72	3.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	make money as a retail investor first	401.1	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	option is that you buy cheap for example	402.84	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	uh the initial graphic that I showed you	404.94	5.16
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that I had purchased nifty 50 at 16 400	407.039	4.621
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	levels according to me that was cheap	410.1	3.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right that was inexpensive at that time	411.66	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	so I had done bulk investing there	413.52	4.92
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that's option one yeah second option is	415.38	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that you ride through the bull so so	418.44	2.759
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that's it that's how you're going to	419.94	2.879
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	make money otherwise you will have to do	421.199	3.181
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	fno sometimes you'll make money	422.819	3.061
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sometimes you'll lose crazy amount of	424.38	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	money and net net as per studies it has	425.88	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	been pointed out that fno Traders do not	428.46	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	make much money so I hope 0.1 is clear	430.56	3.479
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	let's move to 0.2 now the second key	432.36	3.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	point that you need to remember is that	434.039	4.261
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	please stop panicking this deliberate	435.78	4.319
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Panic that is created in the stock	438.3	5.339
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	market on good stocks then they fall big	440.099	6.181
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	investors buy them and then retail	443.639	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	investors sell them and then the stock	446.28	4.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	runs and then they start thinking	448.319	4.861
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	okay so let me illustrate that story by	450.38	4.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	talking about the example of page	453.18	4.019
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Industries so after the Friday session	454.74	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	I'm shooting this video on Saturday so	457.199	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	on the Friday session page industry	459.36	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	stock fell by 15 right and now you will	461.039	5.78
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	be thinking	464.46	5.28
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	and it has fallen to like 52 weeks low	466.819	6.88
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	on poor Q4 show so what exactly has	469.74	6.239
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	happened with paid industry and what is	473.699	4.201
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the meaning of poor Q4 show so let me	475.979	3.541
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	first and foremost take you to page in	477.9	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	industry fundamental so to say and	479.52	3.78
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	illustrate the point see if you take a	481.44	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	look at ERI sales right then it is	483.3	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sitting on highest ever sales it is	485.28	3.0
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sitting on highest ever profits so	486.84	3.359
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	earwise sales if you aggregate it no	488.28	3.539
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	problem but if you take a look at	490.199	3.361
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	quarter wise sales right so for example	491.819	4.621
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	March 2020 three quarter if you compare	493.56	6.06
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to Mars 2022 quarter you will see that	496.44	5.4
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the revenues have shrunk by roughly 15	499.62	4.799
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	20 and resultantly the profits have also	501.84	5.039
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	shrunk quite a bit now if you understand	504.419	4.141
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the point that as to why this is	506.879	3.361
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	happening and what is the reason for	508.56	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that then that 15 fall becomes a great	510.24	4.739
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	opportunity for you to buy otherwise if	512.52	4.019
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are we have recently purchased like	514.979	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	page Industries 15 fall you will go	516.539	5.401
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	crazy right okay so let me first and	518.82	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	foremost explain that what has happened	521.94	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	at page Industries I will give you my	523.5	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	very quick Viewpoint there and then you	525.54	2.94
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	can make a call whether it makes sense	527.04	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to buy these type of stocks or not so	528.48	3.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	okay so last year you would have heard	530.22	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that many companies have had input cost	531.6	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	pressure so what is the meaning of input	533.76	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cost pressure that raw material prices	535.26	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	have gone up coal prices have gone up	537.36	3.479
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	steel price have gone up construction	538.98	4.14
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	material prices have gone up similarly	540.839	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	what is the raw material for something	543.12	3.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	like page industry so they make like	544.68	3.98
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	undergarments	546.54	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right so so cotton becomes one of the	548.66	4.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	primary drivers of cost so if you take a	551.16	4.679
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	look at the Cotton prices last year it	553.38	4.76
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	went from what levels from approximately	555.839	6.241
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	7.7 US dollar all the way to two dollars	558.14	6.759
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right so almost three times price rise	562.08	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	in Cotton right so that's one so if you	564.899	4.021
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	take a look at cotton prices after covet	566.64	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you will see that it was roughly at like	568.92	5.4
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	0.5.6 and then it went all the way to	571.08	6.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	1.4 1.5 so at least double the way right	574.32	5.04
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	in within a one year it almost doubled	577.5	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	so this is massive pressure in terms of	579.36	4.8
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cost now what has started to happen well	581.94	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the prices have started to come down for	584.16	5.16
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cotton to its reasonable levels that is	586.5	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the most important point now use your	589.32	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	brain and think about the fact that if	591.0	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are a company like page Industries	593.04	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will you manufacture more at a time when	594.54	4.859
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cotton prices are here here or here the	596.94	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the short answer is no that you are	599.399	4.141
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	unlikely to do that why because your	601.56	5.16
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	variable cost variable cost will go up	603.54	5.82
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	so your profits are anyways going to get	606.72	4.559
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	crushed if you are manufacturing more	609.36	3.659
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	and more right you will not be able to	611.279	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	increase your product prices at such a	613.019	4.621
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	massive scale at which the cotton prices	615.12	4.26
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are going up so what page industry	617.64	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	decided to do was that they just decided	619.38	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to wait they said that you know what	621.3	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that let's say that in 2020 when the	623.04	5.04
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	prices were reasonable we manufactured	625.98	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	like thousand units of our product in	628.08	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	2021 we again manufactured 1000 units	630.18	5.64
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right our usual capacity in 2022 because	632.76	6.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the cotton prices are more right so that	635.82	6.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	is what they decided to do 2023 if the	639.12	5.399
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cotton prices have come back down they	642.3	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are again going to manufacture 1000	644.519	3.781
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	units what was happening was that this	646.26	4.139
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	was leading to pent-up inventory they	648.3	3.779
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	did not create a new inventory to begin	650.399	3.721
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	with if they do not have new inventory	652.079	3.421
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to begin with how are they going to	654.12	3.06
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	execute that in terms of more sales	655.5	3.839
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that's Party part B the good thing that	657.18	4.099
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	industry did was that they did not say	659.339	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	inventory we are going to sell it at a	661.279	5.021
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	loss no they did not do that that was a	663.899	4.201
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	problem that consumer durable companies	666.3	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	faced for example Whirlpool if it	668.1	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	manufactures a washing machine and if	670.14	4.98
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that is being kept with a retailer that	671.82	5.04
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	machine is losing value because	675.12	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	electronic products can get damaged on	676.86	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	top of that storage of a washing machine	679.44	5.579
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	is fairly big space right so all those	681.48	4.859
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	problems are there with consumer	685.019	3.661
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	durables which was not necessarily there	686.339	4.44

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right so we are not going to manufacture	692.24	3.64
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that much to begin with	694.38	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that will slow down the sales right that	695.88	3.78
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	does not mean that they are cutting	698.579	3.781
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	inventory at a loss and that also in a	699.66	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	way directly means that next step their	702.36	3.36

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	all-time high when I had been purchasing	830.04	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	nifty 50 somewhere here right here then	832.079	3.781
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	people were saying that you know RW or	834.36	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	giriga Market is that then people did	835.86	2.94
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	not purchase it when the previous	837.54	3.479
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	history of I was here right so people	838.8	4.26

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	here in bulk it might be a good decision	844.74	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	if what happens that if there is a very	846.839	4.021
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	clear breakout so this is the breakout	849.24	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	line right so 18 800 is the previous	850.86	5.279
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	iPhone ft if the Nifty breaks like this	853.32	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	it falls it breaks it it again Falls	856.139	3.901
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	like this and it will it will move like	858.42	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	this right or it could move like this so	860.04	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	this might be a great strategy that if	862.38	4.019
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are buying doing bulk buying above	864.42	4.919
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	18 800 levels because now you have a	866.399	5.641
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	very clear indicator gets a nifty 50 is	869.339	5.581
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	in a very clear Bull Run and 18 800	872.04	4.739
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	level has been decisive heavily broken	874.92	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	with volume if you are doing bulk buying	876.779	4.261

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	50. otherwise what can happen and let me	881.04	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	clear it out and draw it again otherwise	883.44	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	what can happen is let's see it will	885.36	3.779
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	rise like this it will fall it will rise	887.04	3.9

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	buying a good asset like nifty 50 when	915.839	5.761

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	but what you can do is that you can buy	921.6	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	some heavy weights if they are good but	923.639	3.961

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	goes back to its previous Peak there is	933.24	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	a good 16 17 18 gain which is to be	934.86	5.159
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	pocketed now two things can happen one	937.92	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	is that we keep on hovering in the range	940.019	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	17 800 all the way to let's say nineteen	941.76	5.699
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	thousand right so if you buy nifty fifty	944.699	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	now you're not going to make much return	947.459	3.24
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are going to make approximately zero	949.079	4.081
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	percent return second thing is that the	950.699	4.801
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	nifty 50 gives a massive breakout above	953.16	4.979
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	18 800 and we start trading in that	955.5	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	range of roughly twenty one thousand	958.139	3.121
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right so this is the range that we trade	959.699	3.601
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	in so from this you are going to make	961.26	5.04
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Returns on nifty 50 also right which you	963.3	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	might be lucky if you buy it at high	966.3	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	valuations and still get returns and	967.8	3.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	second thing is that these type of	969.48	3.299
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	stocks for example Asian paints which	970.92	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are heavyweights and Nifty they have to	972.779	5.101
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	move in order for Nifty to go to 21 000	975.0	5.579
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	and even if Nifty keeps on dancing in	977.88	4.079
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	this range then also very high	980.579	4.081
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	likelihood that Asian paints is going to	981.959	5.101
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	move up might go down move up and all	984.66	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that stuff so you might get an	987.06	3.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	opportunity to exit the stock in case	988.62	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you don't feel comfortable now all this	990.779	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	needs to be seen in correlation to the	993.12	4.86
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	fundamentals recently Asian paints	995.399	4.981
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	announced the result and it was these	997.98	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	results were magnificent right so	1000.38	3.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	everyone agreed to the fact that you	1002.06	2.88
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	know what Asian paints is doing	1003.74	2.76
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	wonderfully well so you can check this	1004.94	3.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	also so just quickly go and check here	1006.5	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	and you will see that you're not highest	1008.36	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	ever sales highest ever profits even if	1009.68	3.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	if you go quarter wise right forget	1011.54	3.419
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	about everything else even if you go	1013.04	3.359
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	quarter wise then also they are doing	1014.959	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	fine right March 2022 sales was how much	1016.399	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	seven eight nine three here it is eight	1018.8	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	seven eight seven so the point is that	1021.019	4.021
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the company is doing fabulously well	1023.3	4.74
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	inflation is pulling off input prices	1025.04	5.34
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are coming down very similar to that of	1028.04	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	page Industries so why is it that Asian	1030.38	4.02
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	paints going forward is not going to go	1032.6	3.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to its highest ever prices right in	1034.4	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	terms of stock it might take a year	1036.319	3.721
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	there might be Panic that can be created	1038.12	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that whistle right sir you can't do	1040.04	4.259
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	anything about it but just use basic	1042.319	4.441
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	brain right and think about it and if it	1044.299	4.681
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	makes sense then build your portfolio	1046.76	4.5

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	on to point number four which is that in	1054.74	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	a bull market and if you feel as for	1056.48	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	point one we are in a bull market you	1058.4	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	must pick some high value bits right and	1060.679	4.081
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	which could be little bit high risk but	1063.08	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	let me speak about it see take a look at	1064.76	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	this graphic and this shows the returns	1066.74	4.74
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that have been given by small cap and	1069.14	6.0
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	index and in a bull market whenever for	1071.48	5.46
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	example bull market would be that in	1075.14	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	2003 we had a bull market sensex gave	1076.94	4.64
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sensex	1079.34	6.06
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that 91.5 return here and small cap gave	1081.58	6.219
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	almost double the returns similarly 2007	1085.4	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	there was a bull run and here again	1087.799	4.141
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	small cap outperformed 2009 again bull	1089.36	6.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	run small cap outperformed by a lot 2012	1091.94	5.58
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	bull run again outperformed here again	1095.48	4.02
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	outperformed the point I'm trying to	1097.52	4.26
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	drive home is that small caps outperform	1099.5	5.64
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	nifty 50 sensex in a bull run if you	1101.78	5.639
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	feel that we are in a bull run or we are	1105.14	3.659
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	close to a bull run or Bull Run has just	1107.419	3.721
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	started then it might make a lot more	1108.799	4.26
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sense to purchase some small cap	1111.14	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	exposure if you are okay with the risk	1113.059	3.961
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	what is the easiest way to do it just	1115.1	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	simply go on any mutual fund buy small	1117.02	4.8
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cap 250 right don't buy small cap 100	1119.299	5.101
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	and let me also show you very quickly on	1121.82	4.8
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the technical chart here so let me show	1124.4	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you first nifty fifty so nifty fifty you	1126.62	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will see that it is almost at its	1128.6	3.3
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	all-time high what about medical app	1130.1	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	index so you will see that midica app	1131.9	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	has actually broken it's 52 weeks high	1133.94	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	so that has also given return but what	1136.1	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	about small cap so let us quickly go to	1137.9	4.139
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	small cap 100 and you will see that we	1139.64	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are still trading 21 from its speed	1142.039	4.561
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	large caps have given a run up midi caps	1143.96	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	have given an up if we are in a bull run	1146.6	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	why is it that small cap is not going to	1148.4	3.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	give a run up when you have the entire	1150.08	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	previous history that small caps	1151.52	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	outperform midi caps and large gaps in a	1153.62	4.26
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	bull run so from that perspective I	1155.84	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	think it makes a lot more sense to have	1157.88	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	small caps you can take individual	1159.74	4.86
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	positions also but for that you need to	1161.96	4.14
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	have courage if you don't have courage	1164.6	3.24
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	then please do not invest for example	1166.1	4.14
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	some small cap Medicap companies like	1167.84	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	avas financials they have fallen by 50	1170.24	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	something like Tarzan's has fallen grind	1172.28	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	well Norton has fallen so all these are	1174.86	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	good good stocks Kaya has fallen so all	1176.66	3.78
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	these stocks according to me are good	1178.7	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	again not an investment advice please	1180.44	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	check with your investment advisors and	1182.66	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	please do your own due diligence I gave	1184.76	3.539
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	detailed commentary please understand	1186.98	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right I mean whenever you are buying any	1188.299	3.361
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	individual stock please please	1190.58	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	understand why it is falling what type	1191.66	4.16
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	of arguments can be made for against it	1193.76	4.14
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	amritanjan people are getting scared you	1195.82	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	know what purchase	1197.9	5.279
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	small cap has fallen by how much right	1200.26	5.02
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	so if you check this there is a gap of	1203.179	4.441
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	approximately how much 20 21 now if	1205.28	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	amritanjan fell by 25 right and relative	1207.62	4.559
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Benchmark which is Nifty small cap is	1210.38	4.86
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	falling by 20 so as a way the answer is	1212.179	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	no it is not as if that you know	1215.24	3.24
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	something bad has happened but if you do	1216.559	3.24
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	not have the heart then please do not	1218.48	3.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	get into it my simple suggestion is that	1219.799	3.781
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	please pick assets that you are	1221.84	3.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	comfortable picking put some element of	1223.58	3.599
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	risk because this is where money is made	1225.559	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	because this part of your portfolio the	1227.179	4.921
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	small cap one this is likely to grow at	1229.4	5.22
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	50 60 your large cap if you're picking	1232.1	4.319
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	intelligently those will grow at 15 20	1234.62	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right Asian paints Mass anywhere that	1236.419	3.0
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you're going to make like 100 return	1238.22	2.94
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	over the next two years very good chance	1239.419	3.901
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that you might make 30 40 return on so	1241.16	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Point number five is that it's very	1243.32	3.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	important to rotate your funds now what	1244.88	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	is the meaning of rotation in funds it	1247.039	3.541
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	simply means that see some Industries	1248.72	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are up in a certain type of market then	1250.58	5.28
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	they have brought down so it's important	1253.82	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to understand where growth is unlikely	1255.86	4.8
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to happen right I'm not saying 100 Yogi	1258.5	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	but very unlikely that growth is going	1260.66	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to come or any massive return is going	1262.4	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to be made so for example according to	1264.5	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	me those are commodity stocks	1266.48	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Commodities stock do really well in a	1267.98	4.74
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	high inflation environment they do	1270.86	3.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	really well when there is some kind of	1272.72	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	trouble going on and they have a very	1274.28	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	long cycle so if you are into Metals if	1276.2	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are into cold if you are into	1278.84	3.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	infrastructure building firms you are	1280.4	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	going to struggle right so my simple	1282.559	3.301
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	suggestion is that move away from	1284.12	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	infrastructure and all this stuff rotate	1285.86	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	your money to something like Finance if	1287.96	3.24
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are a long-term investor two three	1289.82	2.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	years you are going to make good money	1291.2	3.78
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	rotate your overall Capital into	1292.539	3.88
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	manufacturing right so that is still	1294.98	2.76
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	better right compared to something like	1296.419	2.821
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	infrastructure development check	1297.74	3.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	consumer durables right so consumer	1299.24	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	durables are still trading at 30 35	1301.1	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	discount from their Peak why I gave you	1303.08	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the reason when I explained you the page	1306.2	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	industry story so from that perspective	1307.76	4.88
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	if you apply that same logic	1309.86	5.04
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	they had to sell their inventory at a	1312.64	5.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	loss last 12 18 months result would be	1314.9	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	bad in fact maybe this quarter might	1317.96	3.599
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	also be bad but go and check right go	1319.46	3.959
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	literally go and check the price of a	1321.559	4.86
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	microwave right now fridge TV AC all has	1323.419	5.101
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	gone up like crazy right I'm not kidding	1326.419	4.14
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right you tell me three years four years	1328.52	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	back if you're buying a microwave how	1330.559	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	much that used to cost and how much is a	1332.36	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	microwave costing now microwave I'm	1334.4	3.779
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	picking up because that is a product	1336.02	4.58
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that is very easy to track so to say so	1338.179	4.74
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right and then you tell me that after	1340.6	3.76
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	six twelve months what is going to	1342.919	3.061
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	happen to these companies are they going	1344.36	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to come back up short answer according	1345.98	4.02
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to me is a definite yes so now comes the	1347.84	4.14
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	final point that please cut uncertain	1350.0	5.22
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sectors now I have deliberately said	1351.98	5.22
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	time and time again that I am not a big	1355.22	5.16
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	believer in India IIT story TCS was the	1357.2	4.8
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	only stock that I had bought because I	1360.38	2.88
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	was getting it at cheap right	1362.0	3.24
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	approximately three thousand I sold it	1363.26	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	at 3 300 something like this I exited	1365.24	4.86
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the stock completely rotated that entire	1367.76	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	money when Nifty ID he was trading at a	1370.1	4.559
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	massive discount 30 35 Oddish percent	1372.38	4.74
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	discount I have rotated that money into	1374.659	4.02
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that all this information I have	1377.12	3.059
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	presented on member Community those	1378.679	3.301
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	posts are still there so from that	1380.179	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	perspective right now my only position	1381.98	4.8
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	in IT industry is in Nifty ID that's it	1383.659	5.52
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	nothing else I am highly uncertain about	1386.78	4.92
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the IT industry why because I'm not here	1389.179	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to tell you like pointless stories right	1391.7	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the ID Industries I don't know what is	1393.679	4.201
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	going to happen with IT industry I don't	1396.32	4.859
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	know if TCS will be able to come out of	1397.88	6.419
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	evolving in the cloud space onto more AI	1401.179	5.161
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	based stuff whether Wipro will do it	1404.299	3.961
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Infosys will do it TCS will do it just	1406.34	3.959
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	because TCS has done well over the last	1408.26	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	20 years does not make any sense why it	1410.299	5.581
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will be able to jump on that new tick	1413.36	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	bandwagon which is being centered around	1415.88	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cloud and Ai and is going to do	1417.559	4.081
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	exceptionally well I don't think so	1419.6	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	there is a very high likelihood that AI	1421.64	4.019
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	or certain tools in AI might be built	1423.799	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that might automate a lot of software	1425.659	4.801
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	development software replication so	1428.179	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	something like TCS is going to suffer is	1430.46	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	this change going to happen immediately	1432.559	3.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the I don't think so that this will take	1433.94	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	time to pan out commercial applications	1435.919	4.441
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will be built so this will take time so	1437.78	4.92
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	meanwhile I just want to swing it I will	1440.36	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sell it off when exactly I will cut my	1442.7	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	positions I will inform but my viewpoint	1444.86	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	on it is very simple that it is a highly	1446.9	3.3
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	uncertain space right now it is going	1448.7	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	through a lot of innovation so to say it	1450.2	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will have to revamp its business model	1453.02	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	some new companies all together might	1454.7	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	replace TCS I'm not too bullish on that	1456.5	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the only reason why I had built my	1458.78	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	position on Nifty it collectively is	1460.46	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that I was getting it at a super	1462.86	4.26
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	inexpensive price so go back to my two	1465.08	3.479
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	previous rules that retail investors	1467.12	3.059
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will make money if they're buying stuff	1468.559	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	for cheap second they are going to make	1470.179	4.74
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	money if they stick with the bull run so	1472.4	4.98
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	almost all my money is now invested in	1474.919	4.081
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the stock market I have to build little	1477.38	3.179
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	bit more positions which I will keep on	1479.0	4.02
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	building but mostly I am invested I am	1480.559	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	going to stay put in the bull run in	1483.02	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	majorly discounted stocks that's the	1485.179	4.261
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	intent with which I will be navigating	1487.46	4.02

PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	in today's video I am going to discuss	2.159	4.261
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	with you five stocks now these stocks	3.84	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	have fallen quite aggressively from	6.42	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their Peak these are very volatile	8.04	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stocks Point number three that the	9.78	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	entire Market is divided into two camps	11.46	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	one Camp is saying that you know what	13.86	3.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	these stocks have corrected by 50 50 60	15.48	4.92
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so let's go and buy them and they are	17.6	4.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	likely to become multibaggers and we are	20.4	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	getting them at a deeply discounted	22.14	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	prices the second group is saying that	23.58	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you know what these were bigger stocks	25.26	3.0
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would do stocks to begin with therefore	26.82	2.879
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	they fell in the first place so why	28.26	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	touch them so which faction is right I	29.699	4.081
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	am not here to debate that I'm simply	32.099	4.201

PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	specific moves that I'm making if I'm	49.379	3.721
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	buying certain stocks I will speak about	51.48	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it if I'm selling certain stocks I will	53.1	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	speak about it so this is an entire	55.14	3.059
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	investment community that we have built	56.64	2.939
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	over time and it is getting a lot of	58.199	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	positive feedback so you could consider	59.579	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	joining it now over to the main video so	61.559	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	let me start quickly discussing five key	63.48	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stocks the first key stock that I am	65.46	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	going to speak about is the adani group	67.38	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of stocks now many of you would say that	69.6	3.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you know what akshat	71.7	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you're after advani group no nothing	73.1	4.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	like this the reason why I'm bringing up	75.479	4.561
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adani group of stocks again is fairly	77.76	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	simple because the entire Indian market	80.04	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	right now is revolving around the adani	82.38	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	group when adani group moves up the	84.78	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Indian market moves up and when adani	86.7	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock falls down the Indian market falls	88.68	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	down so in order to understand the	90.42	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Indian market sentiment right now you	92.46	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	have to do a very quick analysis on the	94.32	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adani group of stocks so the first key	96.24	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	point that you need to understand about	98.34	4.139
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the adani group of stock is that these	100.02	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stocks are trading either in Upper	102.479	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	circuit or lower circuit now what is the	104.52	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	meaning of upper and lower circuit for	106.68	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that let me demonstrate an example about	108.78	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adani green Energy company and here what	111.18	4.439
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you would see is that it kept on falling	113.88	4.379
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	in a very linear fashion now if you go	115.619	4.981
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and check its five-day history 3 what	118.259	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you will notice that it is moving in	120.6	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this stepwise format that it was here	122.399	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	then it went up then it's plateaued then	124.68	4.499
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it went up plateaued went up plateaued	127.079	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so whenever you are seeing that	129.179	3.361
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	something is happening in a step format	130.739	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	like this or if something is falling	132.54	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	again in a step format like this this	134.94	5.04
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	means that this is a circuit stock now	137.64	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	how is this important this is something	139.98	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that normal retail investors need to	141.66	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	understand so again let's open the one	143.76	5.46
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	month window for adani green stocks and	146.4	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	what you would notice is that this was	149.22	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	actually consistently in the lower	150.84	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	circuit so this is the depiction of 30	152.7	4.98
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	days right so here there was constant	155.099	4.441
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	lower circuit so let's say that you	157.68	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	bought adani stock somewhere around	159.54	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	let's say 800 levels you thought that	160.98	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you know what coffee correct okay let me	162.84	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	buy it here and you purchased it now	164.76	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	next day when it fell by how much	167.34	3.479
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	percent so every day it kept on falling	169.14	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	by five five percent so next day it fell	170.819	3.721
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	by five percent then next day it fell by	172.5	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	five percent again then it fell by five	174.54	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	percent again now you're sitting on a 15	176.4	4.699
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	loss you're thinking	178.2	5.7
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	I should sell it and move on then what	181.099	4.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would you do you will place the sell	183.9	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	order on the stock but the problem is	185.76	5.22
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that if it is a lower circuit type of a	188.28	5.52
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock the chances are that your stock	190.98	5.7
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will not get a sold this is a very very	193.8	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	important point that you need to	196.68	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	understand just quickly recapping what	198.18	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you need to remember is let's see if you	200.58	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would have purchased it at 800 and the	202.5	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock fell to 700 also and you thought	204.42	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that okay now I will exit the stock even	206.519	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	if you want to sell it you might not	208.98	4.86
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	find counter buyers so this frequently	211.2	5.28
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happens in a circuit stock now what is	213.84	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happening in the adani group is that the	216.48	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	market sentiments have improved and the	218.22	5.099
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock has started to scale up and now it	220.5	4.799
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is getting into upper circuits so now	223.319	3.301
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	what is going to happen is that let's	225.299	3.061
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	say that you purchase azani group of	226.62	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies here and from tomorrow if	228.36	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	lower circuit comes then again you might	230.22	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	enter the same problem that I was trying	232.5	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to exhibit earlier so this is the first	234.299	3.241
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	key point that you need to understand	236.34	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that many of adani group stocks are	237.54	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	existing in a lower or upper circuit and	240.299	4.561
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	if you as a retail investor try to touch	242.64	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	them you can get burned very badly so	244.86	3.659
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is the first key message that I	246.9	2.94
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would like to give you the second key	248.519	2.821
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	message and I'm getting a lot of	249.84	2.34
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	questions that you know what	251.34	2.759
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	fundamentals of adani group has it	252.18	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	become better has it not become better	254.099	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	see I don't know and neither I am going	255.78	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to comment but a thing that I know for	258.0	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	sure is that adani group of companies	260.1	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are family owned family operated and	261.959	4.501
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	family controlled group of companies	264.66	3.539
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is not me saying this is a	266.46	3.299
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	shareholding pattern that you can take a	268.199	3.241
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	look at again I will put the chart	269.759	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	somewhere here and you yourself will be	271.44	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	able to make out that Nani group of	273.3	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stocks are family owned operated there	275.04	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is a separate video that I had done if	276.9	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you want more fundamental understanding	278.46	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	about the group please go and watch that	280.02	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	I will put the links in the description	281.94	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	box now knowing this fact is very very	283.44	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	important now why is that the case let	286.02	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	me explain that by using a simple	287.88	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	example so let's say that you're very	289.32	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	bullish about adani ports you think that	291.18	3.239
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you know what fundamentally it is good	293.16	2.94
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is that analysis I have done now I	294.419	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	want to buy adani ports yes you go and	296.1	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	buy it and maybe it's starts running	298.62	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	also but what is the guarantee that	300.36	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whatever profits the adani ports is	302.4	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	making it will one way or the other	304.62	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	might not get diverted to adani Green so	306.479	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is the precise problem that happens	308.88	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	in conglomerate stocks so you need to be	310.44	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	aware of that that debt can be inter	312.72	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	transferred the profits can be inter	314.4	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	transferred a lot of funny accounting	316.08	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stuff can happen now I am not trying to	318.12	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	portray the fact that you should buy an	320.1	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	order by adani group of companies that	321.6	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is very well your wish whatever you	323.22	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would like to do I frequently get a	324.9	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	question that at what levels will I buy	326.82	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adani group so the answer is at no	328.38	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	levels I'll be buying a tiny group why	329.88	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	because I might be doing analysis for	331.74	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this then how can I be sure that the	333.9	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	money will not get diverted to this so	335.82	3.599
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	for that particular perspective I will	337.8	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stay away from the anani group now comes	339.419	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the third and final point and it is a	341.1	3.539
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very very important fundamental point	342.96	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	which has to do with the interest rate	344.639	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you might have recently read the news	346.56	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that RBI is planning to hike the	348.6	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	interest rates by 25 basis points	350.94	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	similarly the U.S feds are planning to	353.1	4.319
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	increase the interest rate now why am I	355.38	3.539
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	bringing this up am I trying to scare	357.419	3.241
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you about the interest trade scenario in	358.919	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the world the short answer is no I'm not	360.66	3.599
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	trying to create fear-mongering what I'm	362.34	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	simply trying to tell you is that right	364.259	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	now the interest rates have already gone	365.82	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	up and they are still in the process of	367.68	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	going up one day these will Plateau and	369.6	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	then they will start falling but in this	371.639	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	entire Zone here when the interest rates	373.5	4.8
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are going up or will remain high what	375.539	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	type of companies will suffer the most	378.3	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so you guessed it right that companies	379.979	4.141
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that have very high debt are going to	381.96	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	suffer the most now I'll say that okay	384.12	3.359
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you keep on saying every time that Irani	385.62	3.299
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	group hide at company can you talk about	387.479	3.241
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	some other company yes I can definitely	388.919	3.481
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	talk about some other company and that	390.72	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company is called as vedanta group and	392.4	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it is somewhat struggling with this same	394.38	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	interest rate issue what is that issue	396.419	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it is the fact that they are unable to	398.46	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	refinance their debt or external	400.38	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	investors are saying that you know what	402.84	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	within the group you have so much debt	404.28	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	lying on your head and where will you	406.02	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	get the funding from and even if you are	408.06	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	able to do it you will be spending crazy	409.8	3.899
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	amount of money just repaying the	411.66	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	interest that you have taken from the	413.699	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	market again the story lies here that	415.44	3.599
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the interest rates right now are very	417.479	3.361
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very high again here is a chart for you	419.039	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you can check that how high the interest	420.84	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	rates currently are and it might very	422.639	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	well be the case that for the next one	424.86	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and a half two years companies like	426.479	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adani and vedanta which are very high	428.22	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	debt companies they are going to suffer	430.259	4.141
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a lot so back to adani group that will I	432.36	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	be buying adani group the short answer	434.4	3.299
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is no again please feel free to do	435.78	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whatever you feel like but please	437.699	2.761
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	explain your rational I would love to	438.96	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	hear contrary commentary and again the	440.46	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	type of investment community that we are	442.62	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	building everyone would appreciate each	444.36	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	other's Viewpoint the idea here is not	446.039	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to fight with each other but to present	447.66	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	contrary opinions so that everyone can	449.58	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	learn and form their own mind as to	451.86	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whatever they should invest their money	453.66	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	on so with that said let us move to	455.4	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock number two and let me detail out	457.08	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the conversation around the vedanta	458.94	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	group so first things first people who	460.86	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are not familiar with the vedanta group	462.84	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	let me quickly explain the business	464.46	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	model first they were the mining Barons	465.96	4.859
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so a lot of Mines they had in Goa a	468.479	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	bunch of other different parts of India	470.819	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and they used to be in the mining	472.68	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	infrastructure domain then they switched	474.479	4.021
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	majority of their business to oil and	476.46	4.98
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	gas so basically vedanta group is into a	478.5	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	series of different type of businesses	481.44	3.659
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	which has to do with Mining and oil and	482.94	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	gas they have a very large exposure to	485.099	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the Commodities market now what is the	487.56	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	meaning of commodity for example	489.419	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	aluminum you have you have coal you have	490.8	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	oil and gas so all these are what these	493.02	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are natural raw materials which is used	495.0	4.139
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	across different Industries so here are	496.8	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a few Salient points that you should	499.139	3.361
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	know first and foremost commodity Market	500.58	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	saw a massive boom cycle why because of	502.5	5.759
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	China why China consider for example	505.68	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that the Chinese real estate market used	508.259	4.861
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to use the most amount of Steel that was	510.78	4.439
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	consumed all across the world so that	513.12	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	was a major growth trigger for the steel	515.219	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Market aluminum market and again	516.959	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whenever real estate develops you would	518.82	3.0
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	need different types of mineral	520.62	3.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	components so China Market was driving	521.82	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the commodity prices really really high	524.339	4.261
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it was developing the real estate market	526.5	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it was developing the infrastructure	528.6	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Market it required a lot of energy so	530.58	4.319
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	many of the oil and gas company copper	533.1	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	aluminum type of companies they were	534.899	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	benefiting from the China's growth story	536.64	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	but unfortunately after after 2012 there	538.32	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has been lackluster performance in China	541.08	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the China's export Market is suffering	542.94	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	internally their real estate market is	545.16	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	hovering quite aggressively and that is	546.899	3.721
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	where the bad story of vedanta group	548.7	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	starts that they were a pure play	550.62	3.659
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	commodity type of a company and because	552.24	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of the slowdown in the Chinese real	554.279	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	estate market and bunch of other	556.32	3.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	internal consumption markets of China	557.82	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	vedanta also suffered quite badly now	559.64	3.94
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the second problem that the group	562.38	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	suffered it was very simple that the	563.58	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	interest rates are very very high and if	565.56	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the interest rates are inching the last	567.48	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	almost six seven years High then it	569.64	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	becomes a bad scenario for an	571.5	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	infrastructure driven company now when	573.12	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it comes to vedanta when it comes to	575.16	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adanis what do they need they require	576.959	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	massive amount of capital where will	579.3	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	they get this capital from they will get	581.519	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this Capital by borrowing money and	583.2	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whenever they are borrowing money they	585.18	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will have to pay a rate of interest on	586.74	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that money for example right now if you	588.72	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	have a home loan it might be inching	590.82	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	towards 10 which is very high home loan	592.44	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	rate so to cut the long story short all	594.899	3.841
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	these very heavy infrastructure driven	596.88	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies and they need to borrow it and	598.74	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whenever they are borrowing capital and	601.08	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whatever the rate of interest during	602.88	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that time is that defines the short-term	604.32	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Prospect of that stock which brings us	606.959	3.841
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to the third key trigger and third key	608.82	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	problem with the vedanta group of	610.8	3.479
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company which they are having issues in	612.24	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	terms of interest repayments and a lot	614.279	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of international organizations are sort	616.62	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of not sold on the entire vedanta story	618.779	4.381
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	now just for example Moody's has done an	620.88	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	analysis and they are saying that this	623.16	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is the amount of external debt that the	624.899	4.141
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company has and it can face a lot of	626.7	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	cash Crunch and refinancing crunch in	629.04	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the economy the final reason here	631.14	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	regarding the fall of vedanta stock is	632.7	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that the government itself is not very	634.8	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happy and it is in a war with vedanta	636.959	4.261
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the entire issue stems from the fact	638.94	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that Hindustan zinc which is a company	641.22	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and it is a venture between government	643.019	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of India and vedanta and what vedanta	645.06	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	does is that it also runs a sister	647.7	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company now vedanta what it is trying to	649.32	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	do is that it is fine to sell its sister	651.6	3.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company	653.579	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	which is jointly managed by government	654.98	4.299
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of India and the vedanta group now this	657.24	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is is causing serious worries and the	659.279	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	government has asked sebi to look into	661.5	3.899
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this so this issue is blowing up and	663.24	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	there is less Clarity on this entire	665.399	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	topic someday some positive news comes	667.079	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the stock gives a massive run up someday	669.18	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	negative news comes the stock Falls	671.459	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	quite aggressively so talking about my	673.019	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	verdict on the stock will I be investing	675.24	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	in it the answer is no I will not be	676.92	3.599
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	investing in it simply because of the	678.72	3.359
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Viewpoint that yes the stock has	680.519	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	corrected quite aggressively and it has	682.079	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	been correcting quite aggressively but	683.94	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	at no level you should be investing in	685.86	3.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies where fundamental Clarity is	687.66	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	not there as to where the business is	689.579	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	going to head and if it has serious	691.38	4.199
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	macro issues for example repayment of	693.54	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	debt or interest rates are going to	695.579	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	continue to hurt these type of companies	697.62	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	then generally my particular suggestion	699.48	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would be to stay away from such stocks	701.459	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	okay so the third stock is zomato so	703.38	4.139
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	here is my updated perspective on zomato	705.66	3.239
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	let me quickly explain you the	707.519	3.181
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	fundamentals but let me very quickly	708.899	3.481
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	touch upon the technicals first and how	710.7	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	much the stock price has corrected so	712.38	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	here you can see that the stock price	714.36	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has corrected quite aggressively by	715.92	4.8
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	approximately 70 percent from its stock	718.2	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and when was the top made it was made	720.72	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	almost at the IPO in time since then	722.459	5.101
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato has taken a massive beating now	724.92	4.919
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is there only negative news only or is	727.56	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	there some kind of positive that we can	729.839	4.021
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	observe so the thing is that in startups	731.339	4.321
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	where profits are not there for example	733.86	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato is not really a profitable	735.66	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company yes their revenues are going up	737.279	4.141
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	up and up but their cost is also Rising	739.5	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so therefore it is not a profitable	741.42	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company it is a growth story driven	743.279	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company that people buy zomato stocks	745.62	3.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	because they believe that you know what	747.899	4.321
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato is going to make crazy profits	749.36	4.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and therefore if we buy it now today we	752.22	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will get it at a very good price and we	754.079	4.561
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	might be getting it at an hul type of a	756.6	4.679

PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	about the business fundamentals of the	766.74	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies so let me explain that very	768.66	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very quickly but Point number one that	770.1	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you need to notice that these type of	771.72	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies usually go through a price	773.519	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Discovery process now what is the	776.04	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	meaning of price Discovery it's means	778.079	4.021
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that the firm iPod here then it dance	780.06	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	around Consolidated then it went up a	782.1	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	little bit then it fell fell fell and	784.079	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	then it started consolidating so this	786.06	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	could be considered as a major	788.399	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	consolidation zone for the stock it has	789.839	4.8
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	been almost one year so this is April	792.36	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	data what we are looking at here this is	794.639	4.021
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it and this is almost March so in this	796.26	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	one year the stock has been	798.66	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	consolidating in this price point now no	799.98	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	one can say for sure that what is the	802.74	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	correct price of a stock but what we can	804.42	4.919
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	definitely agree on is that for the last	806.82	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	one year zomato stock has been	809.339	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	consolidating in this range of 70 to	811.44	5.699
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	roughly 4748 so this is the range where	814.079	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you are getting the stock now please	817.139	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	understand that in the last one one and	818.76	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a half years the market sentiments in	820.74	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the Indian markets or overall even in	822.66	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the World Market has been really bad so	824.579	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	if a particular stock like zomato which	826.62	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	goes through a price Discovery process	829.26	4.319
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	where almost 70 correction of the stock	830.94	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has happened and it has been	833.579	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	consolidating for almost a year this	835.32	5.22
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	becomes a very strong consolidation Zone	837.779	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is the key point that I would like	840.54	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to establish so what does this simply	842.399	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	means that it might very well happen	844.32	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that zomato corrects little bit more or	845.639	4.981
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	maybe like 20 30 more who knows but it	847.8	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is very likely that it will revisit this	850.62	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Zone very very quickly or it might also	852.48	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happen that once the market starts	854.76	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	giving a run up zomato becomes like a	856.68	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very very strong that becomes a	858.779	3.481
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	multi-bagger so to say now to understand	860.22	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that and evaluate that you need to	862.26	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	understand the business changes that	864.12	3.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato is making so the first key change	865.8	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that zomato is making that it is	867.839	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	focusing Less on its 10 minute delivery	869.82	4.199
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	model this isn't a very important change	872.279	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	because up until six seven eight months	874.019	3.841
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	back everyone was talking about 10	876.06	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	minute delivery you know and everything	877.86	3.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will be good this that but that 10	879.6	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	minute delivery thing is done and dusted	881.579	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to a very large extent we can all have	883.56	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	our opinions but the 10 minute delivery	885.779	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	model was not a very profitable thing it	888.12	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	was a cash burn but unfortunately or	890.459	5.041
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	fortunately the VCS have started telling	892.86	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the companies like zomato and VCS were	895.5	5.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	investors in zomato so this	897.6	3.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and this is the same message that has	902.24	4.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	gone out to almost all these startups	904.56	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and all these startups are now trying to	906.72	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	run that profitability race rather than	908.88	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	mad expansion race second thing what	911.1	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	they have started to do is that they	913.26	2.879
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	have started focusing on their core	914.519	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	business so again I will link zomato's	916.139	3.361
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	case study in the comment and	918.42	2.64
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	description box you can go and watch it	919.5	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that will give you a better sense about	921.06	3.899
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato's business model but for this	922.68	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	video you need to understand the very	924.959	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	simple fact that zomato is focusing	926.639	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	elsewhere its core business model is	928.38	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	number one marketing that it makes a lot	930.6	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of money through the marketing platform	933.06	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that it has what is the marketing	934.92	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	platform the app itself that hotels or	936.66	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	restaurants who are getting featured on	939.12	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato they pay zomato a lot of money to	940.92	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	get featured so that they get more	943.38	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	visibility and more business so that is	945.0	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their first key model that they're	947.04	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	looking at and second is the delivery	948.48	3.659
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	partner model so there zomato has almost	950.22	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	50 market share which is fairly	952.139	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	substantial the other 50 would be owned	953.94	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	by swiggy so this is a split market so	956.519	3.721
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to say so the Logistics Market is	958.199	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	figured out but the ad spent on	960.24	3.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	marketing Market is where zomato is	961.98	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	aggressively focusing right now and the	963.959	3.301
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	number one announcement that they have	966.0	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	made is that they are asking the	967.26	4.86
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	restaurants now to keep a budget of at	969.24	4.8
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	least five percent for Revenue	972.12	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Generations by giving marketing budget	974.04	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to zomato so this is a big number that	976.199	3.721
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	now what zomato is saying that you know	978.48	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	what you have to give us five percent of	979.92	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	your marketing budget whatever sales we	981.54	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are helping you generate so in a way we	983.16	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are taking five percent stake in your	985.32	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company like automatically in one store	986.82	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	on top of this they will charge like	988.74	3.599
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	delivery fees they might do like zomato	990.42	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	gold what not so there are multiple	992.339	4.261
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Avenues through which zomato can turn	994.38	4.379
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	profitable now keeping this you point in	996.6	3.299
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	mind there is a lot of positive	998.759	2.281
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	commentary that is happening with	999.899	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato's talk for example This research	1001.04	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	report here has given it a price target	1003.259	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of 74 rupees which is a substantial jump	1005.12	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	from where it is currently trading again	1007.339	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is not a push that you go in and	1009.5	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	wears go don't invest I'm just simply	1011.12	3.659
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	helping you understand the model that	1012.92	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	for the timing it looks like the zomato	1014.779	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is actually trying to play the	1016.88	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	profitability game they are focusing on	1018.38	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their Core Business they are expanding	1020.6	3.359
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	into interesting things no doubt about	1022.399	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that and they are also trying to burn	1023.959	4.021
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	less money by avoiding businesses like	1026.059	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	10 minute delivery and what not so this	1027.98	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is the overarching Viewpoint that I will	1030.02	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	give so for me also I would see the	1031.52	3.899
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock rising to roughly 74. so this is	1033.439	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the Target that I also have in mind I	1035.419	3.481
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will update more on the members	1037.459	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Community section so now let's move on	1038.9	3.179
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to the fourth stock which is the	1040.819	3.301
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	somewhat of a brother of zomato which is	1042.079	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	paytm so paytm also suffered somewhat of	1044.12	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a similar fate to zomato that it got	1046.699	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	listed got crushed by 70 and every day	1048.62	4.92
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it was a bloodbath so let me very	1051.799	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	quickly talk about some of the investor	1053.54	4.139
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	sentiments on paytm very very quickly by	1055.4	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	showing you some Snippets so Point	1057.679	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	number one is that Maguire research has	1059.24	4.92
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	given a target for paytm at rupees 600.	1061.1	5.52
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	right now the stock is trading at 450	1064.16	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	rupees roughly so this is a substantial	1066.62	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	jump that they are predicting will it	1068.84	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happen will it not happen let me give	1070.64	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you my commentary now Goldman Sachs have	1072.14	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	also given it a very positive commentary	1074.48	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that they are seeing the Target price at	1076.52	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	1150 rupees also if you consider the	1078.26	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	shareholding pattern of zomato you will	1081.26	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	see a slight uptake in the dii holding	1083.0	4.799
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of zomato so the AI are domestic	1085.94	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Institutional Investor these are Big	1087.799	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	investors from India for example AMC	1089.96	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies mutual funds is that and fiis	1092.179	4.86
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	also haven't really reduced the state so	1094.52	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	everything looks hunky-dory then why is	1097.039	3.181
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it that people are getting tensed about	1098.78	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	paytm this looks like a great buying	1100.22	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	opportunity should you do it should you	1101.84	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	not do it okay so here is the counter	1103.28	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	argument so counter argument one so	1105.14	3.539
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their lead investor which is the and	1107.12	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Financial Group it plans to exit the	1108.679	4.981
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	paytm stock when it is going to do that	1111.44	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	I don't know but they are very likely to	1113.66	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	do that now rational has also been	1115.88	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	explained and the rational that was	1117.679	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	given was that paytm has actually done a	1119.299	5.161
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	lot of stock buyback when the stock has	1122.059	3.841
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	fallen quite aggressively somewhere	1124.46	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	around last year 197 communication which	1125.9	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is the parent group for paytm it had	1128.48	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	purchased its own stock now you'll say	1130.34	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that okay this is actually a good sign	1132.44	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that the stock fell and the company	1134.12	5.4
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	purchases its own stocks so it shows	1136.88	4.679
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	positive intent it shows that they are	1139.52	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	believing in their own company so yes	1141.559	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and no because sometimes these type of	1143.48	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	moves are made just to arrest the fall	1145.22	5.04
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that since the company does not want the	1148.1	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock to fall more because what is going	1150.26	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to happen so imagine that there are 1000	1151.88	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stocks the company ends up purchasing	1153.5	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	100 stocks back so what would that do	1155.24	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that will stabilize the other 900 stocks	1157.22	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	otherwise the company might end up in a	1159.44	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very big soup so from that perspective	1161.6	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	don't read too much into it that they	1163.22	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	had to do a lot of buyback was it a good	1164.9	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	move was it not it's highly complicated	1166.82	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so let's not go there but the argument	1168.5	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that is given here is that you know what	1170.78	3.899
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and financial is going to sell the paytm	1172.34	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock why because they had already	1174.679	3.181
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	purchased quite a lot now they have to	1176.36	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	put It On a Block deal and sell it off	1177.86	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that is going to lead a little bit of	1179.6	4.199
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	fall for paytm stock subsequently in the	1181.46	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	future it might happen in one month it	1183.799	2.941
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	might happen in three months no one can	1185.36	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	guess now couple of more issues one has	1186.74	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to do with business fundamentals now if	1188.84	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you take a look at the business of paytm	1191.0	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their primary business is still the	1192.86	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	wallet's business and all this stuff	1194.6	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is not a money making business for	1196.4	4.98
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	example paytm does a lot of transaction	1199.34	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	from its payment wallet so to say or in	1201.38	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	terms of making payments but they take	1203.6	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	rate take rate means that how much money	1205.76	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the company is making from those	1207.38	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	transactions the volume of transaction	1208.82	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	might be 10 000 crore but if the company	1210.74	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is only making one crore or five crore	1212.36	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	from it it is not a very high profitable	1213.98	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	business so to say then comes the	1216.26	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	banking thing now the banking license	1218.12	4.919
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has been given by RBI then some changes	1220.34	5.52
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	were made to it RBI stopped paytm from	1223.039	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	doing certain type of business there was	1225.86	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a lot of hoopla that was there the area	1227.72	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	where paytm is doing wealth is the	1229.64	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	wealth management arm for example when	1231.62	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it comes to mutual funds equities and	1233.419	3.061
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you might have also seen it that that	1235.22	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you can buy all this stuff from paytm's	1236.48	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	app also and invest in mutual funds so	1238.64	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that business for paytm is picking up	1240.62	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	but the problem is that the entire stock	1242.66	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	market itself is going down so the	1244.46	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	mutual fund industry is not recovering	1245.9	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	as of now maybe it will recover in the	1247.7	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	future and maybe that will help paytm	1249.74	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	but that again becomes a little bit of a	1251.539	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	timing issue so none of the arms that	1253.64	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you are seeing for paytm it is churning	1255.74	4.439
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	money so to say Mr Vijay shekhar Sharma	1257.6	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is of the opinion that paytm will turn	1260.179	4.141
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	profitable very quickly that remains to	1262.28	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	be seen but as of now there is a lot of	1264.32	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	volatility associated with paytm and	1266.36	4.319
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	even if from a Core Business perspective	1268.76	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	we cannot Point our finger and say that	1270.679	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you know what this part of paytm's	1272.36	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	business model is going to become like	1274.22	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	golden so please remember that point so	1275.78	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	my verdict on the stock would be that	1278.48	2.88
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	yes the stock has fallen quite	1280.039	2.88
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	aggressively it is getting to a point	1281.36	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	where it might not be a bad idea to	1282.919	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	acquire it but I will still wait and	1284.9	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	watch now comes the final stock I'll be	1286.46	3.0
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	quick here otherwise the video will	1288.2	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	become really big so the final stock I'm	1289.46	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	going to talk about is Tata lxc now Tata	1291.5	4.799
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Galaxy is actually a good company and it	1294.2	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is into three different streams see so	1296.299	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the first key thing that Tata Galaxy	1298.7	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	does it does industrial design second it	1300.5	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	does is embedded product design and	1303.14	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	third is the software applications	1305.0	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	associated with it it gets clients from	1306.559	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	primarily to Industry one is the	1308.78	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	healthcare industry and the second is	1310.52	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the automotive industry now the problem	1312.32	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is that both Healthcare and Automotive	1314.48	4.439
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Industries are both struggling both have	1316.52	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a ton of inventory that is sitting on	1318.919	3.181
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their book and you might have seen that	1320.6	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies like maruti they have not	1322.1	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	given even one percent return over the	1323.72	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	last five years zero percent return so	1325.52	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it's a problematic situation in both	1327.2	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	these companies and as a result Tata	1328.88	4.799
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Elixir stock has also taken a nosedive	1330.98	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	now the business update with Tata LX is	1333.679	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very simple that it has categorically	1336.08	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	mentioned on its report that it is going	1338.299	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to move a lot of this product design	1340.34	4.94
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	business into industrial design business	1342.559	5.941
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	now the industrial design business is a	1345.28	5.379
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	more profitable business now let me take	1348.5	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you to the profit and loss statement	1350.659	2.821
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	what you will see is that okay the sales	1351.98	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are going up that is wonderful no doubt	1353.48	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	about that but more interestingly the	1355.82	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	profit margins are going up for example	1357.74	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that these profit margins are better	1360.02	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	than the pre-covered time profit margins	1362.48	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so from that perspective what is	1364.7	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happening with the company is that the	1366.32	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company is deliberately trying to shift	1367.76	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	his business to Industrial design	1369.5	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	business this becomes the money making	1371.24	4.919
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	arm of the business also the stock is	1373.28	5.639
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	available roughly at 40 discount and it	1376.159	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has been consolidating for the last	1378.919	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	several months almost like seven eight	1380.539	3.361
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	months have happened that these stock	1382.159	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has been consolidating in this	1383.9	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	particular range so my game plan has	1385.82	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	been that I've started to aggregate this	1388.159	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	talk a little bit and going forward I	1389.84	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will continue to aggregate this a bit	1391.7	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	more this is fresh positions for me so	1393.38	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whenever I am buying more of this stock	1395.659	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	I will make Community updates now the	1397.159	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	major risk with this company right now	1399.2	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is that the industrial design business	1400.76	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that I spoke about that is a highly	1402.44	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	competitive business now Tata Galaxy is	1404.539	4.081
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	not just going to have competition from	1407.0	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	within India it is also going to have	1408.62	4.86
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	competition from outside India but the	1410.9	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	good thing is that the company is	1413.48	2.939
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	preparing for it for example it has done	1414.62	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a partnership with Panasonic which is	1416.419	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	good second key thing is that almost all	1418.82	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the geographies beat Russia beat China	1421.1	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	beat India they are becoming slightly	1422.9	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	more localized so the Indian government	1424.94	3.359
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is going to protect the local	1426.679	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	manufacturing base and a company like	1428.299	4.441
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Tata Alexi actually benefits from it so	1430.34	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is the perspective with which I	1432.74	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would be operating in the stock market I	1434.24	3.36

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	said let me take you through eight	108.24	3.839
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	specific points that I want to discuss	109.799	4.381
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	with you so Point number two and the	112.079	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	prediction number one that I had made	114.18	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	back in December of 2022 was that the	115.74	4.919
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	market is going to fall by approximately	118.5	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	10 percent so this is me saying the same	120.659	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	thing very very good chance that we will	122.759	5.161
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	see a 10 correction in the year 2023. so	124.619	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	let us see whether that prediction has	127.92	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	come true and there are two three very	129.539	3.481
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	important points that I would take you	131.28	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	through so the first key point is and	133.02	2.76
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this is where I've made the prediction	134.52	3.299
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	somewhere in December the markets after	135.78	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that fell by roughly eight percent so	137.819	4.261
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	not exactly 10 but roughly eight percent	139.92	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so I could say that this prediction was	142.08	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	partially true after that the markets	144.48	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have been running and to what extent has	146.4	3.419
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these been running so they have	148.44	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	approximately given as of today roughly	149.819	4.621
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	11 percent gain so if you would have	152.34	3.84
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	purchased a lot of stuff here in this	154.44	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Zone you would have been sitting on a	156.18	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	lot of profits now that is a sales board	157.86	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there is no point in talking about it	159.9	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	what I would like to talk about is this	161.58	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	new phase and this is the phase that I'm	163.86	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	talking about this is more important as	165.72	5.04
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of today why is that it is because of	167.64	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this channel that is getting formed so	170.76	3.119
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	all I've done is that I have drawn the	172.5	3.599
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	support and resistance Line This is a	173.879	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Clear Channel that is getting formed and	176.099	3.241
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there is a very clear technical	178.019	3.181
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	indicator that are getting played here	179.34	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and it looks like that if nothing major	181.2	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happens from this point then this	183.48	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	channel is likely to be respected so	185.459	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	many of you might be sitting and asking	187.86	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the question now that should I wait	190.319	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	should I wait for like maybe two three	192.18	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	months and then start investing I would	194.28	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	say no I would rather encourage you to	196.2	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	build some positions here why because	198.54	4.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you are at this lower end of this	200.7	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	channel there will be times when this	202.739	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	channel would be broken there is a very	205.14	3.239
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	good probability of that happening for	206.76	3.119
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	example the channel might go like this	208.379	3.241
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it may come down like this it might go	209.879	3.301
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	like this it might come down like this	211.62	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and it might get broken also that is	213.18	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there but the point is that this channel	215.28	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	is a very strong channel that has	217.14	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	already got informed so we need to go by	218.76	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	technicals as of now so according to	221.22	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that at least as of now since no major	223.08	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	macro changes are happening per se it is	225.12	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	very very likely that this channel is	227.22	4.019
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	going to get respected and from that	229.2	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	perspective building position or at	231.239	4.321
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	least being 80 invested in the markets	233.159	4.681
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	right now makes a lot of sense so that	235.56	3.899
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	is my understanding of it of course you	237.84	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	can have a contrarian Viewpoint you can	239.459	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	wait for the markets to correct if you	241.26	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have some internal knowledge that you	243.42	2.76
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	know what channel breakdown will happen	244.92	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	here here somewhere there probably you	246.18	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	can do that but as of today Point number	248.4	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	B is that we are definitely in a bull	250.86	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	run I have been saying that for the last	252.9	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	several months that we are in a bull run	254.64	5.04
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I have been orienting my portfolio	257.16	4.799
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	accordingly Community channel members	259.68	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	accordingly I had been explaining every	261.959	4.621
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	single macro commentary quite diligently	264.6	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and you can go and check out all these	266.58	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	posts on channel membership Community	268.32	3.659
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these are still available and this bull	269.88	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	run is going to get accelerated from	271.979	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this point but let me very quickly	274.02	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	present what I had said back in December	275.639	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of 2022 I had said this things are going	277.74	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to happen when it comes to interest rate	280.5	3.0
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Point number one is that the interest	282.0	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rate rise is going to slow down so it is	283.5	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	being forecasted that the interest rate	286.08	5.52
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	in the US will rise to 5.5 then the	287.94	5.52
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	interest rates will start to get cut	291.6	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	down now this is a major point because	293.46	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	whenever the interest rates are cut down	295.8	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the stock market rallies by aggressively	298.02	5.16
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	for example 2008 was a prime example	300.66	5.16
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	2020 kovit was up so now I have been	303.18	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	harping on the fact that we are in a	305.82	3.18
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	bull run and this bull run is going to	307.38	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	get accelerated what makes me say that	309.0	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so one of the central points that make	311.1	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	me say that is the concept of interest	312.78	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rate again I'd explain that presented	314.52	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that entire explanation on that December	316.74	5.1
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	2022 video I will present a very quick	319.02	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	updated version of that see so take a	321.84	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	look at this particular chart what you	323.94	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	will notice is that these are the	325.74	4.679
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	interest rates in India right and what	327.24	5.64
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happens generally in the market is that	330.419	5.101
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	if the interest rates are cut what this	332.88	4.98
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	leads to this leads to more credit flow	335.52	5.28
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	or flow of money in the economy so the	337.86	4.679
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	flow of money will go up if the interest	340.8	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rates are being cut now if the credit	342.539	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	flow in the economy goes up then what	344.759	4.201
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	does that lead to well it leads to the	347.039	3.781
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rocketing or increasing of the stock	348.96	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	market this has played out back after	350.82	6.18
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	2008 this has laid out after 2020 crisis	353.16	6.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	also this has played out after almost	357.0	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	every a single crash so what exactly is	359.28	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happening in this chart so what you will	361.68	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	notice is that India increased its	363.3	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	interest rate from roughly four percent	366.0	5.1
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	all the way to 6.5 and now you might be	367.74	4.98
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	seeing this flat line I'm not sure if	371.1	3.539
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you are able to see this clearly but it	372.72	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	is flat lining why is that the case the	374.639	4.801
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	reason is that the RBI or Reserve Bank	376.979	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of India had decided that you know what	379.44	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	we are just going to pause the rate hike	381.06	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	First Step there is that the central	383.1	3.719
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	banks increase the interest rate second	384.6	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	step is that they pause the interest	386.819	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rate increase third step is that they	388.38	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	cut the interest rate we have already or	390.419	4.441
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	we are already reaching that point where	392.639	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	interest rates hike have been passed or	394.86	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the rate of interest rate hike has been	397.5	4.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	paused Next Step the moment it happens	399.66	3.659
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that the interest rates are being	401.699	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	brought down stock market will become	403.319	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rocket now to what point will the stock	405.419	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	markets go up please watch the entire	407.34	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	video you will get that understanding I	409.08	3.119
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	will reveal the answer along the way	410.88	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	also but this is one of the reasons why	412.199	4.681
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I'm saying that despite being at 18 500	414.36	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	right now we are not finished with that	416.88	4.439
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	bullet that bull run is about to start	419.28	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it will ramp up massively when these	421.319	4.981
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	interest rates are cut and this will not	424.08	4.739
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happen only in India this will happen in	426.3	4.619
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	relationship to the entire world even	428.819	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the U.S well-cut its interest rate even	430.919	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	India will cut its interest rate so very	432.84	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	quickly taking you to United States data	434.88	4.319
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	also so you will see that it has peaked	437.16	5.52
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to 5.5 percent and it is now being	439.199	5.581
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	assumed by analysts that from this point	442.68	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there will not be a massive interest	444.78	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rate hikes there will be interest rate	446.759	4.621
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	cuts it might happen that the markets	448.86	5.7
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	can go in this range of 18 500 to maybe	451.38	5.759
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	like 19 000 in India over the period of	454.56	4.74
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	next three four months but by the end of	457.139	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this year it is very very likely that we	459.3	3.839
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	will definitely beat that nineteen	461.22	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	thousand nineteen thousand five hundred	463.139	3.301
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	levels very easily so this brings me to	464.34	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the third prediction that I had made in	466.44	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	December of 2022 which was about the U.S	468.06	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stock market I had categorically said	470.94	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that the U.S stock market is going to	472.86	3.839
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Rally like anything especially their	474.72	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	indices NASDAQ and s p 500. if you want	476.699	4.921
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to use this information to make a lot of	479.4	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	money then you could consider building	481.62	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	some positions in the U.S stock if your	483.12	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	risk appetite matches so from that	485.16	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	perspective I would say that there is a	487.08	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	good opportunity in NASDAQ and S P 500	488.94	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	right now this is not a buying or	491.46	3.239
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	selling recommendation I'm just simply	493.199	2.94
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	telling you whatever I am doing in the	494.699	3.181
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	market if it makes sense then you could	496.139	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	consider building some positions	497.88	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	especially given the fact that these	499.259	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	entire broad market index which are	501.3	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	relatively less risky they are trading	503.22	4.319
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	at a massive discount right now in the	505.68	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	US so here is the run-up for Nasdaq over	507.539	5.101
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the past six months it has gone up by	510.3	6.0
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	roughly 16 17 so making 16 17 free money	512.64	7.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	almost on a solid asset like NASDAQ	516.3	5.22
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	where the risk profile is very very low	519.839	3.901
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	according to me that's a great bet I had	521.52	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	been investing quite heavily in the U.S	523.74	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stocks I will be building more positions	525.779	4.201
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	in U.S stocks specifically I will	528.3	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	disclose the names on the member	529.98	3.299
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Community section even right now	531.6	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	investing in the U.S stocks makes sense	533.279	4.141
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	was it a better opportunity six months	535.32	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	ago five six months ago 100 yes it would	537.42	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	was definitely a better opportunity than	539.399	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	compared to now but that does not mean	541.5	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that right now the U.S market is like	543.899	3.721
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	completely done with and there are no	545.94	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	profit making opportunities there there	547.62	3.779
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	are multiple profit making opportunities	549.6	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there so let me present a very quick	551.399	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	updated analysis there also so here is	553.26	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the last six month chart you can clearly	555.42	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	see that 18 gains have been achieved if	556.92	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you consider this right you will see	559.56	5.64
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that NASDAQ is roughly at 13 240 and	561.06	6.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	here the peak of NASDAQ was around	565.2	4.319
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	fifteen thousand so still according to	567.48	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	me there is a good 15 gain to be made on	569.519	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	NASDAQ what is the reason for that so	571.92	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	what is the underlying composition of	573.959	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	NASDAQ it is primarily tech stocks take	575.64	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	a look at Apple's profit take a look at	578.279	3.601
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Google's profit take a look at where	580.14	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	they are pivoting all these things are	581.88	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	pointing to a healthy Direction that's	584.1	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	what it is part B take a look at all the	585.959	3.721
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	negative things that have happened with	588.42	2.88
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these tech companies there were two	589.68	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	primary concerns with tech companies one	591.3	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	was the valuation concern that these	593.7	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	companies have gone up in value like	595.86	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	anything and their valuations is going	597.42	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to get crushed and that happened a lot	599.22	4.559
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of companies corrected by 50 50 60 60	601.8	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	percent but that phase seems to be over	603.779	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the second key problem with tech	606.6	4.7
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	companies was the massive layoff	608.64	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that indicates that there is some deeper	611.3	3.82
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	trouble with these tech companies that	613.56	3.779
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	meta firing like 10 of its Workforce	615.12	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Google firing like 15 of its Workforce	617.339	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I'm just making these numbers but the	619.68	2.94
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rough estimates were somewhere around	621.3	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these that almost every major tech	622.62	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	company had fired like 10 10 15 15 of	624.66	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	their Tech Force so people were assuming	627.3	3.599
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that there is something going off with	629.22	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these tech companies but nothing of that	630.899	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	sort is getting uncovered it means that	633.18	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this was just a cost optimization	635.459	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	exercise and it did not impact their	637.5	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	project scale or their expansion plans	640.019	4.201
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these companies are very much still	642.06	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	solid companies sitting on massive	644.22	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	balance sheet some stocks which I've	646.38	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	been absolutely bullish about for	648.36	3.479
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	example meta has given like 100 hundred	649.86	3.599
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	percent returns which is absolutely	651.839	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	crazy given the size of the company but	653.459	4.261
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	anyways coming back to the topic that	655.86	3.479
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	should you be considering investing in	657.72	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the U.S stocks the answer is still yes	659.339	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that you can definitely pick some bets	661.5	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	here especially if you have that two	663.899	3.901
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	three year vision and in this bull run	665.76	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	also tech stocks are going to perform	667.8	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	exceedingly well if you are thinking	669.839	3.481
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that okay U.S stocks I don't want to	671.7	3.84
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	invest what are some good big brands	673.32	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that I can invest in India I would still	675.54	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	say that banks are in a decent position	677.64	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I will speak more about them	679.74	3.539
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	subsequently so this brings us to the	681.18	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	fourth prediction that I had done and	683.279	3.541
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	had categorically said this so please	684.72	3.359
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	listen to this now my third key	686.82	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	prediction is that debt heavy company	688.079	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that have given a lot of run up in the	689.94	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	last two years are going to get	692.399	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	corrected quite aggressively so Casey so	694.5	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I have no personal animosity with adani	696.899	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	group or Airtel bharti so these were the	699.0	3.779
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	two companies that I've spoken about let	700.98	3.84
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	us look at their performance some people	702.779	3.781
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	are extremely bullish that these	704.82	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	companies are going to do exceedingly	706.56	2.719
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	well	708.36	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	for example let me take you through the	709.279	4.361
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	adani story so let us pick adani	711.6	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Enterprise and let me show you how much	713.64	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it has fallen by in the last six months	715.2	5.34
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so it has gotten crushed by almost 40 in	716.94	5.399
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the last six months now you would say	720.54	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that okay Supreme Court verdict has come	722.339	4.141
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it has given clean to adani group	724.32	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and everything is great with the company	726.48	5.16
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that no disclosure issues are there no	728.76	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	foreign portfolio investor issues are	731.64	4.319
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there the line of ownership is very	733.68	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	clear everything is good so there is no	735.959	3.901
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	hidden thing or murky thing that is	738.12	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	going on with the firm see I am no one	739.86	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to give anyone a certificate that is not	741.66	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the debate I am trying to enter into I'm	743.64	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	just simply going to ask you two three	745.74	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	basic questions from this point point	747.36	3.719
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	number one why did the adani stocks fall	748.98	4.52
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	most of you would say	751.079	5.101
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Hindenburg said something bad bad stuff	753.5	4.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	about the raniji and these stocks fail	756.18	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	okay if that were the case then why	758.04	5.22
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	haven't the adani stocks gone up exactly	760.38	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to that same point where they were	763.26	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	trading they are still good like 45 50	764.88	5.1
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	trading below their Peak why is that	767.399	4.321
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happening despite a clean chat from	769.98	3.299
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Supreme Court so this is a basic	771.72	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	question that people need to ask from an	773.279	4.201
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Investor's Viewpoint second key point	775.62	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that have you read the fine print of	777.48	4.5

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	don't want to step into like politics	790.38	3.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and all that stuff	792.12	5.219
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so I am not trying to do that but	794.0	4.899
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	honestly I will just leave you with two	797.339	3.901
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	three basic basic things see whenever in	798.899	4.44

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	be tested they work on questions okay	803.339	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	exactly it is so they will investigate	805.68	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	on question front it's not a clean chip	808.2	3.0
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that they have done a complete	810.12	2.7
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	investigation and given someone a clean	811.2	3.72

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	in overseas investment in adani group	822.899	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and pursuing the case could be a journey	825.06	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	without a destination a code appointed	827.579	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	panel said do you think that this is	829.98	3.06

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	explain you finer points about this	836.94	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	report but please do not consider this	838.8	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	report to be a clean Jet and it is	840.899	3.841
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	getting reflected into the market again	842.7	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	if you don't trust it simply ask a	844.74	3.899
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	question that SC expert appointed panel	846.42	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	gave a clean chat so why haven't the	848.639	4.981
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	adani stocks gone up immediately to that	850.98	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	same level as they were previously	853.62	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	trading so that's my simple question	855.48	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	from an investment Viewpoint there is a	857.1	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	lot of layers that needs to be peeled	859.2	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	will not get into that that is not going	861.18	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to be Market related per se but I hope	863.22	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you get the picture that number one	865.26	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	please stay away still from debt heavy	866.82	5.22

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	their Viewpoint ask them logic that's	943.92	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the most important thing that don't	945.54	3.239
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	invest your own hard-earned money	947.16	3.539
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	depending on what other people tell you	948.779	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	right you have to do your own due	950.699	3.241
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	diligence what is the meaning of due	952.139	3.781
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	diligence it means that you are actually	953.94	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	understanding the logic of everyone and	955.92	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	then making your your own call to invest	958.5	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	your own money so anyways the summary	960.54	3.659
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Point here is that I do not feel that	962.459	3.18
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	debt heavy companies are going to do	964.199	3.361
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	well companies like adani stock	965.639	3.481
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	companies like Airtel might struggle	967.56	2.94
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there is a very high chance that they	969.12	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	might struggle so I am staying away for	970.5	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	them I have not built any position on it	972.48	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and I neither plan on building any	974.639	3.181
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	positions on them so with that said	976.26	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	let's move on to the next point so the	977.82	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	next prediction that I had made was that	979.5	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	a lot of startups in India that are	981.12	3.719
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	unicorn for example by juice an academy	982.86	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	they will all try to project	984.839	4.381
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	profitability from this point because	986.76	4.379
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	they are looking to IPO Point number	989.22	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	four is that I feel that editek	991.139	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	companies are going to exhibit	993.3	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	profitability this now interestingly	995.16	5.22
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	baidu's has pushed its IPO plans a lot	997.62	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of hidden things are coming out on	1000.38	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	baidu's business model I don't know	1001.759	4.561
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	again it becomes a very complicated	1004.16	4.919
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	story to explain but wherever you	1006.32	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	constantly see like promoters in the	1009.079	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	news startup Founders in the news for	1010.88	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	all the wrong reason just stay away even	1013.16	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	if they bring the IPO I'm not going to	1015.68	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	invest one rupee in it I'm telling it to	1017.3	4.88
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you point so please don't even approach	1018.8	5.999
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I'm not going to do all that nonsense I	1022.18	4.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	never do such nonsense now do I have	1024.799	3.301
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	personal animosity with a lot of	1026.6	3.479
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	startups no absolutely not there are	1028.1	3.239
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	wonderful startups they are doing	1030.079	3.061
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	wonderful job there are a lot of	1031.339	3.181
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	startups that are just simply playing	1033.14	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the valuation game now I simply do not	1034.52	4.439
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	like companies that play Pure valuation	1036.62	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	game now think about this that there is	1038.959	3.901
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	a company called as BlackRock it is an	1040.88	3.84
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	investor in baijus it owns like one	1042.86	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	percent equity in it it has downgraded	1044.72	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	its investment and cut the evaluation of	1047.36	5.28
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	baijus from 22 billion dollar all the	1049.58	5.219
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	way to 8 billion dollars now think about	1052.64	4.919
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it that baiju's valuation was 22 billion	1054.799	4.981
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	dollars 22 billion now can you imagine	1057.559	4.381
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	how much money is 22 billion just for	1059.78	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	context and I'm just quoting it from	1061.94	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	memory India's education budget is	1063.86	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	roughly 12 to 13 billion dollars so	1066.02	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that's approximately two times that of	1068.48	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	India's education budget that is the	1070.34	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	size of a startup or with valuation of a	1072.02	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	startup should Ubi as an investor or a	1074.24	4.679
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	retail investor when IPOs come at that	1076.94	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	level should you be buying it the short	1078.919	3.841
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	answer is no you should definitely not	1081.26	3.419
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	be buying it I have been one of these	1082.76	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	staunch non-supporters of crazy	1084.679	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	valuations of startup I had made video	1086.48	5.16
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	against zomato paytm all these companies	1088.76	5.039
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	when they came up with crazy valuations	1091.64	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I had purchased zomato once it got	1093.799	4.801
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	massively discounted I have built lot of	1096.26	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	positions now it's in green for me I had	1098.6	4.439
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	been speaking about it quite confidently	1101.12	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	now does that mean that you should also	1103.039	3.181
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	go and invest the short answer is no	1104.78	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	let's see any IPO when it gets launched	1106.22	4.74
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it will go through its Market Discovery	1108.919	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	phase right now I've been very bullish	1110.96	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	on SBI cards and for the last three odd	1113.179	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	months I have been building a lot of	1115.46	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	position already quite in green why is	1116.539	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that the case so let me take you to its	1119.419	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	IPO history so this is where the IPO	1121.4	5.58
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	opened for SBI payments 724 and 2-3	1123.5	4.98
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	months back it was again back at that	1126.98	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	same level after dancing around for	1128.48	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	close to three years so nowadays what is	1130.4	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happening is that these companies goes	1132.38	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	through a price Discovery phase so wait	1134.0	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	for this price Discovery phase to get	1136.34	4.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	over then get into it in good companies	1138.38	5.039
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that you have trust upon right now I am	1140.539	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	not in a position to comment whether	1143.419	3.241
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this startup is good that startup is	1144.919	3.361
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	good it is very very difficult to	1146.66	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	ascertain that as a normal retail	1148.28	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	investor so the next prediction that I	1150.02	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	had made was the fact that mid-gap	1151.76	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stocks are going to do exceedingly well	1153.32	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	midi cap and small cap stocks are going	1155.0	5.22
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to outperform large cap Stocks by a mile	1157.58	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	why am I saying it so let me quickly	1160.22	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	take you to the small cap and mid cap	1161.84	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	index do some index analysis and then I	1163.82	3.719
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	will help you understand some context so	1165.86	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you can see that this is the midi cap	1167.539	4.561
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	index in India and from its top it is	1169.46	5.28
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	trading at roughly 11 discount as of now	1172.1	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and guess what one of my primary	1174.74	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	contributors to my own portfolio had	1176.72	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	been mid cap stocks they have done	1178.7	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	exceptionally well over the last few	1180.679	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	months just for context this is when I	1182.48	4.439
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	had made the video so roughly here and	1184.64	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	even if we did not invest any single	1186.919	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	money after this then also you would	1189.5	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have been approximately at seven percent	1191.78	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	gain but if you chose to invest during	1193.46	5.339
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the fall also in this entire fall your	1196.4	4.019
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	profits would have been crazy so	1198.799	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	approximately on my mid cap portfolio I	1200.419	3.981
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	am sitting on a gain of roughly 18 to 20	1202.46	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	over the last three four months itself	1204.4	4.0
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so now you might say that okay this	1206.78	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rally is over so okay maybe maybe not	1208.4	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	yes Medicap right now is at its all-time	1210.44	5.099
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	high great opportunity to have invested	1213.02	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	five six months back but that does not	1215.539	4.741
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	mean that now is not a good time small	1217.94	4.619
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	caps at this juncture are in a better	1220.28	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	position according to me so I am	1222.559	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	building a lot of positions in small	1224.419	3.421
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	gaps why is that the case let me take	1225.799	3.541
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you through a very quick snippet here	1227.84	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	here is the market performance of small	1229.34	5.52
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	cap compared to nifty 50 during a bull	1231.799	5.281
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	run phase so you will see that whenever	1234.86	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there is a bull run in the market so	1237.08	3.599
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	approximately Market stays sideways for	1238.76	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	70 of the time maybe in a bull run 20 of	1240.679	5.941
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the time and their run 10 of the time so	1243.62	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	what you would notice is that whenever	1246.62	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there is a bull run for example 2003	1248.12	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	sensex or Nifty you can pick either of	1250.4	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the indices it will give approximately	1252.98	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the same performance sensex went up by	1254.6	5.76
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	91 92 percent small cap almost 2X and	1257.0	4.679
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you will see this trend playing out	1260.36	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	except for maybe one or two exceptions	1261.679	4.141
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	here you will always see this trend	1263.78	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	playing out this phase from 2016 to 2018	1265.82	5.16
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	was an anomaly time what was the reason	1268.46	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	for that that there was a small cap	1270.98	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	restructuring that happened that a lot	1272.66	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of mutual funds had to sell their small	1274.28	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	caps as per CV regulations so that	1276.02	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	brought down the evaluation for small	1278.66	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	caps and there was Heavy beating of	1280.34	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	small caps but outside that small caps	1282.26	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have performed wonderfully better	1285.14	4.019
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	compared to Nifty 50s and sex in any	1286.52	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Bull Run so if you want to put little	1289.159	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	bit more risky money consider small cap	1291.44	5.099
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	over adani stock and do like index-based	1294.02	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	investing in order to lower your risk	1296.539	3.841
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	but yes in case you are interested in	1298.28	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	learning more about specific stocks that	1300.38	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I am considering I do present a detailed	1302.419	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	viewpoint on every single thing that I'm	1304.64	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	doing on the member Community tab so you	1306.5	3.539
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	can check it out so now comes the next	1308.6	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	prediction I had given some commentary	1310.039	3.421
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	around Banks so let's quickly listen to	1311.72	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it t at false this is strategy number	1313.46	5.04
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	one I still feel that banks are going to	1315.98	5.1
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	give very good returns in the year 2023	1318.5	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so okay so from a bank point of view	1321.08	3.479
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have we done well it depends on the	1322.88	3.06
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	segments of the banks that you are	1324.559	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	looking at so if you have purchased a	1325.94	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	top tier corporate banks for example	1328.039	5.161
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	HDFC ICICI access so these banks have	1329.96	5.579
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	done okay HDFC hasn't performed as of	1333.2	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	now my bet is that it is going to	1335.539	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	perform from this point on why is that	1337.4	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the case simply because of the fact that	1339.799	5.461
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	fii money is returning and they usually	1341.9	5.639
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	build positions in top tier Banks so	1345.26	4.74
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	from that perspective Banks like HDFC	1347.539	5.041
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Bank codec ICICI Bank they are going to	1350.0	5.1
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	show even better run up ICICI has	1352.58	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	performed better compared to other	1355.1	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	traditional top end Banks now why was	1356.78	4.74
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that the case because ICICI was a legard	1359.179	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stock for the last couple of years on	1361.52	3.0
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the flip side if you look at the other	1363.14	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	segment of the bank for example small	1364.52	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Finance Banks which have been extremely	1366.44	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	bullish on for example these would be	1368.12	3.299
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	something like Ecuador small Finance	1369.86	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these would be a G1 small Finance pnb	1371.419	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	canara bank so all these type of banks	1373.88	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have done really really well over the	1376.039	3.901
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	last six months so over time I will be	1377.9	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	cutting my positions on small Finance	1379.94	3.84
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	bank I have already made very good gains	1381.86	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	in it some of my banks are stuck for	1383.78	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	example avas financiers is one of the	1385.82	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stocks where I have taken heavy beating	1387.919	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it the BET hasn't gone my way as of now	1389.84	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	but the fundamentals look good I would	1392.299	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	continue to hold my stocks for a bit	1394.52	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	unless this situation changes there is	1396.32	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	no reason for me to sell it I do feel	1398.659	3.601
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that these stocks are going to come back	1400.58	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	up so from that perspective I feel that	1402.26	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	going forward from this point what is	1404.659	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	going to happen is that top end banks	1406.58	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	are going to do well it's not as if that	1409.039	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	something like HDFC is going to do badly	1410.78	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	in fact it is very well placed to do a	1412.7	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	very good Rally from this point as per	1415.22	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	my understanding of course I can be	1417.08	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	wrong if your analysis tells you to	1418.76	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	invest please go and do it my analysis	1421.1	4.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	tells me to invest since I have already	1423.62	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	built quite heavy positions I am not	1425.299	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	buying HDFC Bank I'm already in good	1426.98	4.319
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	profits there I'm just waiting for HDFC	1428.96	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Bank to give a breakout and again please	1431.299	5.281
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	go and reread the ITC growth story that	1433.58	5.04
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	ITC has given like massive run up on	1436.58	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	over the last six eight months so	1438.62	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	whenever breakout happens the breakout	1440.539	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happens like crazy you will not be able	1442.52	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to chase it so you need to build	1444.2	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	positions earlier on good stocks and	1445.76	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stay put during the bull run so that is	1448.28	3.18
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	a simple message that I am going to give	1450.08	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you but yes if you are considering	1451.46	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	investing in banking it's a good sector	1453.2	5.099
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to invest even now because fi money is	1455.419	4.74
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	going to come in heavy volume and they	1458.299	3.601
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	are going to build Crazy positions of	1460.159	3.541
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	crazy higher positions in Finance stocks	1461.9	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and that is going to propel the rally	1463.7	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that is my understanding of course I can	1465.44	3.479
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	be off now comes the final prediction	1467.24	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that what Nifty levels can we expect	1468.919	4.981
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	from this point on so here I will tell	1470.84	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you two three things so in the short	1473.9	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	term I see the levels 19500 getting	1475.64	5.519
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	achieved when will this happen if the	1478.46	5.579
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	breakout of 18 800 or the previous High	1481.159	5.281
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	actually sustains so if there's any sort	1484.039	4.441
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of volume there this is the Target that	1486.44	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	we are likely to hit so whatever bulk	1488.48	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	positions I'm going to make from this	1490.76	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	point it will be after 18 800. so this	1492.38	5.279
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	is point one point two is that where do	1495.32	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I see Nifty hitting like at what max	1497.659	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	level do I see Nifty hitting this year	1499.82	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so technical patterns are getting formed	1501.32	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so this is a cup with handle pattern and	1503.48	4.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	if you pick this depth the indicator	1505.64	5.34
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	comes out to be roughly 21 500 levels so	1507.679	5.701
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this is where I see the Nifty going I am	1510.98	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	not going to do heavy selling before	1513.38	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this level is achieved I might do some	1514.88	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Channel trading I might take some swing	1517.46	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	trades depending on the market	1519.5	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	circumstances that thing I will continue	1520.76	5.58
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to do but my core portfolio I am not	1523.46	5.819
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	going to change up until we hit 21 500	1526.34	4.98
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and post that I will reassess the	1529.279	3.78

PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so let me discuss eight Central points	92.28	3.839
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that I want to communicate the First	94.38	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Central Point is the type of investor I	96.119	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	am because many of you would be watching	98.34	3.12
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this video and yeah except this is like	99.84	3.12
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	a mutual fund investor okay so please	101.46	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	understand this point more Point number	102.96	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	one is that I invest most of my money	104.46	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right whatever money goes into the	107.04	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	market in stocks directly in stocks why	108.659	4.381
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is that the case because I am a highly	111.24	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunistic investor I am not the type	113.04	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of a guy who buys and forgets keeps	115.38	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	doing sip unnecessarily never books	117.72	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	profit and all that stuff I do not	120.0	3.299
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	believe in that theory I have made	122.04	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	enough videos around that so my goal	123.299	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	always is to scout for Market	125.46	3.719
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunities and if I find those	126.96	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunities in the mutual fund market	129.179	3.241
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	then I move to the mutual fund Market	130.86	3.599
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	but majority of the time I invest	132.42	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	directly through stocks why directly	134.459	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	through stocks because it is easier for	136.56	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	me to cut my losses or book profits	138.42	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	whenever opportunity presents now that	141.3	3.299
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is something that I've been able to	143.22	3.239
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	successfully do in my mutual fund	144.599	3.841
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	portfolio also I will reveal this point	146.459	3.841
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	also second is that I am a macro	148.44	4.439
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	convection oriented investor what does	150.3	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that mean that simply means that my	152.879	4.201
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	belief is that macroeconomic moves most	154.62	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of the stock market I do believe in	157.08	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fundamental analysis technical analysis	159.0	4.379
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	but for me macroeconomics trumps	160.98	3.839
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	everything that is something that I	163.379	3.181
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	teach on my member Community also to my	164.819	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	students also and that is something that	166.56	3.3
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I keep on preaching that I am a macro	168.3	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investor I look at big bets and I put in	169.86	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	large amount of money behind those bits	172.44	4.379
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	just to give you some context example so	174.66	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this is a video where I purchase Nifty	176.819	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	approximately one year by back this	178.739	3.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	still reflects into my account	180.9	3.119
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	interestingly I am going to sell this	182.04	4.559
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	now right I am going to sell Nifty 50.	184.019	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	but one year ago I was very bullish on	186.599	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	nifty 50 I was seeing massive	188.519	3.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunities I've done that time and	190.08	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	time again be it like idfc first talk	191.879	4.381
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	beat Hindustan Unilever stock bunch of	193.8	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	other different things U.S stocks	196.26	3.3
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	approximately six months back I was	197.76	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	extremely bullish now I don't feel at	199.56	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this juncture that you know what nifty	201.959	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	50 is going to go up at a very fast pace	203.64	5.94
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	by 10 15 I see better and 15 growth	206.099	5.581
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunities in other segments other	209.58	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sectors which I will discuss	211.68	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	subsequently on the video but the point	213.06	4.259
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that I want to drive home is that I am a	215.28	5.039
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	an opportunistic investor B I am a macro	217.319	5.461
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investor and I go after the things that	220.319	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I have conviction on and final point is	222.78	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that I invest most of my money still in	225.0	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	equities My Equity portfolio is much	227.28	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bigger than my mutual fund portfolio how	229.44	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	much is so I'm not going to talk about	231.599	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	how much this that but let me very	233.94	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	quickly take you through my entire	235.799	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund portfolio and here is the	237.36	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	breakdown so just to help you understand	239.519	3.901
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the point more so you can see that some	241.2	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of my biggest bets have been in direct	243.42	5.16
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	nifty 50 or the entire Indian stock	245.519	5.161
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	market which could be sensex or this	248.58	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	could be BSE sensex Index Fund so you	250.68	3.059
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	can see that you know I've invested like	252.659	4.92
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	1.14 CR on one mutual fund only right	253.739	6.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	SMP BSC sensex and this is our overall	257.579	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Index right similarly if you take a look	260.04	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	at some of my biggest bets in mutual	262.26	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund so you'll see Navi nifty 50 50.	264.36	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this is a pure Index Fund uh similarly	266.1	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my third biggest bet would be DSP nifty	268.68	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	50 so this is again a nifty fifty fund	270.78	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	now you'll say you said that you're not	272.759	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	your portfolio is fairly recent so can	274.56	5.28
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you prove it okay so let me show you	277.259	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	first Navi one right so here is Navi one	279.84	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I will go on view transactions and you	281.94	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will see that I started building	284.04	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	positions roughly one year ago on this	285.36	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	similarly if I take you to my earliest	287.88	4.379
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bed and this is a mutual fund where I	290.58	3.059
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	would have built position the earliest	292.259	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so this was also in August of 2021 and	293.639	5.041
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in the last one and a half years the	296.759	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	markets have been sideways but my mutual	298.68	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund portfolio has given roughly 11 and	300.72	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	a half percent so which is a fairly	302.94	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	comprehensive way of beating the market	304.44	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in a way now of course there would be	305.94	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investors who would have made more money	308.16	3.06
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	than me there would have been investors	309.54	3.12
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	who would have lost a lot of money so	311.22	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this is not like a chest thumping thing	312.66	3.479
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I'm simply presenting the data in a very	314.22	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	transparent manner now let me introduce	316.139	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you to some of my other bits for example	318.06	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I have small cap funds so if you check	319.919	4.381
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this for example this was purchased last	322.08	4.619
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	month right in May again if you take a	324.3	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	look at this almost all my small caps	326.699	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	were purchased in me only right and just	329.16	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	slightly maybe before that and similarly	331.38	4.259
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	if I keep showing you even these index	333.6	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	oriented this was purchased in Jan so	335.639	4.021
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the average lifespan of my mutual fund	337.68	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will be less than a year so with that	339.66	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	said what specific strategies have I	341.58	3.839
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	used in terms of nurturing my portfolio	343.44	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so for that let me move to step number	345.419	4.141
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	two or Point number two so Point number	347.759	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	two is that I am a big proponent of	349.56	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	passive investing compared to active	351.72	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing in mutual funds what is the	353.58	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	difference between active investing and	355.62	2.88
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	passive investing let me give you an	357.12	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	example SBI Magnum midi Cap Fund so this	358.5	5.039
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is an actively managed midi Cap Fund so	361.139	4.261
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	why have I purchased an actively managed	363.539	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Medicap small cap I will explain that	365.4	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	subsequently on the video but for that I	367.199	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mean I would want you to notice that hey	369.24	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this amount is lesser compared to like	371.039	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the other big amounts that I've invested	373.8	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so if you just scan through my portfolio	375.72	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	just 1.14 is here right I mean 91 is	377.4	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	here all that stuff so you'll see that	380.039	3.181
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you know roughly five here I have	381.72	3.599
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invested two and a half around has been	383.22	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in pure index only so I'm a net net	385.319	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	index investor when it comes to mutual	387.3	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds so why is that the case so for	389.4	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that let me take you to a very quick	391.38	4.259
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	case study of ICICI Prudential and there	392.94	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	are two three points that I would want	395.639	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you to notice very quick recap what	397.139	5.221
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	passive funds or index funds are versus	399.3	5.64
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	what active funds are so the previous	402.36	5.339
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	example of small cap mid cap that I gave	404.94	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you there what happens is that the	407.699	4.201
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund manager sits and decides	409.56	4.919
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	every day I'm going to buy this	411.9	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	particular stock and then I'm going to	414.479	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sell it you know after a week then I	416.34	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will aggregate new stuffs so what what	418.139	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is the mutual fund manager doing there	420.18	4.139
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so the mutual fund manager is actively	422.22	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	managing the portfolio that kharidi mine	424.319	4.921
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right buying and selling of the stock is	427.02	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	happening quite regularly and the mutual	429.24	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund manager has a lot of discretion of	431.34	4.859
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	what needs to happen in my case the	433.56	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reason why I prefer passive investing or	436.199	4.261
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	index investing when I am going and	438.78	3.479
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing in something like SNP BSE	440.46	4.92
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sensex that's an index nifty 50 is an	442.259	5.821
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	index so here the mutual fund manager	445.38	4.7
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	does not have the discretion	448.08	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that what is it that the mutual fund	450.08	5.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	manager has to buy and sell if nifty 50	452.52	4.799
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stocks are these 50 stocks then the	455.099	4.141
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund manager will have to go and	457.319	4.921
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	buy these 50 stocks only at the day when	459.24	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I am depositing the money so so there	462.24	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	can be t plus 1 t plus 2 depending on	463.86	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the rules but net net the discretion for	465.84	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund manager on passive funds is	468.24	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	very limited to begin with so that is	470.58	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the first reason why I believe my	472.5	3.479
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	narrative more compared to mutual fund	474.24	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	managers narratives and therefore I	475.979	4.201
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	prefer passive funds second credit point	477.9	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is the expense ratio is less so I have	480.18	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to pay less fees also you give mutual	482.22	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund manager right the fund manager does	484.139	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	not have to use his or her brain what to	486.9	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	buy what not to buy you simply need to	488.759	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	go and buy a BSE sensex that's it right	490.62	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so in passive funds so even the expense	493.319	4.861
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	ratio is less third critical reason is	495.84	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that's it I told you that I am an	498.18	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunistic investor what does that	499.919	5.161
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mean that if I feel that market is have	502.08	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reached that point or this fund has	505.08	4.679
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reached its peak I can cut my position	507.3	5.34
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	easily without bearing any losses here	509.759	4.861
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you will see that exit load is zero	512.64	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percent but when it comes to active	514.62	3.659
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual funds the problem happens that	516.3	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	these funds sometimes put one one	518.279	3.841
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percent exit load also if you go and	520.08	3.3
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sell it after six months you will have	522.12	2.279
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to pay us like one or one percent	523.38	2.64
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	penalty right so that becomes like a	524.399	3.181
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	headache and it becomes a problem for me	526.02	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	but I hope I was able to communicate the	527.58	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	point why do I prefer passive investing	529.62	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	more over active investing and whenever	532.08	5.4
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I do passive investing I do it in bulk I	534.12	6.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	take very concrete focused bets I do not	537.48	5.52
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	do sips so I do not run even one single	540.54	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sip so now you might have a natural	543.0	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	response that okay you said that you are	544.62	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	going to sell your nifty 50 when are you	546.48	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	selling I'm selling it very soon right	548.16	3.239
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so I mean literally like hopefully this	550.08	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	week itself when exactly I will make the	551.399	3.421
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	announcements in the member Community	553.68	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stock market students I'll reveal the	554.82	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	entire answer but I'm close to selling	557.459	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it why is that the case let me give you	559.08	4.439
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	a very quick explainer there see this is	560.94	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the technical chart for Nifty 50. we are	563.519	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	looking at at a daily candle let me just	565.74	3.599
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	quickly draw the numbers here right so	567.6	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this would be 18 800 this is the level	569.339	4.981
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that Nifty has recently breached right	571.92	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so for the last two years the Nifty was	574.32	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	dancing in this zone right so I will	576.24	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	draw the line also so this is the line	577.86	5.099
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that you see so this was the zone that	580.14	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	was not getting broken easily right so	582.959	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this was a problem here now Nifty has	584.76	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	broken and it is trading somewhere in	587.04	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this Zone my hypothesis is that as The	588.959	5.101
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Bull Run gets stronger Nifty might move	591.66	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	up right so it might start trading in	594.06	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this room right first it will go to 19	596.1	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	000 that might become the next	598.14	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	resistance Point very difficult to	599.7	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	predict what exactly will be the next	602.1	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	resistance we need to look at more data	603.66	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	for that but for the timing I'm just	605.58	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	explaining you the concept that the next	607.38	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	major resistance Point YB 19000 then it	609.54	4.919
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will become like let's say around 20 000	612.24	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right so these are different different	614.459	4.021
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	layers so this would be Layer Two this	616.56	3.899
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	would be layer three where Nifty would	618.48	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	dance it might dance from here right it	620.459	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	might go a little bit here here and then	623.1	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it might give a breakout here right so	624.839	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this is how the dancing might happen so	626.58	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I am trying to trade these lines and	628.8	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	therefore right now I feel that in nifty	630.66	4.619
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	50 right and this is a very very	633.42	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	important concept here which I am trying	635.279	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to communicate so please listen to this	637.32	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	part carefully that I do not think that	639.0	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in the next one one and a half year	641.1	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Nifty is going to go up aggressively by	642.48	6.12
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	15 without without this is the critical	645.0	6.06
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	part without some of the large gaps	648.6	6.299
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	going up by 25 or midi cap going by 30	651.06	8.279
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	35 40 this is the mid Gap mid cap to	654.899	7.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small cap so this is the bet that I am	659.339	4.801
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	playing right that rather than putting	661.98	5.039
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my money somewhere here I would rotate a	664.14	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	big chunk of the money here in these	667.019	4.141
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	segments which large cap stocks will I	669.0	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	be buying right now which small cap mid	671.16	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap companies I'll be buying which	673.26	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	specific small cap mid cap stocks	674.82	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	directly I will buy how will I design	676.98	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that portfolio when exactly will I be	678.839	4.141
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	booking profit all this stuff I will	680.88	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reveal the answers on the member	682.98	3.479

PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invest an okay amount also in the stock	690.12	4.02

PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	short I am already letting you know that	697.32	4.139
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I am going to move money from here to	699.899	3.541
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	here this is where I am booking profit	701.459	3.901
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	again please go and check my live	703.44	3.899
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing video I had made enough last	705.36	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	year right around this topic of nifty 50	707.339	4.381
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing why it was a bulk buying	709.56	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunity and now I'm simply booking	711.72	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	profits okay so now comes the next point	713.7	2.879
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that okay if you're cutting your	715.5	2.76
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	position nifty 50 do you think that	716.579	3.361
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	nifty 50 is not going to move no of	718.26	2.819
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	course that is going to move so again	719.94	3.12
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	recapping the important point that if	721.079	4.861
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	nifty 50 goes up by 10 then I feel that	723.06	4.92
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in other sectors for example small cap	725.94	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	midi cap some of the large gaps those	727.98	4.919
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	aspects or those assets are going to	730.92	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	move at a much faster rate from this	732.899	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	point of course I can be wrong this is	735.0	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	not a recommendation that you should	736.98	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	also do the same but one key area on	738.779	4.261
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	where I am betting right now is the	741.42	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small cap and that is the reason why and	743.04	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this brings me to 0.3 that that is the	745.14	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reason why I am purchasing a lot of	747.06	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small cap mid caps not only from now but	748.92	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	for the last three months so I can show	751.32	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that to you so for example codec small	753.12	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Cap Fund you will see my transaction	755.519	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	rate right so this is me again if you	757.44	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	take a look at something like HDFC small	759.959	5.94
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap then take a look at this so this	762.66	5.04
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	would again be somewhere in May and	765.899	3.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	since then these funds have already gone	767.7	3.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	up by five five seven seven percent in	769.2	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	value so you might have a natural	771.06	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	question right now should we also invest	772.8	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in small cap midi caps right now is it a	775.32	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	good buying opportunity here see	777.6	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	according to me it is what is the reason	779.04	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	for that very very simple that whenever	781.32	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	a growth Market comes if you are of the	783.24	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opinion that we are in a growth phase	785.519	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right now now if you take a look at the	787.62	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	last three months of fii buying data so	790.2	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	let me show that to you also so here is	792.24	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the fii buying data what about diis net	793.92	4.919
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sellers they have been in May but last	796.62	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	two months or the previous two months	798.839	3.3
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	they were buying right and they have	800.82	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	been buying for the previous five months	802.139	4.861
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	before that so net and net both fiis and	804.48	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diis are getting bullish now when diis	807.0	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	get bullish and on top of that one from	809.7	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my previous videos these diis are	811.98	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	setting on their highest ever cash	814.38	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	positions in the last three to four year	816.12	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right so their cash position is very	818.579	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	high it simply means that as a	821.1	5.16
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percentage of AUM for example if these	822.959	6.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diis or domestic institutional investors	826.26	5.579
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	have let's say 100 crores of AUM then	828.959	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	their cash position might be three	831.839	2.94
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percent right now right so which is	833.339	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fairly High three to four percent and	834.779	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this money is going to get deployed	836.82	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	where more space specifically in small	838.44	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	and mid caps fiis when they buy they	840.6	4.799
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mostly buy large caps it's gonna be	843.12	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reason I I can tell you because fiis	845.399	4.981
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	when they put in money they do a lot of	847.86	5.7
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	hedging right but in small caps the	850.38	5.459
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	problem is that you can't buy direct	853.56	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Hedges it is very difficult to hedge	855.839	3.421
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	your positions there are methods to do	857.519	3.781
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it right indirectly but direct hedging	859.26	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is very difficult to do in directly in	861.3	4.92
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small cap and Medicap stocks but in	864.0	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	large cap stocks you can do that so fii	866.22	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	buying in large caps right so large caps	868.26	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	are also going to move up at least the	870.54	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	undervalued ones and definitely the	872.22	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	entire segment for small and mid caps is	874.32	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	likely to go up now you might have a	876.24	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	natural question that okay which	878.1	3.479
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	specific small cap mid cap I should buy	879.48	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	please listen to the video I will reveal	881.579	3.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that answer also very simple	883.32	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	understanding there and you yourself	885.199	3.58
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will be able to decipher what you need	887.04	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to buy versus not but before going there	888.779	4.141
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	let me cover Point number four the point	890.82	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	number four and I will take you again to	892.92	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my portfolio here is that I would want	895.019	6.021
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you to focus on funds like	897.48	6.18
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	total stock market fund right and then	901.04	4.06
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	there are a couple of more funds that	903.66	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you could scroll through and see so	905.1	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	these were all my U.S bets right so they	906.66	5.1
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mostly invest in the US market all these	909.54	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	different funds I wanted to put my money	911.76	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in the U.S market six months back why	913.98	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	because that was a bulk mine massive	916.62	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bulk buying opportunity there I bet on	918.42	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it huge profits now you'll say that	920.579	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	actually you're not buying direct stocks	922.92	4.859
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in the US I actually maxed out my 250k	924.839	5.761
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	which is the lrs limit to invest in U.S	927.779	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stocks I again made the announcements in	930.6	3.419
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the member Community section regarding	932.519	3.901
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the same I had no other option but to go	934.019	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	via the mutual fund route otherwise I	936.42	3.419
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	would not have gone there now this is	938.339	3.3
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	something that I plan on holding as of	939.839	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	now at least in the short term I don't	941.639	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	see myself selling it but when the	943.32	4.259
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	NASDAQ presents a good opportunity to	945.72	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sell then maybe I'll sell some of these	947.579	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I'm not 100 sure as of now natural	949.38	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	question comes that should we also	951.54	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diversify outside India my advice or	953.16	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this is not a recommendation this is	956.16	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	just a simple advice whatever I have	957.54	3.299
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	done is the simple message that I give	959.16	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to everyone so see diversification is	960.839	3.901
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	very important and one way of	963.18	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diversifying your Holdings is very	964.74	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	simple that remove or at least try to	966.72	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bring down your Geographic risk it is	969.12	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	great Indian economy is growing most of	970.8	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my money is invested in India completely	972.899	4.261
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bullish on it but at the same time as an	974.579	4.801
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investor I need to prepare for all sorts	977.16	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of situations so from that perspective	979.38	4.139
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diversifying my investments outside	981.54	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	India makes a lot of sense right now if	983.519	5.641
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I have 100 rupees in mutual fund Plus	986.1	6.06
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stocks then 80 goes in India right now	989.16	5.7
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right and 20 goes in the U.S going	992.16	5.099
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	forward I am going to somewhat make it	994.86	5.58
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	70 30 right why is that the case bunch	997.259	4.921
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of other different reasons nothing to do	1000.44	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	with like overall macroeconomy but	1002.18	3.659
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	because of the fact that I want to be	1004.1	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	slightly more Tech heavy I don't see	1005.839	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	such opportunities in India lot of talks	1007.94	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that you know Indian IIT industry is	1010.279	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	going to revive bunch of good good stuff	1011.72	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is going to happen but long term I'm not	1013.699	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bullish on Indian I.T industry I want to	1015.56	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	take more bets on Innovative Tech so so	1017.66	3.359
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	from that perspective I will be	1019.639	3.361
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	following this particular split so this	1021.019	3.18
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is my perspective on International	1023.0	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing this is an important point now	1024.199	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you see however you want to diversify if	1026.72	3.239
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you want to do Geographic	1028.88	2.88
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diversification then definitely	1029.959	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing in some International mutual	1031.76	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds so to say makes a little bit of	1033.62	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sense so now comes the next point that	1035.54	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you would have scanned through my mutual	1037.76	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund portfolio and you would not have	1039.319	5.401
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	seen things like Nifty next 50 or large	1041.0	7.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap funds or hybrid funds or flexi cap	1044.72	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds so why is it that I'm not buying	1048.02	3.659
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	all these funds honestly according to me	1049.94	4.619
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I do not believe too much in it why is	1051.679	4.441
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that so let me start the story by	1054.559	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	telling you about large cap actively	1056.12	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	managed funds so here is the data to	1058.28	3.18
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	prove it that whether you look at one	1060.08	2.94
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	year three year five year Benchmark	1061.46	3.839
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	returns four large gaps and you can see	1063.02	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it here what you will notice is that	1065.299	3.901
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	only 11 percent actively manage large	1067.039	5.161
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap mutual funds beat their Benchmark so	1069.2	5.28
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I honestly do not see any point in terms	1072.2	5.04
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of investing in large gap mutual funds	1074.48	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	which are actively managed right that is	1077.24	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	what data what about hybrid fund so what	1078.799	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	are hybrid funds hybrid funds means that	1081.38	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	they can have debt also they can have	1083.539	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Equity also and they when the situation	1085.34	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	arises the mutual fund manager will make	1087.5	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the decision to move money from Equity	1089.48	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to debt and go debt heavy or Equity	1092.0	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	heavy no right so if I want to invest in	1093.74	4.679
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	debt I'll invest in debt if I want to	1096.62	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invest in equity I will invest in equity	1098.419	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	there are times when you should be and	1100.34	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it's very easy to figure out when to	1102.559	3.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invest in debt versus Equity that's not	1103.82	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	a problem for me so therefore I do not	1105.86	4.439
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	have any hybrid funds even from a debt	1107.84	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds perspective that mutual fund	1110.299	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	perspective indexation benefits have	1112.1	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	been done away with so according to me	1113.96	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	there is no difference between debt fund	1115.7	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	wine or investing in fds if I have to	1117.44	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	keep some safe money I would just simply	1119.9	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	do FD over sticking my money in debt	1121.64	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual funds okay so what is the meaning	1123.919	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of nifty next 50. so these are companies	1125.6	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that range in market cap from rank 51st	1127.64	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to 100 so you're not betting on top 50	1130.46	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	companies in India you are somehow like	1132.5	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you know betting on companies 51 200 the	1134.24	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	problem is that there is no logic to	1136.76	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing in it for example I'm going to	1138.26	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	buy the 50 best companies in India nifty	1140.84	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	50 makes sense it's low risk but let's	1142.88	3.539
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	say that some company starts doing some	1144.919	3.181
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	couple of which is a nifty 50 and you	1146.419	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	know some bad reporting comes out and	1148.1	2.819
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bunch of other different problems then	1149.419	3.421
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the market cap will erode and it will	1150.919	4.561
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fall to length like 70. so when the	1152.84	4.92
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	company is sliding down from top 50 to	1155.48	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the next 50 you might catch a lot of	1157.76	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	those type of companies so there is no	1160.28	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	rational to investing because the	1161.96	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opposite rational could also be given	1163.7	3.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that you know what in Nifty next 50	1165.2	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	companies that are climbing up the	1166.9	3.639
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	rankings from let's say some company	1169.1	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	used to rank at 120 then it performed	1170.539	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	really well it jumped to 70th position	1173.0	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so that will become a part of nifteen	1175.039	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	x50 so there is no narrative that I can	1177.08	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	form right and there is no logic I can	1179.179	4.321
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	apply before investing in Nifty next 50.	1181.16	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so there is no logic therefore according	1183.5	3.419
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to me I do not invest even one single	1185.179	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	rupee there now what about flexi cap	1186.919	3.601
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds no flexi caps are what so there	1188.66	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	are large Cap Fund big company small cap	1190.52	5.1
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds midi cap funds now in flexigap the	1192.5	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund manager jumps from large cap to Mid	1195.62	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap to small cap whenever the	1197.48	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunity arises now again I will show	1198.86	4.559
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you the same data here that see right I	1201.32	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mean whether one three five year mark	1203.419	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	flexigap funds do not beat their	1204.98	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Benchmark because active investing is	1206.9	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	just bad in mutual fund opportunistic	1209.299	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing what I'm trying to teach you	1211.58	3.719
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it still makes little bit sense because	1213.02	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	there can be very clear undervalued	1215.299	4.201
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunities that you could sense right	1217.4	5.94
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	if Nifty is at 16 400 500 highest it has	1219.5	5.82
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reached to 18 500 there is a very clear	1223.34	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Gap you could potentially buy it that's	1225.32	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sensible Market timing but trying to	1227.12	4.559
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	time the market on daily basis that's	1229.88	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	impossible and sometimes I feel that	1231.679	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	flexi cap managers try to do that so	1233.72	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	therefore I avoid it now you will say	1235.64	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that okay actually we have never spoken	1237.44	3.479
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	about Medicap small caps this that right	1238.88	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	and suddenly you have become bullish on	1240.919	4.801
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	midi cab and small caps why is that the	1243.26	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	case and why are you picking the active	1245.72	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund route for investing in Medicap	1247.46	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small caps see I have built enough	1249.679	4.021
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	positions on small caps midi caps	1251.66	4.139
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	directly right I will continue to build	1253.7	5.16
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it but I have 810 trusted stocks in my	1255.799	3.801
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	smart	1258.86	2.939
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	portfolio maybe it would be around 15	1259.6	5.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	now so those are my stocks right now if	1261.799	5.221
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I want to build like larger positions	1265.34	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	then what do I need to do now I cannot	1267.02	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	keep on scanning stocks after stocks in	1269.24	4.439
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the small cap category so therefore I am	1271.16	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	taking the active fund route now you say	1273.679	3.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that okay you will pay a lot of	1275.9	2.82
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	commissions and there will be total	1277.039	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	expense ratio would be more you'll have	1278.72	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to lock in exit load would be there so	1280.52	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunistic investment will not work	1282.44	5.099
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so yes 100 agree let's see when small	1284.24	6.059
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap midicap stocks start running they do	1287.539	5.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	not run by 10 10 15 15 they run by 25 30	1290.299	5.281
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right a year so that is what history	1293.26	4.539
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	tells us that in growth Market small and	1295.58	5.16
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	media funds outperform Nifty by almost	1297.799	5.161
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	2x that if Nifty is giving 15 return	1300.74	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Then small and mid caps are going to	1302.96	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	give 30 return now in that if I have to	1304.94	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	pay an expense ratio of let's say one	1307.7	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	one and a half percent that is still	1309.14	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	okay but to manage large cap funds if I	1310.7	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	am paying someone one one and a half	1313.76	3.18
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percent expense ratio it does not make	1315.02	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	any sense so from that perspective I am	1316.94	4.859
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	on Medicap small cap bunch of other	1318.98	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	different reasons probably I'll make a	1321.799	3.421
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	separate video but my narrative right	1323.48	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	now tells me that small and mid caps are	1325.22	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	likely to do well again not a buying	1326.96	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	recommendation from my end please do	1329.179	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	your own due diligence own analysis but	1330.74	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that is what I'm betting on now to	1332.84	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	answer the question that okay why active	1334.88	3.659
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund route that number one I am trying	1336.74	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to time the market and I want to take a	1338.539	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	broad bet on small and mid cap but I do	1340.46	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	not have the time or energy to scout	1342.919	3.601
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	like 100 good stocks in it when it comes	1344.6	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to small and mid gaps it's mostly like	1346.52	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	VC type of portfolio investing that you	1348.5	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	go and invest in like 100 different	1351.02	3.539
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stocks and out of that maybe like five	1352.22	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will become multivathers and they will	1354.559	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	offset the loss that you are having from	1356.419	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	other 90. so that's the philosophy with	1358.039	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	which you need to operate in small cap	1360.14	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	and mid cap so which brings me to the	1362.0	3.659
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	next point that whenever I am investing	1363.86	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my money in mutual funds I have a very	1365.659	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	clear Exit Plan for example when I	1367.82	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invested my money in index funds I had a	1369.919	4.981
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	very clear Exit Plan that credit when it	1372.5	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	hit search previous all-time high I am	1374.9	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	going to book profits and move out of it	1376.82	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	then I am going to reinvest that money	1378.5	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so that was narrative one so my	1380.24	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	narrative number two right now in the	1382.34	3.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	market is that small and mid caps are	1383.96	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	likely to outperform nifty fifty over	1385.7	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the next few years how many that depends	1388.159	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	on the market what exactly the bull run	1390.38	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will comprise of but I have no need to	1392.179	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	book my profits for the next one two	1394.46	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	years in small cap so I'm cool investing	1396.14	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	from that particular perspective but	1398.539	3.601
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	whenever I'm betting on a particular	1400.52	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	narrative I have a very clear Exit Plan	1402.14	3.539
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in mind that okay this is the reason why	1403.94	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I'm entering into it and this is what I	1405.679	3.541
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	feel is going to happen if my narrative	1407.6	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	change then probably I'll book a loss	1409.22	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	and get out of it but have very clear	1410.84	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	exit strategies whenever you are	1412.76	4.799
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	deciding to invest in anything so now	1414.98	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	comes Point number seven that okay why	1417.559	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	are you picking so many different type	1419.48	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of funds that you have purchased HDFC	1421.159	3.9

PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	types of funds okay so let me give you	1428.299	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	counter examples there was a recent scam	1429.98	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	run by access mutual fund managers this	1432.38	4.679
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	was the front running scam what is it it	1434.78	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	was just type of a scam no point in	1437.059	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	getting into all that that what exactly	1438.62	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	was a scam about probably a separate	1440.539	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	video similarly a few years back there	1442.22	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	was a crisis at Franklin Templeton so	1444.5	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that was again a company that used to	1446.72	3.18
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	run mutual fund house so the point that	1448.34	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I'm trying to drive home is that despite	1449.9	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund being a highly regulated	1451.76	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	industry scams keep on happening there	1453.5	4.559
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so just to diversify my risk not go	1455.78	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	through the stress key that in one fund	1458.059	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I built like crazy amount of position	1459.98	2.939
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	then I am stressing out what will happen	1461.299	3.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	with this when will I get my money back	1462.919	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	all that stuff I don't want all that so	1464.6	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	therefore I spread my money that's it	1466.88	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	second key Point many of you when you	1468.559	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invest in a mutual fund you what you do	1471.08	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is that you go on Google type best	1473.539	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual funds to invest and then you will	1475.039	4.981
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	see the returns this one gave X percent	1477.2	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	return lastly near me this one gave five	1480.02	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percent return therefore going in the	1481.94	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	future this fund that was giving like 15	1484.039	4.321
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	return for the last three years will	1486.5	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	continue to give me 15 return for the	1488.36	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	next three years it doesn't work that	1490.34	3.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	way okay just looking at the historic	1491.78	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	returns of a mutual fund does not	1493.7	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	indicate anything about how it's going	1495.74	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to perform in the future the fund	1497.72	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	manager itself can be changed by the	1500.059	5.581
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund house so betting on a fund manager	1501.98	6.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is a very difficult exercise I would say	1505.64	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	just diversify so that's what I'm trying	1508.34	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to do that for example if I have to	1510.38	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invest let's say 10 lakh Rupees in small	1512.24	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap then I would rather invest that 10	1514.159	4.621
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	lakh money in 10 different active mutual	1516.38	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds of a certain size right how to	1518.78	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	pick a good small Cap Fund there are	1520.7	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	certain fundamentals I'm not saying	1522.86	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	randomly that's not the point but there	1524.12	4.799
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	should be some parameters and I'm just	1527.48	3.299
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	encouraging diversification that's the	1528.919	3.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	key message that I want to give now	1530.779	2.821
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	comes the last point that whatever	1532.22	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund you are buying it needs to	1533.6	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	be purchased in context of your	1535.76	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	portfolio so for example what I have	1537.98	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	done is that when it comes to my direct	1540.32	5.099
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stock portfolio I have already maxed out	1542.36	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my position on whatever small caps	1545.419	4.201
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	directly I wanted to buy large cap midi	1547.34	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	caps I directly wanted to buy so now if	1549.62	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I want to build a diversified position	1551.96	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	on small caps and medicaps then my	1553.52	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	option is that now I start picking more	1556.1	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small caps Medical perhaps directly into	1558.14	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my stocks or if my goal is	1560.059	4.561
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diversification then I just simply pick	1562.82	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual funds so the reason why I pick	1564.62	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual funds is very simple that it is	1567.14	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to complement whatever I am doing in the	1569.12	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stock market it does not act as an and	1571.22	5.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	or or kind of a thank you or sir	1573.62	6.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it's highly opportunistic it's more	1577.12	4.539
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	customized it is driven by certain	1579.86	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	thought process certain strategies in	1581.659	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mind these were prominent principles	1583.52	4.62

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	three of them are giving very different	19.02	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	viewpoints about the market so it is	20.58	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	better for us to understand all these	22.56	3.66
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	different perspectives and then design	24.42	4.08

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	spirit with which I'll be shooting this	28.5	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	video and the three investors that I'll	30.0	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	be speaking about would be Mr Vegeta Mr	31.92	5.94
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Mukherjee and Mr Ajay shravastava all	34.62	4.439

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	viewpoints different style important	39.059	4.561
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	point to note is that when it comes to	41.1	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Big investors they do some kind of	43.62	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	hedging for their portfolio for example	45.48	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	they might take some trades in the fno	47.7	4.019
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	market they might be doing profit	49.86	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	booking regularly they might have better	51.719	4.261
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash flows management all these points	53.76	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	are not usually talked about during our	55.98	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	TV interview and we miss these points so	57.84	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	as retail investors it's very important	60.12	4.439
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	for us to hedge our risk and one of the	62.1	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	easiest ways we can hedge our race is by	64.559	4.681

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	will be made free and I will be	86.7	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	uploading that also on our wisdom hatch	88.619	3.601

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	foremost point about Mr Sarah Mukherjee	136.02	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is that he is a growth investor now what	137.879	4.981

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	now if you check Devi's lab and if you	157.2	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	check the fundamentals of the company	159.66	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	then what you would notice is that roce	161.22	6.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is 19.3 it is a zero debt company and	163.98	6.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the revenues profits of the company are	168.0	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	also growing right so this is a good	170.16	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	good company net net now if the	171.78	4.679
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	management is clean other things are in	173.819	5.161
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	order no red flags are there then we	176.459	4.321
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	could categorize it as a fundamentally	178.98	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	strong company so Mr Sora mukherjee's	180.78	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	viewpoint generally while investing is	183.06	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	at least to what I could decode is that	185.22	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	he will pick clean companies he will	187.14	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	pick companies where Roc is growing he	188.879	4.681
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	himself says that I look for companies	191.4	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	where the free cash flow is growing at	193.56	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	15 20 so those are his investment	195.54	4.979
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	parameters and it fits with a classic	198.3	4.92
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	growth investor now that's the good part	200.519	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that you end up picking clean companies	203.22	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	but the bad part is that you end up	205.019	4.261
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	picking them at whatever prices for	207.12	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	example as far as I know Mr Mukherjee	209.28	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	was buying disease lab here also here	211.62	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	also here also here also and he might be	213.239	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying a lot of it and the stock price	215.4	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	corrected by a lot it corrected by 40 45	217.319	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	odd percent now same thing happened with	220.14	5.459
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	HDFC EMC same thing happened with TCS in	222.299	4.621
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fact if you would have been watching my	225.599	3.181
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	videos you would categorically know that	226.92	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I was not buying TCS unless it fell to	228.78	4.92
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	like 3000 when I purchased it in bulk	231.48	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	swung trade it and sold it like around	233.7	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	33 something like that right and I was	235.86	4.799
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	out of the stock now when Nifty fell	238.08	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	again I had purchased bulk Nifty I'm	240.659	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	just sitting on it that's it right so	242.64	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what I'm trying to tell you is not that	244.379	3.061
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you know what my investing style is	246.12	2.82
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	better or my investing style is not	247.44	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	better that is not what I'm trying to do	248.94	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what I'm simply trying to tell you is	251.099	4.321
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that growth investing has certain rows	253.019	6.0
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and it also has a lot of ons that is the	255.42	5.219
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	simple message that you need to take out	259.019	3.481
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	of it and it has reflected in Mr	260.639	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	mukherjee's performance also for example	262.5	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	his PMS scheme performed really badly in	264.54	4.92
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the year 2022. so all these points you	267.06	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	should know and now with that said let	269.46	4.2

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	give you my commentary on that so he	275.4	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	spoke about five key stocks one was	277.32	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Metropolis Health one was divis lab one	279.0	4.919
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	was Dr Lal patlar and then he also ended	281.16	5.28
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	up speaking about Titan and alkyl amines	283.919	4.081
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so let me give you very quick	286.44	3.479
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	perspective there which of these would I	288.0	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	be holding which of them I might be	289.919	4.381
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying more all that right so let me	291.78	4.02

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	point that you need to understand is	300.12	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	let's see these are correlated stocks	301.44	4.259
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what is the meaning of correlated stocks	303.6	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that for example it is like you buying	305.699	5.761

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	exactly the same work the answer is no	313.68	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	but the correlation will be high that in	315.36	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	case you end up investing let's say 10	317.58	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	10 lakh Rupees each in each of these	319.139	4.261
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	three stocks and if the IT industry	321.06	4.32

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	portfolio please note that very very	345.06	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	important point now from the second	346.86	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	point that okay what about like these	349.139	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	three stocks can you do some commentary	351.3	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	okay so let's start with dv's lab only	352.86	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so DB's lab basically what it does is	354.78	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that it manufactures API and it exports	356.94	5.28
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it this is the classification of exports	359.88	4.379
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so you can look at its export to Europe	362.22	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	U.S bunch of other countries what are	364.259	4.561
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	apis apis are called as active	366.78	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	pharmaceutical ingredient these are raw	368.82	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	material from which eventual medicines	371.16	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	are made right so just for the purpose	373.08	5.04
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	of Simplicity now the business depends	375.0	5.639
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	quite extensively on exports	378.12	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	we are unfortunately in the election	380.639	4.021
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	year or almost in the election year not	382.62	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	only in India but 2024 we will see	384.66	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	elections at bunch of different places	387.12	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	across the world during election periods	389.16	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is when the nationalistic sentiments get	391.38	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stirred up every country starts saying	393.6	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that you know what make in India is the	395.58	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	best or make and Russia is the best or	397.259	3.541
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	making China is the best or making us is	399.06	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the best and a bit of import export	400.8	5.16
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	restrictions are put so as a result	403.56	4.259
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	export oriented businesses tend to	405.96	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	suffer right during such times this is	407.819	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	something that might happen with disease	410.28	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lab also this is the primary risk with	412.259	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the stock is it a fundamentally good	414.36	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	company solid company nothing wrong with	416.22	4.319
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the company per se valuations are also	418.319	3.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fine right for example if you take a	420.539	4.201
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	look it is already crashed by 40 45 odd	422.16	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	percent right from here to here it has	424.74	5.28
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	started to go up right here uh will I be	426.84	5.28
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying more the answer is no right so if	430.02	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I take a look at a divis lab I already	432.12	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	have it in my portfolio a little bit but	433.919	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I'm not going to buy it unless I get it	436.08	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	at even more massive discount why is	438.06	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that the case because now you might say	440.16	3.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that you know what akshat this is	441.9	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	already at a discount why are you not	443.34	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying it very simple because I see	444.96	4.139
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	better Market opportunities at this	447.18	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	juncture which are relatively less risky	449.099	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	for me where I can do domestic	451.38	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	consumption play for example if I take a	453.599	4.201
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	look at cards company or if I take a	456.0	3.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	look at insurance company and for	457.8	3.299
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	example many of you might be watching my	459.419	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	videos for a while and you would know	461.099	3.241
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that I have been very bullish on HDFC	462.479	3.421
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	live so that has started to give a	464.34	3.479
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	massive run up so I'm more bullish on	465.9	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	these themes at this juncture this does	467.819	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	not make dv's lab a bad stock for me but	470.22	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I am sitting somewhere in the middle	472.319	3.241
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	where I see better Market opportunities	473.52	4.019
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	right now so I would rather put new	475.56	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	money in something like this this is my	477.539	3.301
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	personal belief my personal opinion	479.28	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Pharma stocks are going to do well	480.84	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	subsequently no doubt about that but if	482.639	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I take a look at PE it's not as if that	484.62	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I'm getting like very cheap PE at this	486.479	3.301
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	juncture this is not even like	488.34	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	pre-covered PE at which I'm getting so	489.78	3.66
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it's not as if that these stocks have	491.699	3.241
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	become like relatively very less	493.44	3.479
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	expensive I had already built some	494.94	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	positions in it I will continue to hold	496.919	3.481
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it someday they are going to go up if I	498.66	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	take one two year viewpoint but putting	500.4	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in new money I will refrain from them	502.56	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	same commentary applies to Dr Lal patla	504.12	4.019
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that had purchased it when it has fallen	506.52	3.119
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	quite a bit built my position now I'm	508.139	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	holding tight little bit of loss here	509.639	3.181
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and there but it's not as if that you	511.199	3.181
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	know what my positions are such that you	512.82	2.88
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	know I will start threading so what	514.38	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	about Metro Health so this is a slightly	515.7	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	different company let me share some	517.44	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	quick data points around it so you'll	519.0	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	see that debt to equity is 27 so debt is	520.74	5.76
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fairly High it is a mid to small cap	523.74	5.46
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	type of a company if you take a look at	526.5	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	its fundamentals right what you will see	529.2	3.66
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is that see sales growth has happened	531.12	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	but profit growth has not happened	532.86	5.22
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	proportionally for example 2019 data if	535.08	6.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you see the sales was at 761 profit was	538.08	6.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	124 but if you check 2022 2023 sales	541.44	5.22
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	have gone up massively but has the	544.86	3.599
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	profits gone up proportionally the	546.66	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	answer is no so this looks like a debt	548.459	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fueled growth I typically avoid such	550.68	3.839
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	companies unless there is a very clear	552.779	3.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	perspective there is a very clear	554.519	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	product Market fit so I am not right now	556.62	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investing in it but how having said this	559.019	4.801
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	small cap medicines right hand small cap	561.3	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Medicap stocks are going to perform	563.82	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	really well so maybe Metro Health will	565.26	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	perform quite good now since I've	567.24	3.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	already built a lot of positions in	568.98	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	other small cap Medicap companies in a	570.48	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	more Diversified manner as you can need	572.339	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in EA that I have to go and invest my	574.26	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	money in like Metro Health and take like	576.06	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	crazy bets on it without any substantial	577.68	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	data so for now I'm not buying Metro	579.66	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Health so now let me talk about two non	581.459	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Pharma picks that Mr Sarah Mukherjee	583.74	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	gave so one was alkala means he's	585.779	3.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	already an investor in it it's a solid	587.64	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	gum so I had a bit of it I sold it I'm	589.62	5.46
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	looking to re-enter it so will I be	592.32	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying it at this juncture let me	595.08	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	quickly discuss that see it's a solid	597.12	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	company I don't even need to take you to	598.68	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	profit margins and all that stuff you	600.42	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	guys are smart enough now very quickly	601.98	4.919
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	let me comment on the valuations the	604.2	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	valuation seems okay at this juncture I	606.899	3.421
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	don't think that there is anything	609.3	3.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	majorly off the stock has already	610.32	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	corrected by 45 it's a Specialty	612.48	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Chemicals play and the recent numbers	614.88	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	are also both in terms of profits and	616.38	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	revenue so netnet it's a good company No	618.42	3.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Doubt about that I will not get into	620.22	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	massive details here what I will simply	621.959	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	leave you with is the fact that by this	624.06	5.04
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	company only when it is around its 200	626.459	7.021
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	dma so this is 200 dma right if you're	629.1	6.179
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	looking to buy now build new possessions	633.48	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	on it it's probably an okay time this	635.279	3.601
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	was a great time to build positions no	637.44	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	doubt about that but now is probably an	638.88	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	okay time I will wait I'm not going to	641.339	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	build my positions immediately on	643.86	3.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	something like alkala means and why	645.48	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	again I explained you earlier that I see	647.399	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	better opportunities in markets	649.68	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	elsewhere so I don't need to necessarily	651.3	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	get into Specialty Chemicals race out of	653.1	4.799
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	now but in case I get like a bulk buying	655.74	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	opportunity I might do it subsequently	657.899	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in the future so that is my commentary	659.76	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	on alkala means but if you want a	661.62	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	diversification if your portfolio is	663.3	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	actually too much Finance too much it is	665.04	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	there all that stuff want to build	667.26	4.259
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	position and Specialty Chemicals good	669.66	3.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stock I think valuations are also	671.519	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	sensible and this juncture unlikely that	673.079	3.661
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you're going to suffer like massive	675.48	3.299
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	losses from this juncture at least it	676.74	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	looks like right now comes the final	678.779	2.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	point	680.1	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	spoke about so this was regarding Titan	681.079	5.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	now Titan is a very interesting story I	683.82	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	have gotten so many queries that should	686.579	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	be by Titan should we not buy Titan so	688.44	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	let me quickly present my analysis there	690.48	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	see Titan is fundamentally a very good	692.22	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	company no problem there but here is the	694.38	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	problem right the problem is the	696.6	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	evaluation and the classic growth	698.1	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investing theory if you are investing in	700.32	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Titan here then you must have a very	702.36	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	clear understanding why Titan will keep	704.04	5.58
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	on going up in prices at a fairly good	706.38	5.519
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	rate okay so for this you need to know a	709.62	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	little bit of History why did the Titans	711.899	5.281
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	prices go up recently one was the	714.3	6.12
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	increase in gold now why what does gold	717.18	5.159
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	prices have to do with Titan okay so	720.42	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Titan is like jewelry maker watchmaker	722.339	5.641
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it holds a lot of gold and the life	725.04	5.039
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cycle of gold is fairly big for example	727.98	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	if you are looking to buy a Titan watch	730.079	5.341
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in 2023 then in order to make that watch	732.0	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Titan would have to start the process	735.42	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	from 2021 it will have to procure gold	737.1	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it will to process gold make watch	739.86	5.52
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	deliver it distribute it Market it and	742.2	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	then finally you will get to buy it	745.38	3.12
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	after one and a half two years so	746.7	3.66
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	there's a fairly long cycle that the	748.5	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	gold procurement for whatever you are	750.36	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	seeing now would have been done in 2021	752.22	5.82
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and that is reflecting in 2023 and how	754.62	5.399
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	much has the gold prices gone up by in	758.04	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the last two years at quite an	760.019	4.801
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	aggressive Pace gold Cycles are fairly	761.82	5.4
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	long term in nature they take like 10 10	764.82	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	years to transpire so please understand	767.22	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that that because a bull run has	769.32	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	happened in Gold Plus the fact that	771.54	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stock market Bull Run is somewhat	774.18	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	happening right now it's very unlikely	775.92	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that gold is also going to run or	777.899	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	continue to run at the same Pace it as	779.7	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it has over the last one and a half	781.62	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	years and this will definitely slow down	783.06	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the growth of Titan this is 0.1 your	785.16	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	second question would be that okay gold	787.44	4.199
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	price are not going up maybe they will	789.54	3.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	be able to increase the product prices	791.639	3.661
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and increase the number of units sold	793.079	4.621
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	yes that might very well happen but	795.3	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	price rise in Titan products has already	797.7	4.139
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	happened quite aggressively over the	799.92	3.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	last one and a half two years why	801.839	3.481
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	because again the price of gold went up	803.459	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so their inventory also benefited and	805.32	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	their pricing strategy also benefited	807.899	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	because let's say they had procured gold	809.76	5.4
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	at let's say 100 rupees a unit in 2021	812.639	5.221
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	right now at the time of selling it what	815.16	4.799
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is the value of that asset or the value	817.86	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that they are holding for example they	819.959	4.201
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	bought like let's say 1000 ton of gold	822.06	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	okay hypothetically speaking I'm picking	824.16	3.859
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	like simpler examples	825.959	4.981
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	they are right right 500 they are left	828.019	6.161
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	with so this also is valued at 2023	830.94	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	prices right so that's one benefit	834.18	5.04
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	second is that the 500 units that they	835.8	5.099
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	have processed for gold they have made	839.22	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	watch out of it for that also they are	840.899	3.12
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	going to increase the price	843.18	2.64
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	proportionally right it's not as if that	844.019	4.021
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you're going to get like gold watch at	845.82	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lower rates compared to what the raw	848.04	3.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	gold prices are so I don't think that	849.66	3.239
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the prices are going to go up quite	851.579	2.88
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	aggressively at least for the next one	852.899	3.781
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	two years but see very recently there	854.459	4.801
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	was a gold price play there was a price	856.68	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	play there was a point play all three	859.26	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	benefited Titan but going forward cryton	861.42	5.52
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is likely to benefit only from qplay not	864.24	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the other two things at least for a	866.94	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	short period so I am not going to invest	868.68	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	my money unless I get this stock at	870.36	5.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	below its 200 day moving average	872.399	6.0
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you will not be able to invest in this	875.899	4.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	ever let it be I'm not bothered right so	878.399	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	there are enough opportunities in the	880.74	3.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	market so I will probably catch those	882.3	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fishes rather than running after this so	883.98	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that is my perspective important points	886.199	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that you need to take away from Mr Sarah	888.36	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	mukherjee's commentary is that he is	889.92	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fully invested in the market 100 he's	892.079	3.541
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying more he's bullish about the	894.18	2.88
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stocks that he had already talked about	895.62	3.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and it looks like that he will continue	897.06	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to make investments in all of these	898.8	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stocks so that is what I could get from	900.42	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	his commentary I'd explain you his pros	902.699	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and cons now you make a call as per your	904.5	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	understanding so now let's move on to	906.66	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the second investor which is Mr Ajay	908.279	3.541
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	shravasta he's not very active on social	910.019	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	media so you might not know about him so	911.82	4.319
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	here is his very quick background so he	914.16	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	has a graduate from I am Bangalore he	916.139	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	had Investment Banking experience he	918.18	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	runs it's a consulting firm right now	919.86	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	has a good portfolio and he has	921.54	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	presented a slightly negative commentary	923.579	4.741
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so let me first read out his three four	925.68	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	statements first statement is that	928.32	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	reality is uglier than what screens are	930.48	5.219
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	showing number two markets have run	933.12	5.399
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	ahead of its fundamentals at this point	935.699	5.76
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Specialty Chemicals PE has gone up to	938.519	6.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	250 to 60. all valid concerns and this	941.459	6.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is absolutely true so his eventual piece	945.42	3.479
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	of advice was that you know what	947.639	3.241
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investors should have a little bit of	948.899	4.021
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash positions and he is not fully	950.88	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	invested in the market he's building his	952.92	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash positions so that is something that	954.42	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investors should consider approaching as	956.699	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	well there are specific sectors where he	958.74	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is bullish there are specific sectors	961.019	3.601
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	where he is bearish so I'll explain	963.12	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	those viewpoints also but very quickly	964.62	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	let me cover the point about building	966.72	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash positions because this is one way	968.579	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in which big investors hedge their	970.5	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	portfolio see there are two types of	972.72	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investors in the market one would be	974.459	4.221
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	your typical mutual fund investors	976.44	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	everyone we are going to put like 10 000	978.68	4.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	rupees and you know x amount of rupees	981.06	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buy and forget never book profit so this	982.92	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is one set of investors okay they are	985.32	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	like buy and forget type they don't make	987.24	3.839
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	huge amount of money to be honest right	989.279	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	compared to second set of slightly more	991.079	4.681
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	intelligent investors which act as per	993.24	5.219
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	opportunities now how can you act as per	995.76	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	opportunity as well you will be able to	998.459	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	do it if you have cash flows so let me	1000.56	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	give you my example so let's say	1002.959	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	hypothetically what I do right now in	1004.459	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the market is that I will be roughly 100	1006.68	5.04
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	invested in the market okay now every	1008.6	5.159
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	month if I'm making a cash flow of 5	1011.72	4.739
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lakh five lakh five lakh right then even	1013.759	5.161
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	if the market goes down I can plug this	1016.459	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash flow here and I will be able to	1018.92	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	downward average it so this allows me to	1021.259	4.741
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	take advantage of more opportunities so	1023.6	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	when people give advice that you know	1026.0	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what you should be away from the market	1027.679	4.201
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	or you should be 80 invested or 20	1029.36	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	invested it all comes down to one single	1031.88	4.559
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	factor which is cash flow what is your	1034.22	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash flow like if you have a good cash	1036.439	4.921
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	flow then you can be 100 invested in the	1038.54	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	market right now for example I am almost	1041.36	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	100 invested in the market right now	1043.22	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	with the understanding that you know	1045.26	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what my cash flows are clear I will be	1047.179	3.541
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	able to make new money and plow it back	1048.919	4.621
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in case the opportunities arises if you	1050.72	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	are of the view care then I am not going	1053.54	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to get a lot of cash flows in the next	1055.16	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	few months then probably it makes tends	1056.6	6.0
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to be 85 90 invested keep 10 money handy	1059.0	6.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	this 10 money should always be handy	1062.6	5.16
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	with you if you don't have cash flows I	1065.419	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	hope I was able to communicate this	1067.76	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	point so this is a fairly important risk	1069.14	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	mitigation point that is adopted by a	1071.36	4.439
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lot of big investors okay so very	1073.7	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	quickly coming back to Mr Desh ravastha	1075.799	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what is he bullish and bearish about so	1077.78	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	let me take you through that so he is	1080.299	5.161
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	bullish about all these different themes	1082.52	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the First theme is bullish about is	1085.46	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	hotels then Airlines then defends	1087.38	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	infrastructure New Age companies do I	1089.6	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	agree no right here why so think about	1091.94	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it this way and I'll explain these	1093.98	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	economics here so it's all our	1095.299	4.561
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	government money spending game right so	1097.28	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	government money spending aim for	1099.86	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	example if the government increases its	1101.36	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	expenditure over the next one one and a	1103.64	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	half years which it is likely to because	1105.62	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it's an election year then of course all	1107.72	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	these industries will go up no doubt	1110.12	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	about that but again what ends up	1111.98	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	happening here is that all these bits	1114.26	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	for you are highly concentrated beds for	1116.0	5.039
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	example if you are investing in a real	1119.12	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	estate also if you are investing in	1121.039	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	hotel companies also you are buying a	1123.08	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	flat also you are buying in defense also	1124.76	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	then what is that single Factor you're	1127.22	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	betting on government spending now if it	1128.72	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	does not meet the market expectation all	1131.24	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	these sectors are not going to rally and	1133.52	3.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you might end up having a very	1135.14	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	concentrated portfolio and you might end	1136.76	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	up taking a lot of hit so please realize	1138.98	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that in my case I'm not investing	1141.74	4.319
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	anything in like real estate companies	1143.96	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	why because I directly invest in real	1146.059	3.061
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	estate I've been doing it for the last	1147.74	2.88
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	one one and a half years I am already	1149.12	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	sitting on like 20 profits on some of my	1150.62	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	real estate investments in less than a	1153.02	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	year why is that because it was a great	1154.94	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	time to swing the real estate in a way	1157.22	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I'm have no intention of selling it it	1158.9	4.019
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	was a good cycle for me so I purchased	1161.12	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it I identify really good investment	1162.919	3.601
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	opportunities and I plan on holding that	1164.6	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	real estate for me that's a cash flow	1166.52	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	game that's not a trading game so	1168.38	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	anyways coming here basically what you	1170.12	3.66
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	would be doing in case you end up	1172.34	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investing in these themes is that you	1173.78	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	would end up exposing your portfolio a	1175.88	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lot to infrastructure which is not a	1178.1	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	very sensible move little bit if you	1180.26	3.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	want to do do it but don't go super	1181.94	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	crazy in terms of these individual	1183.5	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	breaks another way of thinking about it	1185.24	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is that if the capital expenditure picks	1187.46	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	up that banks are also going to disburse	1189.86	4.319
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	more loans that will make it profitable	1192.02	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so if you want to lower your risk then	1194.179	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	probably picking undervalued Banks might	1195.799	4.561
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	make more sense which are undervalued	1198.14	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	banks right now I will create a separate	1200.36	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	list on member Community tab of YouTube	1202.039	3.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	If you are a serious investor you could	1203.96	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	consider joining it I explained all the	1205.88	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	points fundamentally there write out	1208.28	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	everything and give very timely	1210.32	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	information so with that said let me	1211.82	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	explain what he's bearish about and add	1213.679	3.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	my commentary on that so he is bearish	1215.36	5.64
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	about low end retail he is generally you	1217.52	5.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	know bearish about retail companies	1221.0	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fertilizer Commodities so Commodities	1222.94	4.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	100 I had already sort of said last year	1225.14	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that I had sold all my commodity stocks	1227.9	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	commodity is a cycle gold is the only	1229.76	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	commodity that is somewhat performing	1232.46	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	still but all the other Commodities are	1234.38	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	not they're cooling off right so no	1236.539	4.201
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Point here right low end retail I	1238.4	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	completely agree that when it comes to	1240.74	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	these signaling products for example	1243.14	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	when you own an iPhone you will flaunt	1245.24	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it when you own a Mac you might flaunt	1247.039	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it but probably if you own a redmi or a	1248.96	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Dell you might not flaunt it so we are	1251.179	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	quickly reaching that society which is	1253.34	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	status driven so low end retail	1255.08	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	generally from a long-term perspective	1257.24	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	might not be a very sensible move as	1258.799	5.161
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	long-term investors uh I'll not	1261.08	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	commentate here and this I don't know to	1263.96	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	be honest so I'm just letting you know	1265.94	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	right so from this perspective I don't	1267.26	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	know but the key takeaway from Mr Ajay	1269.0	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	srivastav's commentary is that be	1271.28	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	prepared for a market Fall that can	1273.38	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	happen and I 100 agree with me for me	1275.059	4.561
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the way I am mitigating that is by	1277.58	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	managing my cash flows that is something	1279.62	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that I am looking at you can also do	1281.299	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Bond investing as I previously said	1283.64	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that's one way of mitigating risk and	1285.44	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	probably I will come up with a separate	1287.66	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	video on risk hedging strategy now let's	1289.159	3.661
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	move on to the third investor and my	1290.96	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	favorite investor right now which is Mr	1292.82	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Vijay kedia I absolutely love the person	1294.44	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	simply because he's like you know enjoy	1296.84	3.839
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	enjoying life singing zones what not so	1298.34	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you like you know much smaller type so I	1300.679	4.081
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	really love that attitude about his	1302.78	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	style of living life more than anything	1304.76	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	else that's one second key thing if you	1306.679	5.041
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	are trying to emulate Mr Vijay KDs time	1309.08	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	please understand what type of an	1311.72	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investor he is he is a high risk High	1313.46	5.579
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	reward type of an investor now what is	1315.74	4.799
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the meaning of high-risk higher what	1319.039	3.661
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	type of an investor so for that you need	1320.539	4.441
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to understand the VC game or venture	1322.7	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	capitalist game now what our VC does is	1324.98	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that for example a VC would go and	1326.96	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	invest one one lakh rupee in 100	1329.12	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	companies with the understanding that 80	1330.86	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	of them are going to die but the 20 that	1333.44	5.04
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	remains they are going to 10x in size so	1335.96	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	if you run the math you will see here at	1338.48	5.46
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	C company 20 go by 10 so that gives me	1340.22	6.12
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	how much 200 so my 100 unit of	1343.94	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Investments becomes 200 units of	1346.34	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investment despite 80 companies time so	1348.32	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that is Mr Vijay KDs style of investing	1351.02	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	as per my understanding what he does is	1353.0	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that he buys a lot of midi caps small	1355.34	4.819
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cap companies he	1357.38	2.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I buy like companies that are like you	1360.88	5.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	know just starting out so to say they	1364.159	3.181
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	should have the hunger to grow so he	1365.9	2.94
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	uses something called a smile framework	1367.34	2.94
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so I will just put it here what does	1368.84	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that mean so that is his style of	1370.28	4.259
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investing if you have that level of risk	1372.14	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	appetite his style of investing will	1374.539	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	make sense but please understand that	1376.46	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you are playing the VC game do I do that	1378.919	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	yes a fraction of my portfolio is	1381.44	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	designed in such a way for example I had	1383.659	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	purchased zomato I had purchased uipath	1385.88	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I purchased coinbase that part of my	1388.159	4.681
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	portfolio follows Mr Vijay kedia's style	1390.38	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	of investing but majority of my	1392.84	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	portfolio does not follow that so you	1394.58	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	need to contextualize what to pick from	1396.86	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	every investor that is what I am trying	1399.38	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to teach you through this video so what	1401.24	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is his Viewpoint about the market right	1402.98	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	now so he seems to be 100 invested in	1404.6	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the market he has purchased or built his	1406.82	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	position quite early he is neither	1409.22	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying neither selling anything and yeah	1411.38	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so that's what he's doing right so he's	1413.6	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	just relaxing he has said that you know	1415.159	3.541
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what there is time to be activated the	1417.02	3.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	market then there is time to be	1418.7	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	selective in the market and there is	1420.2	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	time to be inactive in the market so	1421.76	3.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	he's somewhat in that inactive stage at	1423.26	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	this juncture that he's not doing	1425.179	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	anything he's just waiting for his seats	1426.62	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to sprout and become like good trees and	1429.14	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	then he will think what to do this story	1430.88	4.679
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	works out greatly for him for example if	1432.799	4.681
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you understand one of his stories which	1435.559	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is called as Sarah sanitaryware so	1437.48	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that's a stock that he picked when it	1439.7	3.599
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	was at three and a half rupees or four	1441.62	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	rupees somewhere in 2003. right now the	1443.299	5.041
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stock trades at 8 000 rupees now if you	1445.94	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	are new to investing you'll say yeah	1448.34	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	great right three and a half maybe	1450.5	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	picked eight thousand right now it's not	1452.36	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	as if that he would have picked that	1454.7	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stock and you slept on it he would have	1455.84	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	selectively booked profit this is	1458.12	3.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	something that he says also that is not	1459.919	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	iBook profit on that stock he would have	1461.36	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	intelligently designed curtailed his	1464.059	4.021
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	portfolio by edging his other bets so	1465.86	4.199
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	how does this entire math moves so let	1468.08	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	me give you very quick commentary there	1470.059	2.761
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so let's say that he invested like 1	1471.44	3.599
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lakh rupee and Sarah Senator ran in 2003	1472.82	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	okay now then there was a bull rally his	1475.039	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	one lakh became what two lakh rupees so	1477.62	3.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what he would have done is that he would	1479.659	3.301
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	have booked like 50 profit he would have	1481.039	3.421
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	kept that one lakh rupee yeah my	1482.96	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	principle is sorted now let me just keep	1484.46	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	this one line rupee intact and Let Me	1486.74	3.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Wait and watch then that Sarah's	1488.72	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	entryway kept on going up up and up so	1490.159	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what that allows you to do is that that	1492.86	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	allows you to witness the downfall and	1494.659	4.621
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	not get paid by he himself goes on to	1497.0	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	say that after every Bull Run ends Sarah	1499.28	6.12
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	sanitary were corrects by 50 to 70 you	1501.98	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cannot stomach that level of volatility	1505.4	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	unless you have booked some profit so	1507.08	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that is his style of investing please	1509.24	4.38

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	has made and which are his biggest bets	1515.96	4.199
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	right now so this is what he has picked	1518.12	5.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	this season so affordable robotics	1520.159	6.9

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	also sold something called as ramco or	1527.059	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Tejas there is no point in me doing this	1528.98	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stock analysis probably I'll make a	1530.96	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	separate small cap mid cap video which	1532.76	4.14

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	overarching Viewpoint that Mr Vijay	1546.14	3.84

wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	These questions keep coming to the minds of all those who invest in the stock market:	6.172	5.756
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	what is the market like today, Is it cheap? Should I invest today or wait for the right time?	11.928	7.299
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	On which stock should I invest apparently?	19.227	3.17
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	How should I benefit from the fluctuation in the stock market?	22.397	5.756
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	I guarantee that this video will be the answer to all these questions.	28.153	5.797
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So I request that you all save this video in your playlist,	33.95	5.13
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	as whenever, in a day, a year, or a decade, you ever get confused about what has to be done in the stock market,	39.08	8.05
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	this video would probably be able to answer all the possible questions, even after 5 decades.	47.13	6.59
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In the previous video, we discussed why we believe it is almost certain that the US economy will experience a recession or slow down,	53.72	10.427
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which will have an impact on the Indian economy.	64.147	5.422
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So when any such negative, or sometimes even positive, news is in the air, how should we think? How should we invest?	69.569	10.511
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	We’ll be learning everything in this video. To understand that, we'll look at a few quotes from Warren Buffett,	80.08	11.511
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	To invest, the world's lesson no. 1 is , and without realising it, you can never create more wealth.	91.591	7.382
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And most of you have already learned Lesson No. 1. But, for some reason that I don't understand and you don't believe,	98.973	6.632
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Lesson No. 1 is that no one knows where the stock market will be the next day, in the next month, or in the next year.	105.605	14.473
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Although it differs in that many social media influencers can easily claim to have a study that will allow them to predict where the market will be tomorrow,	120.078	11.386
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and this prediction for tomorrow, which is one day, is quite long term,	131.464	3.587
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	many people can predict where the market will be in the next hour.	135.051	5.631
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Forget that; you also listen to influencers, news readers and investors with a hope	140.682	8.508
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	that you will get to know where the market is going.	149.19	4.672
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So you should think of a question: When Warren Buffett said that nobody knows,	153.862	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then why do these people tell us every day where the market will go?	160.285	4.504
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The answer is simple: there has to be some news on the channel every day,	164.789	4.213
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and on social media, there has to be some new video uploaded every day.	169.002	4.045
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But when one day you will completely believe the fact that nobody can tell, then you’ll start following the first rule of the investing world:	173.047	11.303
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	in the stock market, only invest the money that you don’t want back in the next five years,	184.35	6.465
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	as in the short run the market is very uncertain.	190.815	3.921
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Now, why have I mentioned a duration of 5 years,	194.736	2.878
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	It’s because Warren Buffett has said this multiple times:	197.614	2.502
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	"I only buy anything from the stock market assuming that the market will shut down the next day and will only open after 5 years."	200.116	10.385
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So after reading about Warren Buffett, I understood two things pretty quickly.	210.501	4.88
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	To begin, there can be a storm of negative or positive news in the stock market at any time and from any location.	215.381	6.549
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Secondly, don’t stress about the ups and downs of the stock market, invest in great businesses, or stocks that can overcome the storm and rise.	221.93	11.553
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But I was always confused about how to find such stocks in the stock market that would not sink in the storm.	233.483	10.969
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So the investors who doesn’t know how to evaluate the companie	244.452	3.545
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and how to read Balance sheet, Income statement, Cash flow statement,	247.997	4.088
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Warran Buffet made the investors understand the same through his letters to shareholders.	252.085	7.465
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Warren Buffett said that "from 1900 until the end of 1999, America witnessed two world wars,	259.55	8.509
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In 1929 saw a great depression, In 1918 faced an epidemic due to covid like flu, High Oil prices, around 12 recessions.	268.059	10.636
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Besides all this, the two index in stock market of USA rose from 66 points in 1900 to 11497 points in 1999.	278.695	14.389
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If we try to understand it in the context of India, if you have no knowledge of the investing world,	293.084	8.342
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	what should you buy in the stock market?How do I invest? You don’t need an extraordinary fund manager or portfolio management service;	301.426	9.509
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	you only have to invest in the Indian economy.	310.935	3.42
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And the most straightforward and correct way to invest in the Indian economy is	314.355	5.005
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	what I have been preaching to India for the past 12 years in both offline and online sessions:	319.36	6.632
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	invest in the Sensex, Nifty, or something similar for the long term.	325.992	6.298
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	for which you can buy index funds like Sensex, Nifty,	332.29	5.172
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and because of you people, we can create a revolution in our country.	337.462	4.129
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In 2010, when I started telling people to invest,	341.591	5.505
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	there was only one way to buy Nifty, which was through Nifty bees,	347.096	6.34
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and its assets under management were not even 1000 crores.	353.436	3.921
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Many people told me that index investing would never be popular in India.	357.357	5.171
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Mutual fund distributors and advisors will never sell index funds,	362.528	4.713
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and mutual fund houses will never promote them.	367.241	3.337
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	We kept working on it for 12 years.	370.578	2.461
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And today, there is hardly any mutual fund house in India that does not offer index funds.	373.039	6.298
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	From even less than 1000 to 2000 cr asset under management to more than 2.5 lakh crore is invested in index funds in India.	379.337	9.885
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Not only that, but we ran a long campaign in the BSF for around 2.5 lac jawans and officers under BSF DG KK Sharma Sir to invest in Index.	389.222	14.973
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And we continue to spread knowledge in the Army, Air Force, and many other organisations today.	404.195	7.132
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In addition, EPFO has decided to invest in Sensex and Nifty funds since 2015.	411.327	10.385
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And today, in Sec 80 C tax saving fund, that is ELSS, has also started launching the Nifty Index Fund.	421.712	7.883
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Those who’ve started walking along with me on the path of the index fund,	429.595	3.546
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	please drop a yes in the comment section so that we can popularise it in India.	433.141	9.676
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	For those who haven't grasped the concept of investing,	442.817	4.463
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	I'll summarise it in one minute and then we'll move on.	447.28	4.796
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So when you buy Nifty funds, you indirectly invest in the top 50 companies in Nifty.	452.076	7.633
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Companies with poor performance will have their weightage in the Index reduced.	459.709	5.338
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And if its performance gets worse, it drops out of the index.	465.047	4.672
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Companies that are not included in the index will be added if they perform well.	469.719	8.592
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	You don’t have to think of anything. You don’t have to change anything in the portfolio.	478.311	5.964
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	For those who believe that historical data is very important,	484.275	3.42
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	I want to tell them that in 1979,  Sensex,Whose base value was set to 100 has today reached to 60,000 after 42-43 years, which is an increase by 600 times.	487.695	13.972
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And this 600 times increment is the birth right of every Indian.	501.667	7.049
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In these 42-43 years, India faced a lot of problems	508.716	4.129
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	like Economic crisis in 1991, Harshad Mehta scam, Kargil War, Demonetization, US Housing crisis, Indian Banking Crisis, Covid Lockdown, everything.	512.845	11.845
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But it reached from hundred to sixty thousand.	524.69	3.963
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	As a result, many people are sceptical that investing in the index should be done blindly.	528.653	8.925
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	This is a complete misinterpretation of Warren Buffett’s teachings.	537.578	3.796
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Let me take those who understand the fundamentals of index investing to Warren Buffett's Lesson No. 2	541.374	8.091
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	so they can understand when the market is cheap or expensive.	549.465	4.838
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The lesson no. 2 is hidden in Warren Buffett Sir’s quote,	554.303	4.546
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	he says, "I will tell you how to become rich in the stock market." Be fearful when others are greedy. "Be greedy when others are fearful."	558.849	10.094
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Over here, he claims that when markets rise exponentially and the economy's future appears bright, many people make a lot of money.	568.943	9.76
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Then people become very greedy after seeing the past performance of the stock market and start investing a lot of money.	578.703	8.258
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The market becomes very expensive, so you've got to be fearful before investing.	586.961	7.799
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And when the economy is facing a huge blunder, everybody believes that the future is uncertain or very poor, then nobody invests.	594.76	8.843
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	You should invest aggressively if there is fear in the market and the market falls.	603.603	6.256
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The biggest problem with this quote is figuring out when the market is fearful, and when it is greedy, which means when it is cheap or expensive.	609.859	10.385
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So in the last few decades, I’ve made many ways for myself to find it out.	620.244	6.09
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And in March 2020, Nifty was at 8000. There was a lot of fear in the market, so I tried to teach a few ways out of it in this video	626.334	9.259
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and tell it was time to put everything on the market.Since then, the market has grown by more than 100% in three years.	635.593	9.176
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Remember that we can’t even tell how much more the market will fall, when it will rise, which means we can’t tell the time.	644.769	7.966
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But we could, and we were telling you that the market has become cheap,	652.735	5.172
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and because we can't tell the time, we took a 5-year horizon,	657.907	5.63
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	so watch this video; even now, you'll learn a lot from it.	663.537	5.714
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If I have to teach an investor who knows nothing about market timing how to use the MCAP to GDP ratio,	669.251	13.472
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	I generally suggest they use it because Warren Buffett Sir has talked about it a lot,	682.723	3.963
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and those who've seen my 4 hour free awareness programme must've heard of it.	686.686	7.257
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Market cap means the market value of all the stocks listed in the stock market,	693.943	4.713
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means the value of the complete stock market, and GDP means the final value of all goods and services produced in the country,	698.656	8.05
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which in turn means the amount of goods produced by all the companies and people combined.	706.706	6.381
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So first try to understand why all of us, the followers of Warren Buffett, believe that the stock market increases as much as the GDP in the long term.	713.087	9.217
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The increase in GDP means that the companies are producing more.	722.304	3.838
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If the companies are producing more, it means they are selling more. If they are selling more, they will make more profit in long term.	726.142	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If the profit increases, the stock price will also increase in the long term.	732.565	4.129
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Furthermore, as GDP rises, so will market capitalization, as measured by stock market value.	736.694	6.798
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And according to me, in normal circumstances, the ratio of market cap to GDP in the Indian context is around 1.	743.492	11.303
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Sometimes stock prices increase a lot as people find the future quite positive.	754.795	6.382
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Then the stock market value exceeds the value of the GDP.	761.177	4.296
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And this ratio increases to 1.4–1.5 or even more.	765.473	5.088
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Then you need to understand that the market has become expensive; it has exceeded the GDP.	770.561	6.215
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Thus, it either has to fall or wait until the GDP value increases.	776.776	5.714
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And sometimes, because of market fear, it falls to such an extent that the ratio becomes 0.5,	782.49	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means the stock market value becomes much less than the GDP.	788.913	4.504
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Then you might say that the market has become cheap.	793.417	4.213
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	On March 24, 2020, when we made this video and stated that it was time to put all of the energy into the market,	797.63	7.799
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	among other things, I stated that the MCAP to GDP ratio had reached 0.5.	805.429	7.841
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Now, what is the ratio of MCAP to GDP and what has to be done accordingly, We’ll be discussing that by the end of the video.	813.27	7.508
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	However, if you believe it is very confusing or difficult to implement, Warren Buffett Sir makes investing easier	820.778	8.842
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	because knowing all of this and putting it into action are two different things.	829.62	5.714
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	When the economy is in bad shape and there is a lot of bad news, it is difficult to put all of your efforts into it.	835.334	8.926
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And for the amount of emotional control and behavioural change that is required,	844.26	4.296
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	one has to listen to Warren Buffett’s teaching for years.	848.556	5.797
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Thus, Warren Buffett can make even the most inexperienced investor understand how to invest in a single sentence.	854.353	9.927
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	He claims that a novice investor can outperform (do better than) most investment professionals by investing in index funds on a regular basis.	864.28	10.719
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	By "periodic investment," he means to say that you invest through a SIP,	874.999	5.547
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means you fix an amount for each month and keep investing.	880.546	4.671
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	so that you don’t make the mistake of investing at the top of a one time market.	885.217	5.714
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And if you keep investing every month for a long time, sometimes on top and sometimes on bottom,	890.931	6.507
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then your buying price will be the average of the high prices and the low prices.	897.438	6.298
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And if you buy Nifty at an average price, nobody can stop you from earning the market return, which is every Indian’s birth right.	903.736	12.554
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Warren Buffett also tells you where to do SIP: in index funds,	916.29	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	the Nifty 50 index, or the Nifty 500	922.713	6.965
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In the Nifty 500 Instead of the top 50 companies, the top 500 companies are included .	929.678	5.714
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	However, there are few options in India for investing in the Nifty 500,	935.392	6.048
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	but there will be many in the next 1-2 years.	941.44	4.087
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	He also claims that if you invest in an index fund like the Nifty 50 through a systematic investment plan (SIP),	945.527	7.466
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	your return will be above average; in fact, you will outperform many investment professionals.	952.993	8.884
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And I am sharing that data with you all.	961.877	4.088
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So if you go to any website like Value Search to check the performance of India’s oldest fund to invest in Nifty, which is Niftybees,	965.965	9.676
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	remember that Niftybees just replicates the performance of the Nifty 50 index.	975.641	7.382
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So here we see, how the performance of Niftybees compares to the remaining large cap, which means the mutual funds that come in that category.	983.023	11.929
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In the last one year, this category had 124 funds, and if you had bought Nifty,	994.952	6.59
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	your rank in the funds would have been 32nd,	1001.542	3.253
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means you would’ve left 92 well educated fund managers behind.	1004.795	4.713
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In Percentage, you would’ve done better than 74% funds.	1009.508	4.004
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And if in the last 3 years you held Nifty,  then your rank would have been 16th out of 102 funds,	1013.512	6.673
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means you would’ve left behind nearly 86 funds.	1020.185	3.838
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	It would have ranked 12th in 83 funds after 5 years. And in 10 years, in 56 funds, its rank would’ve been 16th.	1024.023	8.341
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And keep in mind that in ten years, some funds will have closed due to poor performance or will have merged with others.	1032.364	9.218
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Your rank will still be 16th in the remaining 56 funds, which are worth the business.	1041.582	6.548
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Think about how simple it is to beat such large fund managers,	1048.13	5.005
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	but we are still incapable of accomplishing such a simple task.	1053.135	4.129
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Warren Buffett sir teaches the same thing in his quote.	1057.264	3.587
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	He says, "There is an idiotic human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult."	1060.851	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Let’s understand how we make easy things so difficult.	1067.274	4.671
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	You say that after 10 years, Nifty has the 16th rank, which is good,	1071.945	4.255
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	but let's find out what the first 15 funds are.	1076.2	2.919
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Many people analyse the market by looking at past performance to look for the best funds.	1079.119	5.923
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Although it's mentioned in the fund documents as well that past performance does not guarantee future performance.	1085.042	5.881
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Then also you buy those best funds.	1090.923	2.586
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And you must have noticed it many times that these funds were waiting for you	1093.509	5.589
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	as when you buy, its performance drops.	1099.098	4.295
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And when you try to switch to some other funds,	1103.393	4.422
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	if you make a profit, you'll have to pay taxes on it as well, known as the long-term capital gain tax.	1107.815	9.592
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	someday, any of your friends, agents, or advisors might tell you,	1117.407	6.424
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	"Look, my funds or my stocks are performing so well in the Nifty;	1123.831	3.378
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	why are you stuck in the Index?" And looking at their higher return, you’ll not be able to tolerate the pain in your chest.	1127.209	7.799
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And the explanation of this pain is mentioned in the holy book of Warren Buffett.	1135.008	4.839
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	He says that when any of your friends' IQs are 20–30 points lower than yours and they earn more than you,	1139.847	7.59
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then no pain is bigger than the pain you feel.	1147.437	5.464
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Just remember that investing is not a 100-meter race where you keep  noticing who is behind us or ahead of us.	1152.901	8.884
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	It’s more like a marathon, where if you keep moving forward using the right investment strategy,	1161.785	5.798
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	you might find people lying on the track who were once ahead of you.	1167.583	5.839
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If someone tells you that their return is more than their return,	1173.422	4.88
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	to control your pain, please show them this article from Forbes titled	1178.302	4.337
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Any monkey can beat the markets,	1182.639	2.962
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	please show them this article from Forbes According to this article, in 1973,	1185.601	4.254
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Princeton University professor Burton Malkiel wrote in his book that even if a monkey with its eyes closed selects stocks from a financial newspaper,	1189.855	13.805
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	the performance of those stocks will be equal to that of experts.	1203.66	3.045
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	People said this is a lie, then an experiment happened and monkeys were asked to make portfolios.	1206.705	8.217
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	When the results came in, people found that Malkeil was wrong,	1214.922	4.587
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	the performance of stocks chosen by monkeys beat the performance of stocks chosen by experts.	1219.509	6.59
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Now, will you give money to those monkeys to manage?	1226.099	4.713
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In the same way, if anyone beats the index today, there are so many funds, one of them will beat it.	1230.812	7.216
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In the long run, finding out the same thing is simple;	1238.028	3.67
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	saying that today is as difficult as predicting which monkey will beat the expert.	1241.698	9.593
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So many of you will say that, okay, it's clear that, in the form of a SIP, you need to invest every month in an Nifty index fund.	1251.291	9.176
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But we should start the SIP only when the market value drops.	1260.467	5.214
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So whenever any such thought hits your mind that you’ll only start investing when the value drops,	1265.681	6.464
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	remember the quote by Peter Lynch in which he said,	1272.145	3.838
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	"More money is lost in the anticipation of the fall than the fall itself,"	1275.983	5.088
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means that just because you keep waiting for the market to fall	1281.071	3.378
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and you don’t invest,	1284.449	1.377
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	you basically don’t even make the money that you could’ve made by investing in the long term.	1285.826	7.174
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Remember that the investors who keep waiting for the right time are more at a  loss than the long term investors due to the market's fall.	1293.0	11.011
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	As mostly when the market falls, it impacts so negatively that it's hard to gather the courage to invest again.	1304.011	8.049
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And let me share a data explaining to why you should not really wait to invest in SIP.	1312.06	6.674
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The most controversial topic in the world of investment is t	1318.734	5.338
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	That how much return does Nifty give.	1324.072	2.503
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	My first answer will be that it depends on from which date are you calculating	1326.575	5.213
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	as if you check the return from the bottom, you’ll find it more.	1331.788	5.005
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If you check the returns from the top, you’ll find it less.	1336.793	4.213
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Now why do we say that we assume 15% return in long term,	1341.006	4.671
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	I’ve given a detailed explanation in the video.	1345.677	3.17
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	As in India, the very first time when the method to invest in Nifty was introduced in January’2002	1348.847	6.465
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	so let me bring the data from there itself.	1355.312	2.002
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	On 30th January 2002 the value of Nifty was 1067 and now after this Adani news the value dropped to 17500.	1357.314	12.304
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	so if I calculate the annual return from last 21 years then it is 14.25%	1369.618	6.214
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	but it doesn’t give you the complete picture as the dividend that declares the companies under Nifty is not calculated in it.	1375.832	8.634
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So, to get the clear picture of it, it’s better to check the return of TRI Index,	1384.466	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	that is Total Return Index, in which the dividend is also added.	1390.889	5.255
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So, the value of Nifty TRI Index was 1159 on 30th Jan 2002	1396.144	6.882
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and now it is 25000 after 21 years.	1403.026	3.879
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Thus the actual return is 15.8% but remember whenever the market will fall,	1406.905	6.59
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then the return also does. And as when the market rises, the return also increases by 15%.	1413.495	5.881
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Now check the data to understand why it is not required to wait to start an SIP.	1419.376	5.464
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If you would’ve started an SIP 15 years back in Jan 2008 when the Nifty value was 6000,	1424.84	9.926
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	after which the market fell by more than 50%,	1434.766	2.795
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then your annual return of the SIP would’ve been 12.46% that we can see on the site of value research.	1437.561	7.757
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And if you would’ve started an SIP in Jan 2009 when the market value dropped from 6000 to 3000,	1445.318	8.259
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then in 14 years, the return in SIP would be 12.58%,	1453.577	5.797
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means you start from the bottom or from the peak, it remains the same.	1459.374	5.547
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If you find it less then remember that Nifty return increases with GDP.	1464.921	6.298
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Since Covid, there was a negligible growth in GDP so even if the market grows in future,	1471.219	6.298
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The market will correct itself in future.	1477.517	4.88
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If you’re a know nothing investor and you want to get benefitted from the ups and downs of the market	1482.397	5.255
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then you can focus on the ratio of Mcap and GDP.	1487.652	3.921
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Today  the ratio of Mcap/GDP in India is around 1,	1491.573	5.464
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means the market is neither cheap nor expensive and we can’t even predict if the market will be expensive first or cheap.	1497.037	8.717
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But if it gets cheaper then invest as much as possible,	1505.754	4.212
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	like we did in March’2020.	1509.966	3.254
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But if I would have been at your place, I would’ve started an SIP in Nifty Index	1513.22	5.588
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and as the ratio of Mcap/GDP would become 0.5, then I would’ve increased the amount invested in SIP	1518.808	8.134
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and you would’ve got the return even more than market return.	1526.942	5.171
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So according to me, stop watching the stock market news on TV and the views of social media influencers.	1532.113	8.05
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Either start reading Warren Buffett or start an SIP in Nifty Index fund.	1540.163	7.174

ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Focus the primary differences between Tesla and Neo really come down to the user experience	217.99	5.87
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	vertical integration offerings and Battery Technology Neo has really focused on building	223.86	5.11
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	an ecosystem for its customers with Benefits such as Neo houses free battery swaps and	228.97	5.829
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	more Neo has built a strong sense of community around its product and its brand the company	234.799	5.371
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	has hired popular Chinese singers Norwegian DJs and more to bring in customers to sell	240.17	5.58
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	more cars both of these are iconic electric vehicle companies and they have cult followings	245.75	5.67
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and I'd be willing to bet that you've already picked a horse in the race before you watch	251.42	3.94
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	this video I encourage you to try to keep an open mind and understand that I'm simply	255.36	4.61
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	trying to provide facts and Analysis to help you with your investing decision in the end	259.97	5.22
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	the decision of course is ultimately up to you many people would argue that Neo's lower	265.19	4.92
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	end models focus more on quality in that it's more of a luxury maker of course both make	270.11	5.2
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	higher end cars but some would argue that Neo is more focused on the quality of all	275.31	4.55
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	of their products and all of their models Neo also focuses is on battery swapping technology	279.86	5.2
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	as well as battery as a service you can lease batteries from Neo so you can buy a car that	285.06	4.75
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	doesn't have a battery and of course that makes the car less expensive and it provides	289.81	4.16
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	benefits to the owner if the battery goes out prematurely they're covered did you know	293.97	5.09
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	that Tesla wants planned to do battery swapping stations itself but it abandoned the idea	299.06	5.26
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	for fast charging stations their supercharger Network are you curious as to why I'll get	304.32	5.27
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	to that soon and don't get me wrong there are tremendous benefits of battery swapping	309.59	3.97
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	technology especially at the new swapping stations where you can swap a battery in three	313.56	3.98
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and a half minutes but will that approach work everywhere and at what cost I'll break	317.54	4.56
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	that down later Tesla is more vertically integrated and continues to press the envelope in that	322.1	4.9
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	area Neo relies on subcontractors to manufacture its cars whereas Tesla is focused on manufacturing	327.0	6.59
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	the vehicle from top to bottom which increases margins Tesla even acts as a fabulous Semiconductor	333.59	5.919
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Company so like an Nvidia or AMD where they design ships and they send those off to foundries	339.509	5.301
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	to get manufactured Tesla designs both its FSD and Dojo chips in-house using IP cores	344.81	6.17
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and Eda and things like this really can drive the bottom line and really increase margins	350.98	5.18
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and profitability Tesla even offers Insurance to their customers and it's always looking	356.16	4.5
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	to expand its integration as well with talks of lithium Mining and more vertical integration	360.66	5.47
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and complete control of manufacturing has its perks especially in the United States	366.13	4.73
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and remember a lot of people like to compare pricing and Neo often has an advantage in	370.86	4.57
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	that area but it really depends on where you live for example Chinese Imports to the US	375.43	5.91
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	currently have a 25 Duty and Neo has discussed building a factory on U.S soil to avoid most	381.34	6.41
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	of those fees more on this later when I discuss the United States specifically so as we discussed	387.75	5.539
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Tesla is more vertically integrated but it also has more offerings Tesla offers solar	393.289	4.69
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	roofs solar panels power Walls and More I call Tesla a green energy conglomerate and	397.979	5.531
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	they're working on many areas and they're really focused on AI even talking about building	403.51	4.28
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	a robot called Optimus swap both Neo and Tesla do have an AI Focus I would consider Tesla	407.79	6.61
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	the leader of the two when you think of artificial intelligence and many of you I know disagree	414.4	5.19
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	so I'd love to hear from you in the comments below this will also be controversial but	419.59	4.03
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	many people believe that Tesla at least historically has had Superior Battery Technology but Neo	423.62	6.85
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	has been making huge strides in this area in fact the 2023 et7 has a range of up to	430.47	6.75
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	a thousand kilometers that's over 621 miles so next I want to provide some insights regarding	437.22	6.78
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Neo expanding here to the United States first let's discuss battery life in cold weather	444.0	5.879
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	now this is going to ruffle a lot of feathers but hear me out I live in a colder climate	449.879	4.171
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	I'm in the north central part of the United States and I have lots of friends and family	454.05	4.35
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	who own Teslas as well as other electric vehicles the fact is coal cold weather impacts range	458.4	5.85
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	significantly and it doesn't matter if it's a Tesla or a Neo and I know some of you are	464.25	4.62
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	watching this shaking your head right now and you don't believe me fact current EV Battery	468.87	4.53
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	tech loses 50 percent up to 50 percent off ranges in freezing temperatures now when I	473.4	5.07
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	talk about freezing I'm talking about very cold so hold on this is a problem that's not	478.47	4.439
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	discussed and needs to be fixed and I do think that disruption needs to happen when you think	482.909	4.471
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	of Battery tech so of course I get a response funny I've been through three harsh Winters	487.38	3.95
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	in New York with my model Y and I barely noticed any loss if anything 10 can't speak for other	491.33	5.19
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	manufacturers but I'm sick about hearing this false information it's not false it's just	496.52	4.45
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	not as cold there and you're likely not driving long ranges so you don't notice one of our	500.97	5.0
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	members in our Discord Community his name is Derek he is a huge Tesla fan a huge Elon	505.97	5.949
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Musk fan what's up Derek he just bought a brand new Tesla and he experiences 50 losses	511.919	5.841
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	in extreme coal he even talked about it himself on a podcast when this video is done and there's	517.76	4.94
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	a link below and go check that out and here's another reply tests were run on a bunch of	522.7	4.3
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	different brands Tesla's lost 15 and I reply this supports what we've already discussed	527.0	5.01
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	the tests are not run in midwest winter temperatures I'm talking about extreme cold and these tests	532.01	5.97
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	are not doing that these tests are for EVS comparing temperatures to 70 degrees Fahrenheit	537.98	5.7
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	to 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit 20 to 30 is not what I'm discussing here as a quick example	543.68	5.599
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Minneapolis experiences 20 plus calendar days that are below zero degrees Fahrenheit this	549.279	5.641
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	is where that mileage drops off fast and I know with certainty I've got viewers right	554.92	4.57
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	now in Nordic Nations Norway Iceland Sweden Denmark Finland and you're probably ridging	559.49	5.92
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	right now your countries have the highest EV adoption in the world and it's not even	565.41	4.97
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	close but please let me give you some perspective let's use the number one country Norway Norway	570.38	5.64
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	has 81 EVS per 1K residence and that was in 2020 so that number is higher now the United	576.02	6.8
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	States is about 30 times larger than Norway and so when you think about visiting family	582.82	5.25
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	here in the Midwest my wife is from Montana and sometimes we drive 1200 miles just to	588.07	5.709
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	go visit family that's something that you might not experience in European countries	593.779	4.501
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	especially if you're in a country like Norway Norway is really the perfect place for EVS	598.28	4.88
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	if you think about it over 83 percent of the population lives in cities so these people	603.16	4.98
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	drive very short ranges to work and so on they're not driving across several States	608.14	4.819
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	or countries now the United States has around 80 percent of people living in cities as well	612.959	4.401
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and EVS definitely are a great fit especially if you live in the city and you're not driving	617.36	4.31
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	long distances it makes sense but the United States has 332 million people and Norway has	621.67	5.94
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	5.4 million people so that means the United States has 56.4 million people living in rural	627.61	6.37
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	areas the entire country of Norway only has 5.4 million people so we have 10 times more	633.98	4.97
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	people than that just in rural areas here in the U.S and to give you perspective Norway	638.95	4.18
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	has about 918 000 people that live in rural areas but the United States is massive in	643.13	5.889
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	comparison when you think of land mass and it has a huge and complicated interstate highway	649.019	5.041
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	system so oftentimes even Urban dwellers are driving pretty far to get to work they might	654.06	4.86
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	live in tier three suburbs and have to drive over an hour each way to get to work so really	658.92	4.06
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	when you compare the US EV Market versus say Norway it's really apples and oranges and	662.98	5.38
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	I'm not trying to say anything bad about EVS whatsoever so hold on the reason I'm sharing	668.36	4.49
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	this the point behind it is to really get to the core of why Neo is going to have challenges	672.85	4.56
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	in the United States and really battery swapping will not work remember Tesla already tried	677.41	5.38
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	it battery swapping will not work in the United States for several reasons including the size	682.79	5.62
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	the massive size of the US it's rural areas as well as that cold Northern climate that	688.41	5.17
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	we discussed and this will probably also upset a few viewers but this is fact if Neo does	693.58	5.49
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	come to America and you buy a Neo many owners are going to find themselves charging their	699.07	5.19
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Neo electric vehicle at a Tesla supercharging station so if you're not aware Neo doesn't	704.26	5.31
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	have to use battery swapping stations you can charge the battery as well but their Battery	709.57	4.94
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	tech is not focused on that and keep in mind that not all Tesla charging stations are open	714.51	5.42
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	to non-testinal vehicles yet Tesla has a massive charging Network infrastructure in the United	719.93	5.34
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	States as well as globally Tesla has over 17 000 charging stations in the US which can	725.27	6.17
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	add up to 320 miles of range in 15 minutes and that's according to the company's website	731.44	5.5
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Tesla's charging Network especially in the United States is unparalleled unrivaled and	736.94	5.54
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	nearly impossible to penetrate and I'll explain why to provide some perspective on this Tesla's	742.48	5.68
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	superchargers cost one-fifth of the competition to build as low as thirty thousand dollars	748.16	5.869
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	per charger where most of the competition is asking for 150 000 a charger and in some	754.029	5.781
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	cases two hundred thousand dollars per charge larger that's five to seven times the price	759.81	5.38
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	this goes back to that vertical integration and first mover Advantage especially in the	765.19	4.6
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	US if you remember on the previous video this is a follow-up to a video that it did on Neo	769.79	4.87
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	battery swapping stations cost about five hundred thousand dollars to build now the	774.66	4.33
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	new ones are two hundred fifty thousand dollars plus it costs a million dollars a year to	778.99	4.96
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	maintain one the cost the time and the scale to build out a battery swap Network in the	783.95	5.27
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	United States it's an impossible challenge now I get questions a lot about should I invest	789.22	5.06
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	in chargepoint or EV go so these are the type of companies that Tesla has been competing	794.28	4.559
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	on and they're trying to charge 150 000 per station versus 30 000 from Tesla nobody even	798.839	5.681
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	comes close to Tesla on these prices and Tesla already knows that battery swapping won't	804.52	5.259
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	work in the United States remember they tried it already they went down that path and they	809.779	4.541
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	realized pretty quickly that battery swapping was not the answer in the US for some perspective	814.32	5.269
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	here Tesla can build 16 superchargers stations for every single Neo battery swap station	819.589	6.081
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	now for the new models it would be six or seven superchargers to one but this doesn't	825.67	4.51
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	even go down the rabbit hole of relationships contracts and the amount of years invested	830.18	4.969
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	to build out this infrastructure if you really dig into this the task is absolutely daunting	835.149	5.281
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and remember what's good and what's convenient for you as a buyer a consumer someone that	840.43	4.62
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	owns the vehicle it doesn't always correlate well to what's good for investors so you might	845.05	5.18
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	love the car but we're talking about this from an investor perspective which stocks	850.23	4.68
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	should you buy now hold on because I'm not done yet and you might be surprised at my	854.91	4.36
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	final answer but if you were to ask me which EV should I buy if I'm in the United States	859.27	5.03
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	the answer would be Tesla and it's really not even close and I'm talking about all of	864.3	3.93

ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and it's gonna be really hard for anybody to come close to it it really is and I'm not	873.25	3.959
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	even gonna go down the rabbit hole of AI and what it's going to take for other companies	877.209	4.021
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	like Ford and GM them to come close when you think about Thomas driving now I do think	881.23	3.81
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	that Neo is strong in this area so I give them credit for that so absolutely there is	885.04	5.68
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	competition and it's a threat for both Neo and Tesla these Legacy automakers are spending	890.72	5.35
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	billions of dollars to try to get a piece of that EV pie and don't get me wrong I know	896.07	4.41
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	that Neo and Tesla both have cult followings and some of you are probably upset watching	900.48	4.479
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	this but this analysis does provide great perspective from the U.S market specifically	904.959	5.281
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	so as an investor if you're invested in Neo right now I'd be careful what you ask for	910.24	4.39
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	building a factory in the United States think about the obstacles it's going to face remember	914.63	4.75
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Neo does not have the experience that Elon Musk and Tesla does when you think of manufacturing	919.38	4.819
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and Neo is not vertically integrated watch this quick clip from Elon Musk I lived in	924.199	4.551
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	the Fremont and Nevada factories for three years fixing the the production line running	928.75	6.889
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	around like a maniac through every part of that factory living with the team I stepped	935.639	5.651
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	on the floor so that this the team who was going through a hard time could see me on	941.29	6.989
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	the floor uh that they knew that I was not in some Ivory Tower whatever pain they experienced	948.279	8.331
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	I was I had it more so	956.61	9.899
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Chinese and that's really if you think about why Neo products are cheaper it comes down	966.509	4.13
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	to the labor costs and those higher wages are going to eat into margins even worse than	970.639	4.19
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	we've already seen with some of their margin compression so when you see articles about	974.829	3.631
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	how Neo is cheaper it's really not a good comparison because those stats are using prices	978.46	5.21
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	with Chinese labor they're not real costs in the U.S so you can build a factory here	983.67	4.96
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and avoid the 25 duty but then pay a lot more for labor or you can get cheap labor and pay	988.63	5.47
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	the 25 Duty no matter how you slice it Tesla is going to have the advantage here when you	994.1	4.51
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	think of margins and again this is specifically the United States and if you buy a Neo in	998.61	4.729
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	the U.S you're probably going to be using a Tesla Supercharger to charge it let that	1003.339	4.55
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	sink in [Music]	1007.889	3.381
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	[Music] okay hold on be patient here I'm trying to give you perspective I'm trying to be honest	1011.27	9.78
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and I am doing everything I can to be neutral but that information there was simply fact	1021.05	4.35
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	about the U.S market with all that said China is the largest ev Market in the world so I'm	1025.4	6.16
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	not saying that you shouldn't buy Neo stock just because of the US I'm simply providing	1031.56	4.95
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	insights to the US market because it's where I live and it's what I understand the most	1036.51	4.48
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and a lot of the viewers that are watching this you're not on U.S soil and you might	1040.99	3.48
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	not have those insights and another fact here that's probably going to ruffle feathers but	1044.47	3.829
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	again it's fact many Americans will not want to buy a Chinese car or invest in a Chinese	1048.299	4.791
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	company I'm not saying all and I'm not saying that Neo couldn't do well in the United States	1053.09	4.03
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	but I think if they're trying to build out their whole ecosystem they're going to have	1057.12	2.91
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	challenges so Neo would have to be selective and build out their Network and select cities	1060.03	4.33
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	in larger cities like Los Angeles New York Chicago but they would not have an ecosystem	1064.36	5.67
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	that would span the entire us like Tesla which would give them a disadvantage and I'm not	1070.03	5.19
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	here to upset you I'm really not I'm here to provide facts for investors but let's keep	1075.22	5.23
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	digging because I have not gotten to my final conclusion my verdict you're going to want	1080.45	3.98
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	to see it is it possible to own both of these stocks and make money let's find out next	1084.43	6.26
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	let's break down financials and delivery metrics then I'll give you my verdict and tell you	1090.69	4.55
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	which stock you should own all right so this is pretty cool I put this together for you	1095.24	3.68
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	comparing the two companies it has Revenue it has deliveries on the left Tesla the right	1098.92	4.9
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Neo so if you look at Q4 Revenue compare Tesla had 24.32 billion dollars in Revenue that	1103.82	6.17
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	was up 37.2 percent year over year Neo had revenue of 2.33 billion dollars that was up	1109.99	5.68
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	62 percent year over year but it missed by 230 million dollars and Tesla was in line	1115.67	4.72
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	for EPS of course Tesla's profitable it actually beat by eight cents with a dollar nineteen	1120.39	5.22
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	in EPS whereas Neo is negative 44 cents and it missed by 21 cents and the big thing here	1125.61	5.61
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	is margins as I told you in the last video you look at Tesla they had 25.9 margins Neo	1131.22	5.7
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	only 6.8 percent and that was down big from 20.9 in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 16.4	1136.92	8.46
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	percent in the third quarter of 2022. so a significant decline in margins and they're	1145.38	4.601
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	going to to have to get those margins back up electric vehicles sold this is total for	1149.981	4.318
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	2022 this is sold Tesla sold 1.3 million Vehicles up 40 percent year over year Neo sold 122	1154.299	7.901
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	486 up 34 year over year Revenue 81.5 billion up 51 for Tesla Neo 7.14 billion of 36 so	1162.2	10.57
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	you can see that Neo is much smaller but they're really in different stages because Neo is	1172.77	4.32
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	a much younger company and you can see the Q4 delivery numbers on your screen now we	1177.09	4.13
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	just got breaking news for both of these companies just today yesterday q1 2023 deliveries so	1181.22	7.21
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Tesla had 422 875 it actually missed slightly from expectations but it was up 36 percent	1188.43	7.56
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	year over year and they had production of 440 808. for Neo it came in at 31 041 and	1195.99	6.35
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	their estimate was between 31 and 33k this is down 20 sequentially so you're seeing both	1202.34	5.73
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	margin compression and a decline in deliveries for Neo all right this will be really helpful	1208.07	4.96
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	I'm going to compare these side by side you can see Tesla's trading at 195 Neo at about	1213.03	5.72
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	983. 52-week performance Tesla is down 42 percent Neo's down 50 a lot of you might be	1218.75	6.44
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	surprised to see that earnings per share TTM Tesla 362 Neo negative one dollar and one	1225.19	6.68
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	cent and revenue 81.5 billion for Tesla 6.5 billion for Neo market cap Tesla of course	1231.87	5.9
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	much larger 656 billion dollars versus 17.6 billion for Neo earnings for share growth	1237.77	6.72
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Tesla positive 56 Neo negative 28 and as you can see Tesla's cash flow growth for the last	1244.49	6.929
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	three and five years has been really impressive so here's your long-term debt and Equity Tesla	1251.419	4.921
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	on the left Neo on the right pause your screen if you need to price the sales ratio Tesla	1256.34	4.44
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	is actually much more expensive at an eight Neo at 2.67 now since Tesla is profitable	1260.78	5.78
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	it has a PEG ratio and it's expensive 4.85 and so Tesla currently has around a 53 p e	1266.56	5.78
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	ratio next year's estimate 37.9 and Price to Book Tesla's almost a 15 and Neo is just	1272.34	6.69
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	over a four so in conclusion what's the better stock to buy now and what's the better stock	1279.03	4.87
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	to own long term when I compare Tesla and Neo I really think about how each company	1283.9	5.02
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	are in different stages of their life cycle for Neo it's hard not to focus on their cash	1288.92	5.27
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	burn they're really burning a ton of cash to sell cars and build out their ecosystem	1294.19	4.8
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	but that could pay off long term Tesla on the other hand does very little it doesn't	1298.99	4.7
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	really advertise but yet they still sell cars for some perspective on this Neo has 375 Neo	1303.69	6.969
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	houses and Neo spaces and 141 cities as well as 1300 of their battery swapping stations	1310.659	6.721
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and remember what's great for you as a consumer is not always great for you as an investor	1317.38	5.32
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	when money was flowing and it was cheap when interest rates were low growth stocks were	1322.7	4.17
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	in high demand and investors flooded into names like vessel and Neo and these stocks	1326.87	4.66
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	got pushed to nose bleed prices way ahead of themselves in the pandemic and both of	1331.53	4.759
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	these companies do have risks to consider including competition raw material costs supply	1336.289	5.381
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	chain disruptions regulations product liability claims product defects user adoption of EVs	1341.67	7.129
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and more for Neo specifically I think of cash burn decelerating growth highly impacted margins	1348.799	6.051
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and in truth less investors wanting to own Chinese stocks for Tesla you have some of	1354.85	4.89
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	the same concerns but the primary one that really sticks out to me is Elon musk's erratic	1359.74	5.15
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Behavior which some people just don't like and this has impacted Tesla's reputation especially	1364.89	6.019
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	when you think about the whole Twitter soap opera on the positive side for Tesla Elon	1370.909	4.721
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Musk does have 133.5 million followers on Twitter and he could really use that platform	1375.63	5.59
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	to advertise for free across the globe you also have to consider the inflation reduction	1381.22	4.97
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	act which includes tax incentives for U.S buyers and then you think of of margins that	1386.19	4.54
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	vertical integration price Cuts recently to compete cyber truck on the way semi trucks	1390.73	5.04
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	on the way and more and for Neo it has an excellent customer ecosystem and the company's	1395.77	4.66
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	expanding the 25 total countries and regions by 2025. it's also looking to be profitable	1400.43	5.8
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	as soon as next year remember it's a Tesla 16 years to become profitable and Neo was	1406.23	5.319
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	founded in 2014 so profitability by 2024 assuming that happens would only be 10 years which	1411.549	7.461
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	is six years faster than it took Tesla to reach profitability now this could be looked	1419.01	4.4
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	at as a pro or a con but Neo had 136 percent year-over-year increase in r d research and	1423.41	6.69
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	development and this is for advancements in technology to stay up with the competition	1430.1	4.39
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	as well as offer more perks for its customers so it's a pro and a con because it is more	1434.49	5.37
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	cash burn but it's also growing the business for the future Neo is also projecting 250	1439.86	6.26
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	000 sales in 2023 which seems unlikely can considering their deliveries for this quarter	1446.12	5.39
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	were Thirty One Thousand but that's what they're telling us and it's possible plus Neo has	1451.51	4.14
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	several new models on the way and the company's really doing a lot of exciting things in fact	1455.65	4.8
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	there are many reasons to be excited about both Tesla and Neo although of course both	1460.45	5.19
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	do carry risks that you need to consider as an investor I want to share one last stat	1465.64	4.7
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	comparison here before I share my verdict net income per employee Tesla makes over ninety	1470.34	5.76
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	eight thousand dollars in net income per one employee Neo has a cash burn of over a hundred	1476.1	6.29
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	and six thousand dollars per employee so positive 98 000 versus negative 106 000 and this speaks	1482.39	6.86
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	volumes in terms of where each of these companies are within that life cycle we think of a growth	1489.25	5.26
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	stock it starts as a Spec stock goes to hyper growth and growth mature growth and so on	1494.51	5.38
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	Neo is a younger company and it's experiencing a lot of the same Growing Pains that Tesla	1499.89	4.289
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	already went through so this is really going to depend on your risk tolerance how young	1504.179	3.86
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	you are your time Horizon and so on if I were personally to pick one stock it would be Tesla	1508.039	6.091
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	but I do believe that Neo is something to consider for long-term investors who have	1514.13	4.86
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	a healthy risk appetite there's a chance that Neo can be profitable next year and Tesla	1518.99	4.53
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	struggled as well and faced bankruptcy several times so it's not fair to rule Neo out and	1523.52	5.409
ixdDPjF_WoI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdDPjF_WoI	when you think about other U.S companies like lucid and rivien Neo is much more established	1528.929	4.75

mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the YouTube algorithm let's begin	80.34	3.9
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	we begin with the raw material and	82.439	3.661
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	understandably everything starts with	84.24	3.96
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the money that we deposit in a bank this	86.1	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	money goes into a savings account or a	88.2	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	current account or a term deposit and	90.6	3.6
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the bank is expected to pay us an	92.58	3.359
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	interest on this which is why this money	94.2	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	is stacked as liabilities in the banks	95.939	4.741
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	according records now Indian banks have	98.46	4.08
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	seen a tremendous growth in deposits	100.68	3.96
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	over the last two decades and what was	102.54	4.86
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	just 8.5 lakh crores in the year 2000	104.64	5.64
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	has multiplied by almost 20 times in	107.4	5.219
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	these last 22 years amongst the banks	110.28	4.08
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the big daddies of course the State Bank	112.619	4.381
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	of India but what's interesting is how	114.36	5.16
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	htfc bank has not only come a lot closer	117.0	5.159
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	to SBI but has also left behind many of	119.52	4.919
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	its private peers like icic and access	122.159	5.28
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bank so when analyzing Banks deposit	124.439	4.981
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	growth is a key number and as an	127.439	3.361
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	investor you will want to give	129.42	3.899
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	preference to those Banks those deposits	130.8	4.019
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	are growing faster than the industry	133.319	4.081
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	average but this deposit number cannot	134.819	5.101
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	be looked in isolation in fact an	137.4	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	understanding of where this money is	139.92	4.319
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	coming from has a large bearing on the	141.78	4.319
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	profitability and therefore our	144.239	4.14
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	valuation of the bank and for this we	146.099	4.021
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	have to study what is called the Kasa	148.379	4.321
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	ratio Casa stands for current account	150.12	4.8
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	and savings account and the casa ratio	152.7	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	is the money in these accounts as a	154.92	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	percentage of the total deposit for	157.08	5.159
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	example HDFC Bank in March of 2022 had a	159.12	5.58
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	total deposit base of 15.5 lakh crore	162.239	5.761
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	now of this number about 7.5 lakh crores	164.7	5.28
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	were in current and savings account	168.0	4.92
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	which puts HDFC bank's Casa ratio at	169.98	5.58
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	48.2 percent other prominent banks are	172.92	5.76
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	also within the same 42 to 48 range with	175.56	5.34
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the notable exception of kotak Mahindra	178.68	4.02
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bank which is at a cost of 60 percent	180.9	4.8
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	but a number like 60 percent need not	182.7	5.399
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	imply that kotak's book is better to	185.7	3.899
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	prove a point and I'm sure you would	188.099	3.661
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	have observed that Banks like equitas	189.599	4.801
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bandhan and idfc first have been	191.76	4.559
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	enticing depositors with high interest	194.4	4.08
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	rates on their savings account it's a	196.319	3.481
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	strategy that might be helping them	198.48	3.66
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	build their deposit book faster and	199.8	4.859
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	visibly that Casa is also high but there	202.14	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	are still two problems with this firstly	204.659	3.66
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the casa is high because their interest	206.34	4.08
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	rates are high and this money can easily	208.319	4.081
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	vanish when they normalize the interest	210.42	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	rate or if an aggressive competitor	212.4	4.8
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	comes along secondly this customer base	214.62	5.94
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	is not made of many small depositors but	217.2	5.16
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	it is built around a few wealthy	220.56	3.959
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	customers in Casa terms this is called	222.36	4.739
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	granularity and the more granular the	224.519	4.681
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	more subdivided the customer base is the	227.099	4.801
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	better it is for instance HDFC bank and	229.2	4.56
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	ICICI Bank is where a lot of the salary	231.9	4.559
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	accounts are I mean exhibit a is	233.76	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	actually me and I have changed six jobs	236.459	4.801
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	in India and wherever I went it was	238.5	5.58
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	either HDFC or an ICICI Bank salary	241.26	5.58
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	account in fact the most granular Casa	244.08	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	in the country is with the State Bank of	246.84	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	India which holds the salary account of	248.76	3.899
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	most government employees in that	251.04	4.86
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	context I would say a 48 Casa at HDFC or	252.659	6.54
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	ICICI and even a 45 percent at SBI might	255.9	5.76
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	be better or at least on par with a 60	259.199	4.621
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Casa ratio at kotak bank	261.66	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the question is why am I talking so much	263.82	4.92
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	about Casa well a high Casa ratio is	266.04	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	another way of saying that the bank has	268.74	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	access to funds at a very low cost you	270.36	4.559
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	see Banks usually don't pay any interest	273.0	3.72
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	on current accounts and the interest	274.919	4.141
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	that's paid on our savings account is	276.72	3.9
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	particularly low which means for an	279.06	3.78
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	established Bank its cost of fund should	280.62	3.9
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	be in the three to four percent range	282.84	4.079
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	with some allowances made for the	284.52	4.679
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	interest rate regime in our country so	286.919	4.441
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	to sum this up the higher and the more	289.199	5.041
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	granular the casa ratio is the lower is	291.36	4.98
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the cost of funds which in turn can	294.24	4.8
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	boost up the profitability of that bank	296.34	4.799
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the other side of deposits are the	299.04	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	advances or loans given by a bank to	301.139	4.201

mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	focuses on has a big bearing on the	386.039	3.78
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	yield and the risk of its assets	388.139	4.201
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	portfolio and this is something we'll be	389.819	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	talking throughout this video now when	392.34	3.72
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	we look at the loan book for each of the	394.199	3.961
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	banks we see private Banks having a much	396.06	4.02
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	larger Focus towards retail but what I	398.16	3.599
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	want you to understand is why access	400.08	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bank had a mere 20 000 crores of retail	401.759	5.28
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	loans in 2010 which is obviously a lot	404.58	5.52
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	higher now you see until 2010 access was	407.039	5.641
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	not really a retail player but once that	410.1	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bank realized that retail lending has	412.68	5.04
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	much less delinquency it has a low loss	414.78	5.1
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	rate and that it provides is a lot more	417.72	3.72
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	stability to the balance sheet access	419.88	4.319
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	also hopped on the retail bandwagon and	421.44	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	have grown the retail loan book by 15	424.199	4.141
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	times the last 10 years in fact the	426.06	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	issue with corporate loans is that it is	428.34	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	quite lumpy that is a single entity can	430.5	4.86
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	be holding anywhere from 100 to 10 000	433.02	4.98
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	crores and if one such loan goes bad	435.36	4.679
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	then it can make a big dent in the	438.0	4.259
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bank's profitability additionally the	440.039	3.72
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bigger the loan the lower are the	442.259	3.481
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	margins and that's because the borrower	443.759	3.541
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	is definitely going to shop around and	445.74	3.84
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	negotiate for a better interest rate on	447.3	4.14
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the other hand retail customers that are	449.58	4.559
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	spread across lacks of people don't have	451.44	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the ability to negotiate Prime rates	454.139	4.201
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	from Banks they don't fall into	456.12	4.799
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	repayment problems at the same time and	458.34	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	overall the default rate is lower than	460.919	4.201
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	corporates now Banks like the State Bank	462.72	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	of India and other PSU Banks do a lot of	465.12	4.979
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	corporate lending because a there often	467.46	4.92
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	comes a government mandate and these	470.099	4.201
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	banks have to follow it and secondly	472.38	3.84
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	corporate lending does not require as	474.3	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	much effort as retail where one needs to	476.22	3.96
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	set up collection centers build	478.62	3.66
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	technology invest in call centers Etc	480.18	4.98
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Okay so we've discussed deposits and	482.28	5.16
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	we've discussed loans and what banks get	485.16	4.319
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	out of this borrowing and letting	487.44	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	activity is the net interest income in	489.479	4.981
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	simple words the net interest income is	492.18	3.48
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the difference between the interest	494.46	3.54
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	income a bank earns from its lending	495.66	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	activities and the interest it pays out	498.0	4.979
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	to the depositors a derivative of nii	500.16	4.92
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	and a more commonly used term is the net	502.979	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	interest margin which provides a better	505.08	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	visibility into the profitability of a	507.419	4.8
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bank for example SBI is net interest	509.28	5.819
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	income for FY 22 was 1 lakh 20 000	512.219	5.94
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	crores while HDFC bank's nii was about	515.099	4.921
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	three-fifth of that but from a nym	518.159	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	perspective SBI was a 3.1 percent while	520.02	5.22
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	htfc Bank scored a 3.9 percent which	522.599	4.561
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	partly explains how these two variables	525.24	3.599
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	can change from bank to bank depending	527.16	3.78
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	on the type of deposits they have which	528.839	3.841
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	is retail versus corporates the interest	530.94	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	paid as in SBI versus equitas or bandan	532.68	5.58
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Bank the casa ratio the types of loans	535.62	5.7
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	offered has incorporate retail home loan	538.26	5.519
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	or credit cards the asset quality Etc	541.32	4.92
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Point Blank the Nim is an important	543.779	4.201
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	number and the higher this number is the	546.24	3.719
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	better it is now some banks will have a	547.98	3.84
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	name of over four percent While most	549.959	3.241
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	others are between three and four	551.82	3.78
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	anything less than three percent should	553.2	4.86
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	be considered as a soft red flag and	555.6	4.02
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	should be generally avoided by customers	558.06	4.14
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	so essentially banks that do more of	559.62	4.92
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	retail have a higher Nim but that	562.2	3.96
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	doesn't mean a bank should avoid	564.54	3.78
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	corporate and do only retail and in fact	566.16	4.08
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	most banks strive to find a balance	568.32	4.019
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	between the two but as far as investors	570.24	3.779
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	are concerned one needs to carefully	572.339	3.841
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	track the Nim on a quarter on quarter	574.019	4.621
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	basis and if there is any fall in that	576.18	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	number then make it a point to attend	578.64	4.199
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the next earnings call of the bank to	580.8	4.08
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	understand what happened and what is the	582.839	4.201
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	management really doing about it	584.88	4.139
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	all right we now look at the risk	587.04	3.9
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	variables of a banking business which is	589.019	3.721
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the single boost factor that will make	590.94	4.14
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	or break a bank the first variable to	592.74	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	look at is the bank's Capital adequacy	595.08	4.08
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	ratio which is measure of its Financial	597.24	4.08

mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	account the bank's capital and risk	601.32	3.72
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	weighted assets and although this	603.6	4.08
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	formula looks scary all it is trying to	605.04	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	tell us is if the bank has enough	607.68	4.8
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	cushion to absorb a reasonable amount of	609.72	5.22

mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Banks including psus are right now	627.6	4.679
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	sufficiently capitalized but this was	629.88	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	not always the case and Indian banks	632.279	4.081
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	have seen some really sticky periods in	634.38	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the past as an investor it is very	636.36	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	important to track this number and if it	638.58	5.1
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	comes somewhere close to 12 even 13 then	640.8	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	it's probably good to bail out and	643.68	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	preserve one's capital and yes as a	645.42	5.039
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	general rule hire the car the better it	648.36	5.28
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	is the other risk parameter is the NPA	650.459	4.981
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bit which is also a function of the kind	653.64	4.92
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	of loans a bank has given so NPS stands	655.44	5.579
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	for non-performing assets and represents	658.56	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	those loans both interest and principal	661.019	4.56
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	amount have been in overdue state for a	663.06	4.56
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	very long time in other words these	665.579	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	loans are in the danger of not being	667.62	5.219
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	paid and a loan turns into an MPA if	669.779	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	interest or installments are not	672.839	3.021
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	received for a period of three months	674.399	4.321
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	understandably a high gross NP ratio is	675.86	5.56
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bad as it means the bank's asset quality	678.72	4.799
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	is in a very poor shape in fact the	681.42	4.02
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	entire banking industry in India was in	683.519	4.201
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	a very precarious position just four or	685.44	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	five years back when the gross NP ratio	687.72	5.82
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	was at a worrisome 11.5 percent and it	690.18	4.92
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	took a lot of cleaning up and policy	693.54	3.0
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	changes to bring it down to a more	695.1	3.6
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	manageable five percent when we look at	696.54	4.739
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	it on a per Bank basis we see a lot of	698.7	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	variation on this front one of the banks	701.279	4.261
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	which has managed this very well is HDFC	703.32	5.22
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	with its gross NP hovering between 1 and	705.54	5.22
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	1.5 percent and you can see the other	708.54	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	end end of it with Punjab National Bank	710.76	3.6
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	which is flirting with some real danger	712.74	3.839
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	so these are important numbers to track	714.36	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	because if a bank messes up its lending	716.579	5.281
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	like what happened with pnb in the 2016	718.86	6.18
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	to 2018 period Then not only does it	721.86	5.039
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bring down the profits of that bank but	725.04	3.96
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	cleaning up the balance sheet is a good	726.899	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	two three four year exercise okay so	729.0	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	while a non-performing asset is an	731.339	3.601
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	undesirable thing it is something that	733.2	4.02
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Banks know will certainly happen I mean	734.94	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	even if you were to lend some money to	737.22	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	10 of your closest friends it's very	739.14	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	unlikely that everyone will pay up and	741.42	4.08
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	if you have friends like mine then it's	743.64	4.02
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	likely that none of them will pay up so	745.5	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	what a good bank does is it keeps some	747.66	4.679
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	money aside from its profits in the	750.18	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	anticipation of certain loans going bad	752.339	4.861
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	this money is called a provision and	754.5	5.459
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	that net NPA is simply the gross NPA	757.2	4.98
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	minus these Provisions as a matter of	759.959	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	fact some reports carry a term called	762.18	5.279
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	provisioning coverage ratio or PCR which	764.279	5.041
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	is nothing but the provisions divided by	767.459	4.261
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the gross in peace and if this number is	769.32	4.92
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	high it means the bank is having a	771.72	3.96
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	larger buffer for themselves against	774.24	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	losses in case the NPA start rising in	775.68	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	terms of numbers and again in the case	778.56	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	of htfc the net NPA is generally below	780.12	5.7
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the 0.5 Mark which shows the bank's	782.94	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	proactiveness in not just keeping their	785.82	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	NPS low but in also providing for	787.62	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	potential losses in its loan Book on an	790.26	4.199
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	average Indian banks that is public and	792.36	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	private ones currently operate at a net	794.459	4.801
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	NP of two percent which is a lot lower	796.56	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	than the eight percent number these	799.26	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Banks carried in FY 2018. Point Blank	801.0	6.0
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the lower your gross NPA number the	804.0	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	better will be the bank's profitability	807.0	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	and the lower the net NPA number the	808.68	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	healthier will be the bank's balance	811.68	3.54
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	sheet if you're getting good value from	813.12	4.08

mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	video a thumbs up and if you aren't a	817.2	4.259
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	subscriber yet then do consider becoming	819.3	5.099
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	one as I can then serve you videos as	821.459	4.861
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	soon as they are released and also share	824.399	4.201
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	with you some investing strategies tips	826.32	4.079
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	and stories that are continually posed	828.6	3.9
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	in the community section okay so we	830.399	3.901
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	looked at the raw materials and the risk	832.5	3.42
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	management part of a backing structure	834.3	3.779
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	and now it's important to understand the	835.92	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	product portfolio and consequently where	838.079	4.981
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the bank is making its money from so	840.54	4.56
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	there are four key Revenue segments in	843.06	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	any Bank there is revenue from treasury	845.1	5.4
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	operations there is retail banking	847.8	4.86
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	corporate Banking and of course there is	850.5	3.959
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	revenue from the distribution of	852.66	4.02
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	third-party products now you can read up	854.459	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	a lot about these four segments and A	856.68	3.719
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bank's annual report is the perfect	858.959	4.261
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	source for it but as a general principle	860.399	5.341
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	if the core of A bank's revenue is	863.22	4.619
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	coming from retail and corporate then	865.74	3.96
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	it's generally a good sign to take it up	867.839	3.961
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	a step further if the retail part is	869.7	4.02
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	higher than corporate then it's even	871.8	3.24
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	better and I think we've already	873.72	3.239
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	established the retail versus Corporate	875.04	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	part earlier in the video in fact Banks	876.959	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	make a lot of Revenue in the form of	879.48	3.78
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	fees and therefore fee income is	881.279	3.601
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	something that investors should	883.26	3.36
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	definitely keep a track on on a bank on	884.88	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Bank basis for instance Banks like ICICI	886.62	5.94
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	hdf said even access Bank charge a lot	889.62	4.92
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	of fees on just about everything which	892.56	4.019
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	includes foreign exchange loan	894.54	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	processing trading ATM withdrawals Etc	896.579	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	in numbers the proportion of fees in	898.8	4.02
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	case of private Banks is 24 percent	901.199	4.681
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	while it's a much more sedate 16 in the	902.82	5.579
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	case of psus and one can understand why	905.88	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	after all public sector Banks cannot	908.399	3.601
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	charge a lot of fees because of their	910.32	4.019
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	social mandate now what also helps is	912.0	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the diversity in fee based income for	914.339	4.321
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	example icic and HDFC are into	916.74	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	everything which makes it easier for	918.66	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	them to charge fees at many touch points	920.94	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	in fact if we connect it back to what I	923.16	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	said earlier because these two banks	925.44	3.899
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	have a lot of private sector salary	927.66	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	accounts they already have a ready pool	929.339	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	of customers who will need many fee	931.86	3.779
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Based Services and this will keep on	933.779	4.021
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	feeding the revenue engine of these two	935.639	4.681
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	banks for many more years and yes while	937.8	5.279
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	other Banks also provide many services I	940.32	4.8
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	don't think they are as diverse as what	943.079	3.901
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	these two banks have except maybe the	945.12	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	State Bank of India so as investors it's	946.98	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	always a very worthy access size to	949.5	3.839
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	understand how this Revenue pie is	951.42	3.96
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	increasing and in which direction it is	953.339	3.781
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	increasing which will give you a clear	955.38	4.199
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	assessment of the bank's Focus its	957.12	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	strategies and most importantly where	959.579	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the growth is coming from the next	961.62	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	metric an investor needs to examine is	963.959	4.081
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the cost to income ratio which is simply	965.94	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the operating expenses divided by the	968.04	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	operating income in other words it's the	970.32	3.959
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	cost of running a bank and it includes	972.42	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	employee salaries Branch costs cost of	974.279	4.86
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Technology printing of an ATM card Etc	976.86	5.279
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	so the cost income ratio is a basic one	979.139	4.741
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	that is used to assess the profitability	982.139	4.14
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	of a bank and of course the lower this	983.88	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	ratio is the better it is now the	986.279	4.261
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	general trend for the banking industry	988.5	4.199
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	has been a cost to income ratio of	990.54	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	around 50 percent with the psus being	992.699	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	over the 50 Mark while the private banks	995.04	4.14
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	have been below it but some of the best	997.019	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	run private banks are a lot lower with	999.18	5.219
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	HDFC Bank showing the way in fact as a	1001.759	5.58
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	thumb rule if a bank is between 35 and	1004.399	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	45 then it means they are being	1007.339	4.321
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	efficiently run and as is always the	1009.139	5.101
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	case with any efficiency indicator it	1011.66	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	should be looked at as a trend rather	1014.24	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	than a one-off number as we see how htfc	1015.92	4.68
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	bank has brought it down over the past	1018.56	3.0
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	few years	1020.6	3.719
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	what this declining cost income ratio	1021.56	4.739
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	also shows is that these Banks can bring	1024.319	4.98
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	in incremental Revenue at a low cost and	1026.299	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the more that happens the better it is	1029.299	3.78
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	for the profitability of that bank	1030.919	4.201
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the next three metrics relate to the	1033.079	4.081
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	valuation of a bank in comparison to its	1035.12	4.5
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	peers and the first of these is the	1037.16	5.639
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	return on asset metric so the Roa shows	1039.62	5.699
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	how efficiently a bank is utilizing its	1042.799	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Assets in terms of generating revenue	1045.319	3.961
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	from it which means if a bank is leaving	1047.059	4.441
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	its assets idle for a long period of	1049.28	5.04
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	time that is it is taking in deposits	1051.5	5.34
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	but it's not able to lend money then it	1054.32	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	not only brings down the Roa and	1056.84	4.079
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	therefore the profits but it can also	1058.7	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	lead to a severe asset liability	1060.919	3.481
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	mismatch which can have severe	1062.9	3.899
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	consequences now the Roe is not a number	1064.4	5.1
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	one should look at in isolation in fact	1066.799	4.561
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the points we discussed earlier that is	1069.5	4.14
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the net interest margin the sources of	1071.36	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	fund that is the deposits the asset	1073.64	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	quality that is the gross NPA or the	1075.98	3.9
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	lack of it are all important	1077.9	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	determinants in understanding the Roa or	1079.88	4.799
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	might I say the potential future Roi of	1082.16	5.34
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	a bank so if the Nim is increasing every	1084.679	6.24
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	quarter if npas are going down then this	1087.5	5.52
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	has a powerful positive impact on the r	1090.919	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	way which then allows for a re-rating	1093.02	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	for that banking stock an investor can	1095.299	3.661
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	make a lot of money out of it	1097.76	3.659
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	additionally and as is the case with	1098.96	4.98
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	most metrics it's preferable to see the	1101.419	4.981
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Roe as a trend that is look at this	1103.94	4.14
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	number over a few years to get a better	1106.4	4.08
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	idea on where it is headed for instance	1108.08	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Banks like kotak Mahindra and HDFC have	1110.48	4.8
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	maintained their Roa a lot better and	1112.82	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	very consistently as compared to an	1115.28	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	ICICI and access bank in fact icsa bank	1117.08	4.86
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	is a good case study here which has seen	1119.9	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	erratic Roa numbers and that's because	1121.94	4.859
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	this bank has lost its focus not once	1124.34	5.699
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	but twice in the last 16 17 years so as	1126.799	5.581
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	a thumb rule the best bands have an Roa	1130.039	5.101
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	of over 1.5 percent which is one place	1132.38	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	most public sector Banks don't fit in	1135.14	3.659
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	with many of them falling below the one	1137.12	3.96
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	percent Mark come to think of it even	1138.799	4.141
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	one percent is actually not bad because	1141.08	3.9
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the last decade has been very poor for	1142.94	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	PSU Banks but this doesn't mean	1144.98	5.46
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	investing in a PSU is bad I would say it	1147.32	5.219
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	is more to do with timing so if you keep	1150.44	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	a track of the numbers and act when you	1152.539	4.14
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	see an uplift then the odds of making	1154.7	4.62
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	money even from PSU Banks can see a	1156.679	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	massive Improvement okay the next	1159.32	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	commonly used valuation metric is The	1161.419	4.321
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	Price to Book value ratio now this	1163.58	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	metric can't be a surprise to any of us	1165.74	4.319
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	after all the bank business is all about	1167.78	4.8
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	managing their investment and Loan book	1170.059	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	efficiently and somewhere both these	1172.58	4.2
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	metrics that is The Price to Book value	1174.799	4.861
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	and the Roa are interconnected for	1176.78	5.759
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	example a bank like kotak trades at a	1179.66	5.16
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	price to book of over four almost five	1182.539	5.221
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	because it also has an Roa of over two	1184.82	5.219
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	the same goes for HDFC bank and also	1187.76	5.22
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	icsa Bank to some extent but not as much	1190.039	4.801
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	for other private Banks and definitely	1192.98	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	not for public sector Banks now just	1194.84	4.74
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	like the Roa or any valuation metric	1197.24	4.26
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	investors should examine the price to	1199.58	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	book ratio as a trend across years and	1201.5	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	across Banks to get a better idea of	1204.02	3.779
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	where it is heading so essentially if	1205.82	3.96
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	one sees the inherent characteristics of	1207.799	4.561
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	a bank improving but if the price to	1209.78	4.92
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	book ratio is still lagging then that	1212.36	4.38
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	presents us with a valuation Gap that	1214.7	3.78
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	can be looked at and our final	1216.74	3.6
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	examination area when looking at Banks	1218.48	4.02
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	is the value of its subsidiaries now	1220.34	4.44
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	most banks create subsidiaries and they	1222.5	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	generally have an asset management	1224.78	4.8
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	company that is a mutual fund company a	1226.82	4.739
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	life insurance company a general	1229.58	4.86
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	insurance company a broking business a	1231.559	5.101
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	financing company for only vehicle loans	1234.44	4.16
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	or lending to subprime customers Etc	1236.66	4.32
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	these are generally joint ventures with	1238.6	4.78
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	domestic or International companies and	1240.98	4.319
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	although they might have started small	1243.38	5.22
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	in 10 20 years of operations these	1245.299	4.681
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	subsidiaries would have become a lot	1248.6	3.72
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	valuable in the overall scheme of things	1249.98	5.16
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	for example the State Bank of India has	1252.32	4.979
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	a number of subsidiaries some listed and	1255.14	4.98
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	some unlisted among the listed ones it	1257.299	5.221
mdS4n0R3s0U	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS4n0R3s0U	has its credit card business and also it	1260.12	5.1

DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the stage and we can see the transition happening  as well. But I think for me, one interesting	128.04	7.32
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	observation from the meeting was there was a  question about United States and its dominance and	135.36	7.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	dollar as it is of currency. Munger, I know is  usually bit skeptical or pessimistic about it,	142.92	7.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and Buffett is usually the cheerleader who would  immediately rebuttal or disagree with Munger	150.66	8.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and then talk about American exceptionalism.	159.72	3.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:03:00] Hari Ramachandra:  This time he was somewhere,	163.44	2.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	he didn’t really go for the  cheerleading. He was thoughtful. He said	170.16	6.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	there are a lot of things going for United  States, but tribalism has to cover so,	177.36	5.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and he is not so sure. I think for me,  that was the key takeaway from the meeting.	183.06	6.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:03:19] Stig Brodersen: How about you, Tobi?	189.42	2.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:03:21] Tobias Carlisle: I think it’s amazing  that they can sit there for three hours at a time	191.58	4.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	eating peanut brittle and drinking coke and just  field questions. They’re very diverse questions.	197.76	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Sometimes it’s about specific to the Berkshire  Hathaway and sometimes they’re sort of more	203.1	4.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	philosophical and Buffett’s ability to sort of  say something succinctly is amazing. Last year	207.36	9.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	they only got through five questions  before lunch, something like that.	217.5	3.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	And this year I thought the answers,  Buffett rambled a little bit last year	221.76	5.4
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and he’d get off topic a little bit on some of  the questions and I thought it was a little bit,	227.16	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it’s tough to be that kind of in your  nineties and be coherent and cogent.	233.64	6.152
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:03:54] Tobias Carlisle: There aren’t  many around who are in that sort of	239.792	2.188
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	with that intellect that sustains into that age.  But this year I thought he was back better than	243.72	6.42
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	ever. You got to hear how fast he’s spoke in the  sixties and seventies. He now speaks at sort of	250.14	7.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	at a normal pace now, but in the sixties and  seventies he’s spoke exceptionally fast pace.	258.42	3.992
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:04:12] Tobias Carlisle: So maybe he’s  just come back to the crowd a little bit.	262.412	2.368
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Munger, amazing that he’s a hundred in  February if he makes it but it’s an amazing	265.38	6.42
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	run and he’s brilliant as well. Yeah, I  really enjoyed it. I just sort of soak up	272.88	7.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the philosophy that they have. I think is  more about trying to survive. First of all,	283.26	6.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	trying to do the right thing. Second of all and  I find both of those things really attractive	289.5	4.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	as businessmen and as investors and then  everything else is sort of secondary to that. But	295.44	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	those two things really stand out to me and I just  like going in there and soaking that up once a	300.18	5.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	year. I’ll be sad when it doesn’t happen anymore,  but it was a great time. Great seeing everybody.	305.22	3.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:04:47] Stig Brodersen: Yeah and it was  absolutely wonderful and I agree with you Tobi,	309.0	5.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	last year was like, he had, I don’t know, three  to five things he really wanted to say and	314.88	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it didn’t really matter what kind of  question he would get because we would	320.22	4.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	just like go on and like say whatever  he wanted to say about a specific topic.	324.36	4.32
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:05:02] Stig Brodersen: This time he was very  much like, no, we have, I want to say he was 60,	328.68	4.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	he mentioned, and he said 26, now we are,  and we still have like 34 to go or whatever,	332.82	4.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	just before lunch. And like, so he was, he very  much to the point, there was some really great	337.44	4.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	questions about like, not just about the  successions and all that you always have,	341.7	5.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but like how to motivate people who are financial,  independent, running those subsidiaries.	347.28	3.573
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:05:21] Stig Brodersen: I  really like that question and	350.853	1.407
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I really like the way that  they responded to that. So	352.26	3.54
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	yeah. And then I had a chance to hang out  with you guys. That was that was pretty cool.	356.46	5.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:05:30] Tobias Carlisle: Yeah.  I was sad I didn’t cross paths	361.5	2.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	with Hari but I sort of have  to run from event to event.	364.26	3.979
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:05:35] Hari Ramachandra: Yeah, I guess  we missed each other by an hour or so.	368.239	3.281
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:05:38] Hari Ramachandra: Tobi, I think  there was one TIP get together I was part of,	371.52	4.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I was told you’ll arrive and Stig  hadn’t arrived but then Stig came later.	376.38	3.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	But then I had to go, my son was  really hungry, so we have to run.	380.88	3.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:05:52] Stig Brodersen: Fair enough.  Alright, so we have not been drawing straws	386.36	7.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	who are going to kick this off, but  Hari, you… cause you have to go here	395.82	3.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a bit later in our conversation,  so why don’t you take it from here.	399.42	5.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:06:04] Hari Ramachandra: Awesome, so good to  be back in the mastermind pitching ideas again. So	404.58	6.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	my pick today is Palantir and  I’ve been thinking about this	411.84	7.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	company and Tobi and Stig I know  we spoke about it offline as well.	419.1	4.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:06:17] Hari Ramachandra: I’m still forming  my conviction around this idea, so that’s why I	423.36	6.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	was kind of hesitant to pitch it here but I felt  it was timely to get your thoughts on. For those	429.6	7.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	who are not aware, Palantir is in the broad area  of data analytics, but it’s really hard to bucket	437.4	6.54
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	them into any one category but data analytics  kind of, but they’re into security as well.	443.94	7.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:06:39] Hari Ramachandra: Their  claim to fame was their willingness	451.08	3.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to work with the government agencies and  especially after 9/11, the work they did	454.26	5.4
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	caught everybody’s attention. So that’s and then  also the eclectic CEO, Alex Karp who moved the	460.5	9.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	company from Silicon Valley, San Francisco to  Denver squandered by Peter Theil back in 2003.	469.5	8.611
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:07:02] Hari Ramachandra: So it’s been  around for a while. They took a while to really	478.111	3.989
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	identify their markets and as we stand  today, the majority of the revenue comes	483.42	8.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	from government agencies, especially working  with security agencies. They’re now famous	491.64	5.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	for helping Ukraine in the war with Russia  with the intelligence in their software.	496.86	7.591
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:07:22] Hari Ramachandra: Ukraine has actually  been able to do very well is what Alex Karp claims	504.451	6.089
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	what their core technology is about bringing  data in desperate places within an organization,	511.98	11.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	whether it’s started with government, with  different departments, harmonizing them,	523.26	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	having that data available to provide  insights and intelligence and recognizance,	530.04	7.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and it’s a very complex problem.	539.28	1.891
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:07:49] Hari Ramachandra: There are many  companies in this area that are trying to	541.171	2.909
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	solve this problem, and it’s a real  problem for government, obviously,	546.54	4.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	like, especially when we have FBI, CIA and  other government agencies or local police	551.52	6.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	departments not talking to each other. In fact,  there is a YouTube video on how 9/11 happened	558.24	10.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and many months before, there were some  agencies who knew something will happen	569.4	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but they were not able to connect the dots  and that’s what volunteer claims to do.	574.74	5.491
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:08:20] Hari Ramachandra: They’ve  helped agencies connect the dots.	580.231	2.789
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	In fact, this problem also surfaced in  the work shared annual meeting when Ajit	583.98	6.84
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	was asked about Geico and how Geico  is doing, and he talked about one of	590.82	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the major challenges Geico is facing is  that there are so many software’s and so	596.64	4.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	many sources of data. I forget the number,  whatever it was in the thirties or forties.	601.56	4.23
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:08:44] Tobias Carlisle: Six hundred systems	605.79	0.742
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:08:47] Hari Ramachandra: Thank you Tobi.	606.532	5.708
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	It’s really hard for them to kind of connect all  this together and I was thinking if somebody from	615.0	5.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Palantir had attended this meeting or at least  watched this, they will be making a call to	620.58	5.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Geico. Palantir probably will be really a good  fit. So they have two platform. One is Gotham,	626.04	6.3
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	which is mainly focused on security  agencies and government customers.	632.34	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:09:10] Hari Ramachandra: And another one that  they recently, that is three or four years back	637.68	4.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	came up with is Foundry but they’re all powered by  another platform called Apollo, which is basically	642.6	10.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	not just software delivery of data or harmonizing  of data, but also delivery of the software.	653.46	7.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	They’re cloud native, so they have really  amazing partnerships with Microsoft and AWS.	661.32	5.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:09:33] Hari Ramachandra: They have  been growing their revenue at the rate	666.48	3.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of 40%. This year, it dipped a bit low but  their revenue growth is in the range of 40%,	670.44	4.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	close to 50% back in 2020. Today, their revenue  is close to 2 billion. Their market cap is 22	676.26	8.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	billion. It’s definitely not cheap by any  standard. They were losing a lot of money,	685.14	8.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but they’ve been able to  kind of get close to break.	693.9	3.884
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:09:57] Hari Ramachandra: So their  earnings per share is negative 26	697.784	4.576
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and the market in which they’re playing.  So far, 55% of their revenue comes from	704.34	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	government agency is only 45% from commercial.  But there is a huge potential for what they	710.58	7.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	do. Like I believe it is the VP who took  out Chevron. I need to, one of the oil	717.66	8.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	majors actually took a 1% stake in this company  after they saw what volunteer can do for them.	726.42	8.071
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:10:25] Hari Ramachandra: And I am, I’m  forgetting which one. It was VP of Chevron,	734.491	3.089
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	one of them, because that was the impact.  And when companies use their software,	737.58	8.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	they see the difference and. Alex Cox in many  of his interviews, he’s always saying that we	746.64	6.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	are not slideware like many companies, they  just have power points, but not software.	752.88	5.131
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:10:44] Hari Ramachandra: But he says like,  try us. And that’s where their strength comes	758.011	4.949
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	from. Their market in which they operate as  data analytics, which is 41 billion today in	762.96	5.94
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	terms of total address for market, it is  expected to grow to 346 billion by 2030.	768.9	5.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So they’re kind of set up in  the right place. They have the	778.74	3.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	right technologies with 4,000 plus employees,  they’re the right size, they’re very efficient.	781.86	2.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:11:08] Hari Ramachandra: Having said that,  everything is not rosy. I think for them it’s	784.74	7.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a go-to market. Their per unit cost is really  expensive in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.	792.18	6.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So usually they play in the big enterprises, but  their sales force is not the typical sales team.	798.66	9.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	They have a very small percentage of their  employee base sales team, only 15% I believe.	808.38	4.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:11:31] Hari Ramachandra:  They’re struggling to kind of,	814.02	3.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	making roads in scale. So that’s where it’s more  like a venture but is they can solve their sales	819.36	7.02
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and channel problem. And build an ecosystem they  can really grow from here. So that’s the bit here,	826.38	8.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	because their product is, they have a killer app  or a killer product, which is one of the best.	835.14	6.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:11:51] Hari Ramachandra: But they need  to figure out the guru market strategy. They	841.26	4.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	have been growing, but I can, if you look at  something a company like Snowflake, which is	845.64	5.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	growing a hundred percent year over year for past  three years with around 22 billion market caps,	850.92	6.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it is valued at 55 billion today and  then EPS is negative $2.50 cents.	857.64	7.411
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:12:10] Hari Ramachandra: So they’re  losing a lot of money but they’re able to	865.051	3.809
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	figure out the go market strategy and one of  the criticism of Palantir is that it doesn’t	868.86	6.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	have a starter package or a modular breakdown  of their product so that somebody can just	875.82	8.7
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	onboard with a slower cost and then kind of,  gradually expand where Snowflake offers that.	885.6	8.191
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:12:33] Hari Ramachandra: And also there is  no easy on ramp to them in the sense you go to	893.791	2.969
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Snowflake, you can. Sign up for a free trial on  Ram to the product, do a trial use. That part	896.76	7.32
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Palantir is not so smooth. So those are some of  the challenges. So it’s not like it’s a sure shot	904.08	9.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but if they can figure that out, then  there is huge potential for this company.	915.12	6.451
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:12:57] Hari Ramachandra: So it’s  more kind of a venture, but so Tobi,	921.571	3.389
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	this is definitely not value. So there is a lot  of ifs and buts there. But as a technologist,	924.96	10.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	when I look at their products, I have looked into  a lot of their demos, have seen their CTO and the	936.12	7.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	CEO who really deeply understands the problem  set, they understand what ontology very well.	944.1	7.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:13:22] Hari Ramachandra: They’ve launched an  AI platform recently and they have been doing AI	952.08	6.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	all the while. All the while because it’s all  about anomaly detection, signals and synthesis	958.8	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and prediction. So they’re  really prepared well for the	965.34	5.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	next era in that sense. And they’re  prepared to empower many enterprises.	970.98	6.151
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:13:43] Hari Ramachandra: So that’s  the bet here but I wouldn’t give it	977.131	5.009
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a hundred percent probability that it’ll  work out the way I’m projecting it. Well,	982.14	4.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	if they can figure out their go-to market, if  they can figure out and build a good ecosystem	986.94	6.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and a good on ram to their products, they  have a huge potential and this might be a very	994.68	6.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	undervalued company if that happens. That’s  my pitch and looking forward to your feedback.	1002.3	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:14:10] Tobias Carlisle: As Hari was  delivering that, I was thinking, I’m so	1010.1	3.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	glad we have Hari on this podcast because this is  just not something that is understandable for me.	1013.7	6.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	The way that I invest is mostly  through the financial statements,	1020.54	4.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	trying to model the ability of a  business to earn in the future.	1028.28	3.872
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:14:27] Tobias Carlisle: And with something  like Palantir, it’s just, I don’t have enough	1032.152	3.508
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	domain expertise to be able to do that,  and I can’t read the financial statements,	1036.8	6.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	see where the business can get to. I tend to like  more mature businesses that are at the point where	1044.96	5.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	they’re returning capital to shareholders,  where they’ve got material free cash flow	1050.42	6.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that they’re returning and they’re still able to  grow with what they’ve established for Palantir.	1057.8	6.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:14:52] Tobias Carlisle: It’s just  not enough has happened for me to	1063.86	7.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	make those assessments. So it’s just  something that’s, it’s just too hard	1070.94	4.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	for me. But I was impressed listening to Hari,  it sounds attractive and when they figure out	1075.74	7.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that go-to-market strategy and I can get a better  idea about how they are. There are many things	1083.3	4.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that are very attractive about it but I’ll have  to defer to Hari on this one. I’m going to pass.	1088.22	8.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:15:14] Stig Brodersen: I just saw that Cathie  Wood of Ark Fund just brought it back today. So	1098.78	34.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I don’t know if that’s a bull sign or a bear sign.	1134.66	2.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I’ll let the listeners decide how they  feel about it. One thing that I’m not	1138.38	8.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a not a big fan of is just the way that  she has outstanding, it’s just ballooned.	1146.48	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:15:31] Stig Brodersen: It’s almost parabolic.  And I know like all the seven past quarters it’s	1151.22	5.52
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	gone down the pace. It’s been even more than  I, I looked up more than a hundred percent	1156.74	7.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of revenue. It’s like, is that possible?	1166.22	2.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:15:43] Tobias Carlisle: Is that as part of  the listing or is it subsequent to the listing?	1168.38	4.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:15:47] Stig Brodersen: No, this was in 2021	1172.88	5.52
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and today it’s around 26 ish, and I’m  not really sure what to do about that.	1180.38	9.42
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:15:54] Stig Brodersen: If you look at  the revenue number, it looks great. Like,	1189.8	3.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	like Hari said it’s, it looks nice, but then you  go revenue per year and it looks…that’s nice.	1193.58	6.84
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Who knows? I have the chance to read a few  stocks analysis before I jumped on this call.	1203.06	8.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	There were quite a few that seemed pretty bullish,  but I, it, oh man I hate to come out here.	1218.84	6.333
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:16:13] Stig Brodersen: It was just like, it  was in my two hard piles. I have a really hard	1225.173	2.787
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	time wrap my head around a company operating like  this and how they’re going to change the future.	1227.96	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I don’t doubt that they’re as good as Hari is  saying, but for me, doing the valuation piece,	1234.92	4.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it’s just really tricky for this company, in  that framework of doing the destination analysis,	1240.86	18.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I have an idea of, the pick I’m going to talk  about here today, but it could be any other	1259.52	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	pick where I was like, this is sort of like  how I think it would look like in 10 years	1264.86	4.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	with all the mistakes that I can possibly  make and biases of not of, just be wrong.	1269.42	5.793
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:16:46] Stig Brodersen: I have a really hard  time figuring out where Palantir is in 10 years	1275.213	3.807
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	essentially. It stems from, I have a really  hard time figuring out where they are today.	1280.28	3.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So it’s just above my pay grade.	1284.54	2.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:16:57] Tobias Carlisle: Hari, can  I just ask you a few questions? You	1287.96	11.52
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	describe it as a killer app. Can you just for the  non-technologist like me, why is it a killer app?	1299.48	9.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:17:05] Hari Ramachandra: I  think that’s a good point and Stig,	1308.72	4.32
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I’ll also come back to your point, but thank  you. This is really helpful feedback. So	1313.04	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	when we say a killer app, what I mean by the  Tobi is think of like ChatGPT as a killer because	1319.7	9.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	what it did was it caught the imagination of  the public and also it is solving a use case.	1330.02	6.271
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:17:26] Hari Ramachandra: It really honing on  a use case that is really impactful for the users.	1336.291	7.289
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Or it’s basically either scratching an itch or  really solving a pain point for many companies. So	1345.02	7.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	in an enterprise world, a killer app is something  that is where the customers will chase you	1352.52	5.7
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to buy your product. Like what Aji was  describing in the Geico is like that	1359.42	7.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	basically there is no capability within  that organization to solve that problem.	1366.5	5.191
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:17:56] Hari Ramachandra: It’s not a,  it’s not an easy problem, otherwise they	1371.691	2.369
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	would’ve solved it. And what Palantir has done  is, has figured out how to solve this problem	1374.06	6.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	because they solved a more complex problem with  government agencies, especially counterterrorism	1382.1	8.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	security and all that stuff. So dark expertise.  Now they’re applying to commercial and enterprise.	1390.14	9.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:18:22] Tobias Carlisle: So the  problem is that you have all of these	1399.32	3.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	different systems that don’t talk to each other,  and they’re producing data that’s humans have to	1403.64	8.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	sort of put together across these systems. And  so what Palantir does is they create some sort	1412.52	6.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of AI or some ability to read this data and  put it all together into one user interface.	1419.18	7.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:18:44] Tobias Carlisle: So that you can then  automate the sort of monitoring and analysis of	1427.1	7.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	these data feeds, and then you’re able to make  some sort of analysis that rolls up into something	1434.24	8.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that’s understandable by a human, and you can  see where there’s some deterioration or some,	1442.88	4.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	something is going on so that you can then monitor  that system more closely is that description?	1447.56	6.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:19:09] Hari Ramachandra: Yeah, that’s  a very good summary of what they do	1454.28	5.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but then there are certain problems with doing  that. So bringing all the data together is one	1459.56	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	part but making sure it is secure. And also making  sure that, how do you apply security predicates so	1464.9	9.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that not everybody can access everything, but they  have only certain view of the data, for example.	1474.8	5.971
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:19:34] Hari Ramachandra: That’s  a very complex problem. It sounds	1480.771	2.609
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	as, so it’s like just not a feature, but it’s  core to that product because. The reason we	1484.34	7.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	don’t bring all the data into one place is  because of security. So having that security	1491.96	7.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	architecture in place, having the right security  posture for the product is critical as well.	1499.58	7.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:19:56] Hari Ramachandra: And Palantir  seems to have solved both of these problems.	1506.66	3.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Actually, that part is well figured out. Like  once you have data harmonized and secure,	1516.74	4.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	you can apply ml or you can  use visualizations, you can use	1521.0	5.7
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	anomaly detections, or you can also use  predictions. So those part is figured out.	1528.08	6.3
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:20:14] Tobias Carlisle: Thank you.	1534.38	2.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:20:15] Stig Brodersen: Alright,	1540.68	0.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I think that was what we had for Palantir.  I am going to throw it over to Tobi.	1543.98	6.54
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:20:22] Tobias Carlisle: Thanks,  Stig. My pick today is Virtu Financial.	1550.52	8.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Virtu is a high frequency trading shop that does  market making and execution across an enormous	1560.42	10.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	number of financial markets. Anything from ETFs.  So they provide the backend infrastructure for	1570.5	7.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	many ETFs, not mine, but they are one  of the parties that I could have used.	1579.26	5.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:20:45] Tobias Carlisle: They  essentially make a market in between,	1584.84	6.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it could be Forex Foreign Exchange, it could  be equities, it could be futures, options.	1591.8	4.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	They’re trying to buy and sell at the same time,  standing in between two parties and to take a	1597.56	7.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	penny or so every single time. So they rely on  having the best technology, good connections.	1605.0	9.692
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:21:08] Tobias Carlisle: They are the  second biggest market maker for retail.	1614.692	4.648
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	They are 25% of the market. Citadel is bigger.  Citadel I think is about 40% of the market.	1619.34	7.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	The business does well when there’s  more volatility in the market and	1629.3	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	there’s more trading. So they did very well  through the whole meme stock explosion.	1635.12	7.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:21:29] Tobias Carlisle: And there have  been a few sorts of developments there	1642.5	4.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that the retail public has largely moved  away from that speculative mania. And so	1646.64	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	their financials are going to have to  normalize beyond that. And so that’s been,	1652.88	4.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I think that’s one of the main reasons that  the stock has traded as low as it is because	1656.96	4.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the last few years don’t look great on a revenue  basis just because they’ve come down like that.	1662.84	5.372
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:21:51] Tobias Carlisle: But there  have been some other developments that	1668.212	2.728
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	are sort of interesting so that, there’s  been this explosion in these zero day to	1670.94	4.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	expiry options. So people to speculate, inspire  options in options that expire today or tomorrow.	1675.56	9.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So zero days to expiry options mostly inspire, so  people come into spy and trade in these things.	1685.28	6.512
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:22:13] Tobias Carlisle: And  there was some question initially	1691.792	2.008
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	whether they would be beneficiary of that  or whether that would hurt their business.	1693.8	3.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	It seems that it’s mutual to slightly beneficial  but there is also this other concern that	1698.72	8.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	if you, this is a slightly complex idea, but the  abstract version of it is basically this, that	1708.02	9.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	sophisticated market participants can use  options to move the underlying equity.	1717.86	6.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:22:38] Tobias Carlisle: And  so it’s called gamma hedging,	1724.22	5.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	gamma manipulation. But basically what they’re  trying to do is they can move the underlying	1729.38	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	by piling into the options, and then the market  maker has to hedge their exposure by buying it.	1735.68	7.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So if I wanted to push the stock price up in  something, I’d go and buy a whole lot of calls,	1742.76	3.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	which would then make the market,  make it a hedge, a call, which is the	1746.72	4.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	ripe but not the obligation to transact  at a higher price in the future.	1750.86	5.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:23:05] Tobias Carlisle: To hedge that  position. It’s necessary for the market,	1756.22	4.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	make it to buy the underlying, so they buy  the equity, which incrementally pushes up the	1761.18	5.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	price. And so there was some, there’s been  some sort of conspiracy theory that there’s	1766.64	6.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	some gamma manipulation in Tesla stock,  for example, that there’s a lot of option	1774.68	5.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	activity and that to hedge it, you then buy the  underlying and it pushes up the stock price.	1780.32	5.852
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:23:29] Tobias Carlisle: So are they hurt by  that? Are they able to trade their way around?	1786.172	5.188
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	That seems that in the zero days to expiry options  they seem to be okay neutral to maybe slightly	1791.36	7.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	beneficial because more trading is good for them.  They’re trying to be market makers on the other	1799.34	3.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	side. The business though, has suffered because of  this sort of the disappearance of the meme stock.	1802.94	7.052
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:23:49] Tobias Carlisle: And it  attracted a lot of attention from the SEC	1809.992	2.548
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	in that payment for order flow where Robinhood,  for example, They could give you a free trade	1814.88	8.94
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	because they sold the trade information to one  of the market makers who then front ran the	1823.82	4.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	trade, and they made that penny in front of the  Robinhood trader who was trying to make their own.	1828.8	9.692
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:24:10] Tobias Carlisle: And they  were very wide bit ask spread. So	1838.492	2.188
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	they were making a lot of money and  that’s why Robinhood was able to be,	1840.68	2.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that’s how Robinhood generated its income.  They were paid by these market makers.	1843.14	3.54
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	The SEC doesn’t seem to like that. And so there’s  this ongoing reform process. I think that some	1847.58	9.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of the changes are to the market structure  are going to be good for the market makers.	1856.94	5.492
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:24:30] Tobias Carlisle: Some of  them are going to be bad for the market	1862.432	1.828
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	makers. They’re pushing back against the bad  ones. They’re trying to adopt the good ones.	1864.26	3.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	They’ve also received a wealth notice,  which is that the SEC will take some	1867.92	4.32
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	enforcement action against them. And we don’t  know what that is yet, but they’re going to be,	1872.24	3.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it gives them an opportunity to respond and  negotiate because these are quite complex.	1876.5	3.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:24:47] Tobias Carlisle: Businesses. And  so the SEC is not necessarily as familiar with	1880.28	9.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the underlying nature of the business as the  business themselves. So they give them these	1889.34	3.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	notices and they then negotiate. All of that  has sort of pushed the price of this stock down	1893.0	8.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to, it was $18, last time I looked,  it was closed at 18 last night.	1901.94	4.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:25:08] Tobias Carlisle: In addition  to that, they have this reasonably complex	1906.32	5.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	capital structure where they’ve got various  different classes of shares. The insiders	1914.0	5.4
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	hold these shares that have 10 times the votes  of others. So the insiders are in control of	1919.4	6.3
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	this company. And so you have to kind of trust the  insiders here that they know what they’re doing.	1925.7	3.992
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:25:24] Tobias Carlisle: They  also, they get quite a lot of	1929.692	2.788
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	their options and all of these things  being paid out to these guys all the time.	1934.94	4.02
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So I’m not describing something that sounds  particularly attractive. I appreciate that and	1940.16	3.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I think that if I’m being completely honest about  this doc, I think it’s…my main attraction to this,	1943.94	7.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I think that this is more of a trade  than an investment that you hold forever.	1951.02	3.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:25:46] Tobias Carlisle: But I’ll explain  to you why I’m attracted to it from a trading	1954.92	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	perspective. And when I say trade, I mean you’re  looking at to an event and beyond that event,	1959.12	6.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it’s less interesting. And so the reason  that I like this stock here is that it is,	1966.08	5.52
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it’s trading close to its lows over the last  few years that basically free cash flow,	1971.6	7.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	generative as interest rates go up, that’s  likely the cost of funding will go up.	1978.98	4.052
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:26:11] Tobias Carlisle: And that’s  been an advantage for them. Their cost	1983.032	2.068
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of fundings been virtually zero, but they  do have some debt interest rates will go up	1985.1	3.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	because they’re trying to, they’re trying to trade  on margin for the most part on both sides of the	1989.3	5.4
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	or they’re trying to trade on, they’ve got some  debt in the business cause they can do that.	1995.3	3.84
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:26:27] Tobias Carlisle: Their cost of  funding will go up. So that’s another reason	2000.46	2.7
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	why it’s probably depressed, but. The event  is that if we get some market correction,	2003.16	5.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	if we get a lot of volatility returning to the  market, they will be massive beneficiaries of	2008.38	4.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that volatility and they could have an explosive  period where the rest of the market is going down.	2013.96	5.4
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:26:45] Tobias Carlisle: And so the thing that  I like about it is that it’s basically a market	2019.36	4.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	hedge in the event that you get a very substantial  crash, which I think there’s a reasonable chance	2024.16	9.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that we see something like that in 2023 or early  2024, very early 2024. So my attraction to it is,	2033.4	9.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I think it’s undervalued.  It’s quite free cash flow.	2043.36	3.392
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:27:06] Tobias Carlisle: Generative, they’ve  been using that free cash letter buyback stock,	2046.752	3.808
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I think in my notes to sort of the lesser  voting shares that the public holds. There	2051.52	14.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	are about 122 million of them in 2020. At year  end. There were 95 million of them in the last	2065.68	6.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	queue. So they’ve bought back, I don’t know what  that works out to, but 20% say of their stock.	2072.64	6.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:27:29] Tobias Carlisle: Over that period of  time as they’ve come down. So I think they think	2078.88	4.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that they’re undervalued at that level. They also  pay a very substantial dividend. So the dividend	2083.38	5.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	is now, the yield on the dividend is over 5% at  $18 where it’s currently trading. So the trade	2088.66	8.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	looks to me like a positive carry into a potential  correction where they would do very well.	2096.88	7.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:27:50] Tobias Carlisle: And it would be one  of those things that should perform if we get	2104.32	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a crash. And so that’s, it’s a dirty shirt and  there’s things that I don’t like about it, but	2110.32	7.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that quality, that it has positive cash  flow, positive carry into a correction is	2118.24	6.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the reason that I’m attracted to it. I hold  it in Zig and it’s one of the 30 positions.	2124.96	5.252
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:28:11] Tobias Carlisle: And you, as  I’m trying to build a portfolio that will	2130.212	7.168
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	perform there rather than focus too much on  any individual stock. And I can rebalance	2137.38	4.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	out of any of these positions at any given  time. And I’ve got to rebalance that coming	2142.24	3.42
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	up in a month. And I don’t know between  now and then what the circle clicks at.	2145.66	4.069
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:28:27] Tobias Carlisle: If you  return to my portfolio, if you hear	2149.729	4.091
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	this and it’s past a month and you return to  the portfolio and you see it’s not in there,	2153.82	3.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and I’m explaining this, you know why that  could have happened. I don’t know what happens.	2157.0	3.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I have an idea what my model looks like all  the time, and it’s well inside my model and	2161.68	3.54
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it’s undervalued and it’s got that sort of  quality in it, but it’s a, there’s always a	2165.22	5.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	possibility that I rebalance out and I just want  to make that plain to everybody from the outset.	2170.8	3.872
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:28:49] Tobias Carlisle: But in  short, positive, very material dividend,	2174.672	6.928
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	good potential for something to happen in the  event we get some market instability, volatility,	2182.26	4.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	they’re buying back stock in the interim, which  is always I think is a very good sign when a	2188.32	4.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	management will do that, particularly  when they do it in material numbers.	2193.0	2.192
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:29:06] Tobias Carlisle: Like there’s 20% over  a few years is a very good number. And then the	2195.192	5.968
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	downs, the risks and the things that I don’t like  is the, I don’t like the different share classes.	2201.16	4.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	The share classes make it difficult to sort of  determine what the true market capitalization	2205.96	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	with. You’ll see it quoted at 1.7 billion in some  places, which is only counting one set of shares.	2210.4	6.872
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:29:24] Tobias Carlisle: You’ll see at 2.9  billion in other places. They’ve got a little	2217.272	2.848
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	bit of debt in there. The cost of funding will go  up with interest rates going up. And there is this	2220.12	6.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	ongoing negotiation with the SEC that  has culminated in wells notice and	2226.84	4.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	wells notice of enforcement. So that’s  something that you shouldn’t ignore.	2231.18	2.952
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:29:40] Tobias Carlisle: But all of  those things are the reason why I think	2234.132	2.488
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it’s cheap. It’s potentially explosive  in the event that we get some sort of	2236.62	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	big draw down. Happy to take questions, gents.	2241.72	3.42
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:29:49] Hari Ramachandra: Well, thank you Tobi.  This was very educational for me because not just	2273.76	60.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	about the stock, your kind of also explained  how the market works, especially the Tesla	2334.0	5.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	case was very interesting.	2340.66	1.291
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:30:00] Hari Ramachandra: So thank you  for that and what got my attention is it’s	2341.951	7.169
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	more like a mining stock or any other cyclical  stock is what you’re saying. So what you’re,	2349.12	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	what I understand is you’re catching it at a low  point and when things go back, when low point,	2354.94	6.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I mean when things are stable right now in, in  whatever way, when it is calm, the markets are up.	2361.84	5.744
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:30:23] Hari Ramachandra: But  when the volatility picks up,	2367.584	2.236
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	you basically sell out because that’s when they’ll  make a lot of money. The only question I had was,	2369.82	5.94
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	is there any tail risk for this company where  they can go out of business or their business	2375.76	7.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	can be materially impacted or are they  present to kind of survive this cyclical?	2383.38	4.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:30:43] Tobias Carlisle: They are very  good at generating free cash flow. They’ve	2388.24	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	been very good at generating revenues. As  the business shrinks, the business seems	2393.58	3.3
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to scale quite nicely. They can just scale  the business down, scale the business up.	2396.88	4.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So to me that says that they’ve got that  sort of flexibility in the business margins	2403.6	5.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	compress as they go down and the  margins will expand as they go up.	2409.18	3.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:31:03] Tobias Carlisle:  The business was an amazing	2412.24	4.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	looking business when they were going  through in 2019 and 2020 because the,	2416.62	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	there’s just so much trading and it was less  sophisticated trading that jumps across it ask	2422.26	8.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	spread to, for them. That’s great. They make  lots of money and they’re in 25,000 interests.	2430.3	5.552
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:31:22] Tobias Carlisle: There’s always  something that’s, there’s always something	2435.852	2.128
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that’s happening that they can, there’s  always some place for them to make money.	2437.98	4.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	They’ve been kind of cagey about the zero  days to expire options. I suspect that	2443.56	3.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	they can probably make quite a lot of money in  there, but it remains to be seen a little bit.	2447.34	3.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:31:35] Tobias Carlisle: I don’t think that  it has the donut risk. I’m not as confident as I	2450.9	8.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	am said about, lots of the other consumer facing  good companies, but I think that they’re seeing	2459.28	7.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	pretty gnarly conditions at the moment and they’re  still working their way through. I think the big	2466.84	3.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	risks are that. If the s e c does something to  change the nature of that market making business,	2470.8	8.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that’s a black swan that I don’t know  exactly how that plays out, but I think that	2480.82	4.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	they’d be crazy to do something like that cause  it might completely change the structure of the	2486.94	5.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	market that they, I mean, they seem to be  trying to change the structure of the market	2492.7	3.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a little bit, but I’m hoping that it’s mostly,  they seem to say, Virtu seems to say that the	2495.7	7.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	people who will be hurt are the investors and  that they’re going to be fine, whatever happens.	2503.38	4.952
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:32:22] Tobias Carlisle: So  I’m taking that at face value.	2508.332	2.548
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I think that they’re in a good position.  There’s a little bit of debt in there,	2512.92	3.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but they’ve been doing some acquisitions that’s,  it is largely from the acquisitions and I think	2515.98	4.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	probably they’ll bolt something else on when  there’s some more volatility in the market. I	2520.84	6.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	suspect it makes them stronger rather than hurting  them but if volatility completely drains away and	2527.56	8.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the SEC does something, then there’s always the  risk that, yeah, that something happens there.	2535.66	4.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:32:48] Hari Ramachandra: Thank you Tobi.	2539.8	3.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:32:50] Stig Brodersen: I don’t  know if I like the company. I sort	2545.32	6.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of do and I sort of don’t, so wow.  That’s a terrible way to start.	2551.5	3.84
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:32:56] Tobias Carlisle: That’s where I am.	2555.34	0.949
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:32:57] Stig Brodersen: Yes, right. So I like  the price for sure. I like the free cash flow.	2556.289	6.731
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	That’s amazing. You already mentioned the  capital allocation with the buyback of shares,	2564.58	7.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	just from 2021 to 2022, the win from  117 million to 104 million share,	2573.58	5.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	like, it’s material. And like you mentioned, the  yield right now is more than 5% under dividends.	2579.46	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:33:18] Stig Brodersen: So this is  really interesting what’s going on.	2584.56	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	They say that time is a friend of a great  company and the enemy of a bad company.	2592.66	4.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	And I don’t really know how to put this like  this is not a company that’s 10 times bigger	2596.74	12.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	in 10 years. That’s not the business model at  all. But whenever you look at how cheap it is,	2608.92	5.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	like there’s so much catastrophe priced into the  price probably cause of the regulatory headwinds.	2614.68	6.633
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:33:42] Stig Brodersen: And so I don’t know  what the probability of this of the s e c,	2621.313	6.987
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	waving the white flag. I would not estimate it’s  that great. But if they did like the stock price	2628.3	6.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	would just, go to the moon and something like  this. And even if they don’t structurally change	2634.96	7.02
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	what’s going on with virtue, I would say that you  are priced in for something good to, to happen.	2641.98	8.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:34:00] Stig Brodersen: Seems like  they have gotten a lot of headwinds from	2652.18	3.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	retailers for retail investors like you  mentioned. But they, I can see they also do	2656.92	5.4
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a fair amount of business for institutional  clients, which is interesting in itself.	2662.32	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I would also imagine that they would benefit from  a secular trend of just more trading in general.	2671.26	5.673
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:34:17] Stig Brodersen: I’m not so much  talking about what happened during the pandemic,	2676.933	3.207
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but just I pull up some stats here. The  average holding period for individual	2680.14	4.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	stocks in the US is now 10 months and down  for five years, back in the 1970s. Now,	2684.28	5.7
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	by itself, that gives you a lot of volume and  the level of volume as, as well as volatility.	2691.24	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:34:35] Stig Brodersen: I had a conversation  with Mohnish about the Turkey stock mine. He	2698.38	3.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	said that the average holding period was  nine days. I don’t think it’s going to be	2701.62	4.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	similar to that here, but I don’t know if  it’s too easy to extrapolate and say it’s	2706.6	6.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	probably going to be shoulder than 10  months more than the other way around.	2712.66	2.373
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:34:49] Stig Brodersen: Who knows?  If I had to guess, I’ll probably say	2715.033	2.967
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it would be in that direction. So it has  a lot of tailwinds working for them, so	2718.0	8.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	yeah, it’s definitely like the  valuation let me put it like that.	2727.36	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:35:01] Tobias Carlisle: It’s peak uncertainty  for this business. It’s peak uncertainty and	2732.1	5.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a cyclical trough. And so I think that you  remove the uncertainty and you get some event,	2737.14	9.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	or there’s just an increase in volatility,  and that’s a, they’re a beneficiary of that.	2746.26	4.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:35:17] Tobias Carlisle: In the interim, you’re  getting paid a little dividend and they’re buying	2750.94	3.84
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	back stock. So that just means that when the  event happens, the move will be pretty big.	2754.78	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	The risk is that the s e  c does something material.	2760.12	3.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I mean, the world’s notice is a serious thing.  We don’t know exactly what happens with that, but	2765.04	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I don’t think that it’s ultimately going  to be destructive to their business.	2770.44	4.952
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:35:37] Tobias Carlisle: I think they’ll  negotiate something just because the sheer	2775.392	2.488
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	complexity of these businesses, the s e c needs  to be careful when they’re dealing with them.	2777.88	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So I think that on balance, it’s a  good, it’s good, it’s a good trade	2783.16	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	looking out over the next few years. But  as you point out, it’s not a compounder.	2787.9	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:35:53] Tobias Carlisle: They pay out  what they earn. Basically the payout comes in	2793.0	4.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	dividends and buybacks. I like those two things.  I like, when companies are returning capital,	2797.98	5.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the, I don’t like the cap the share  structure. I don’t like the, and it’s	2803.62	4.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	all a little bit strange with  the minorities in there as well.	2809.44	2.612
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:36:07] Tobias Carlisle: It’s  not perfectly clean. It’s not an	2812.052	2.248
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	easy company to analyze and it’s already  a reasonably complex financial business.	2814.3	3.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So it suffers from those things that also  pushes down the valuation. But I think that,	2818.08	5.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that idea that you sort of sell the rumor by  the news, I think that this is one of those	2825.76	4.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	situations where everybody’s worried about  what will happen when they get some clarity.	2830.68	4.112
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:36:26] Tobias Carlisle:  Probably with an event,	2834.792	2.068
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	probably it does reasonably well  over a short to medium term.	2837.46	3.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	But I don’t want to be holding, I mean, if I’m  not going to be holding this thing forever.	2842.26	3.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:36:35] Stig Brodersen: Alright,  so let’s go here to my pick as we are	2847.18	130.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	letting Hari go. And so my pick is a  small Swedish stock called Teqnion.	2977.74	7.604
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:36:45] Stig Brodersen: Full disclaimer,  I’m long Teqnion, so I won’t be trading at	2985.344	5.056
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	all the next 30 days. That would make me  a long term in Turkey apparently. But we	2990.4	5.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	have these guidelines here and so I won’t be  trusting that for the next 30 days. But I am	2996.16	3.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	long Teqnion and this will be gone out June 3rd.	3000.96	3.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:37:00] Stig Brodersen: So Teqnion is  trading on the small Scandinavian Exchange,	3006.0	4.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	nest stock first North under the ticker  TEQ. And if you’re based in the US can be	3010.14	5.94
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	borrow of the calendar through intact Brokers  child swap and whatnot. And so, the stock…	3016.08	7.352
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:37:15] Tobias Carlisle: How small is it?	3023.432	0.868
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:37:16] Stig Brodersen:  It is $267 million dollars.	3024.96	4.412
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:37:21] Tobias Carlisle: US?	3029.372	0.598
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:37:21] Stig Brodersen: US, Correct and it’s  opposite your pick. I, at least I hope because	3029.97	11.31
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it’s very expensive, whereas your pick was very  cheap. But it, I hope that it’s a compounder and	3041.28	8.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the stock really came on my radar after listening  to Clay interview Chris Mayer, on episode 543.	3049.56	7.053
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:37:37] Stig Brodersen: And he also wrote  the book a 100 Baggers and I tuned into the	3056.613	6.327
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	episode because I thought I’d be learning about  Constellation software which I also did, but	3062.94	4.02
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that was actually not really piqued my interest  after going through Chris’s portfolio. Teqnion was	3068.16	5.7
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	really what I was interested in and. We already  talked about that it’s a very small stock.	3073.86	9.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:37:57] Stig Brodersen: Not a lot of people  have heard about it. Also the reporting is mainly	3082.92	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	in Swedish, so, so that also limits the field  and I’d send Tobi and Hari before this call,	3088.02	8.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I sent the, my Google translated version of the  reporting and I do like that it’s a little odd.	3096.84	10.02
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	As a Dane I do have a home field advantage given  it it’s in Swedish, but as a value investor,	3106.86	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	regardless, I’m always excited to go that  extra mile and look when no one else is,	3112.68	5.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I’ll make sure to link to that  Google translated any report.	3119.22	3.633
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:38:26] Stig Brodersen: I’ll also make sure  to link to the Swedish version if anyone would	3122.853	3.507
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	be interested in that. The business model  of Teqnion is, it’s simple but not easy.	3126.36	8.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	And so, these days you will  call them a serial acquirer	3135.48	3.54
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and for the companies that they have in their  portfolio, have, they have 24 right now.	3139.56	4.713
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:38:44] Stig Brodersen: They don’t expect  a lot of, again, growth especially not	3144.273	4.587
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	adjusted for inflation. They grow through  acquisitions, which by definition is just	3148.86	5.52
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	b really hard. And the intention is  to get the money back in five years.	3154.92	6.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	They pay everything in cash with 60 to 7% up  upfront and the rest in the two year earnout.	3162.3	5.43
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:39:03] Stig Brodersen: And that cash is  financed 50% eternally and 50% by bank debt.	3167.73	6.03
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	And they would typically prefer  to keep the existing management	3174.78	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and then in case they take control of the  board. That’s not always possible because,	3179.82	5.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	sometimes the owners want to run into the sunset.  And so it will be their job to find a replacement.	3184.98	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:39:21] Stig Brodersen: Generally the  target companies are small industrial	3191.16	2.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	companies with [inaudible] and  pricing power in these industries.	3195.06	3.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	They want to grow and they have these financial  targets and perhaps those three financial targets	3212.22	4.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	will also give you a good idea of where they  are. So, net debt to EBITDA lower than 2.5.	3217.14	4.533
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:39:37] Stig Brodersen: It’s 1.5. Ok, sorry,  its 1.1 At the moment EBITA. So without the D,	3221.673	5.787
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the higher than 9%, it’s 11 at the moment. And  through that, as a result of that, they want to	3227.46	6.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	double the EPS at least every five years. And so  that’s sort of like the, that’s the structure.	3233.58	8.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	If you look at the 2022 report, stock  prices up by 456% here at the end of 2022.	3243.6	7.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:39:59] Stig Brodersen: And since then,  at the time of recording went up another	3252.54	2.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	20%. And note that’s not 20% as in 456  plus 20%, it’s 456 times 1.2. So there’s	3255.12	8.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	some rocket fuel tied to this stock and  who knows? Perhaps it reflects that it’s	3266.4	3.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	just very expensive, or perhaps it’s a  reflection of a very strong business.	3270.18	3.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:40:19] Stig Brodersen: The business of  acquiring businesses is just notoriously	3277.2	5.52
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	difficult. Whenever you look at value creation  for holistic companies, the shareholders of the	3282.72	8.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	acquiring company typically do not gain any  value. If you run a long time series, all the	3292.14	6.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	value goes to the shareholders of the target  company. And the reason why is quite simple.	3298.2	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:40:42] Stig Brodersen: Synergies are  overvalued. Cost cutting isn’t as easy as	3304.86	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	you typically thought. And there’s also  an element of management vanity in that.	3310.86	6.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I read about one CEO who called it, I think he  called it company dating, or he said, it’s so	3317.88	11.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	romantic because that’s sort of like what you do  whenever you shove around for companies, cause it,	3329.46	5.52
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it’s more fun to buy and take over another  company than is to do your daily operations.	3334.98	5.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:41:08] Stig Brodersen: If you buy listed  companies, you have to pay a premium to the	3342.42	3.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	existing shareholders of the acquiring company.  That, and you are paying for that if you’re an	3345.6	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	existing shareholder in a company. And so you  might say, well, how does that relate to being	3350.04	5.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a private company? Well, if you typically, and  Joe Buffett talked about this, he talks about	3355.5	6.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	how difficult it is to get private companies for  real good price because you typically speak with	3362.16	5.7
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	very sophisticated sellers. It’s not like  the stock market where sometimes the market	3367.86	5.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	is going crazy and sometimes you can’t find  a bargain, even though, again, as if you’re	3373.44	3.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	acquiring an entire company, you have to do a  tender office so you don’t get the same discount.	3377.1	3.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	And so you might be thinking whenever you’re  hearing this but Stig, you just said there at	3381.18	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the top that there was a five year payback period  and you also said there was a difficult buying	3385.38	4.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	private companies. How does, how do you square  that circle? And I think there are different ways	3390.24	6.84
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to look at that, and the track record has shown  that it is indeed possible for Teqnion to do that.	3397.08	5.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:42:03] Stig Brodersen: First of all, there  are not a lot of potential acquirers of small	3402.66	5.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Swedish companies and that is the main market for  Teqnion. That’s where most of their businesses	3409.14	6.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	are located. They’ve done very few acquisitions  outside. And also think you need to understand	3415.74	15.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the Swedish culture a bit more to understand  how these somewhat bar bargains can occur.	3431.64	8.7
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:42:25] Stig Brodersen: So I should probably  also say at top, I used to live in Sweden, so	3441.84	4.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that’s why I tend to think that I know a bit about  the country and also live in Denmark. But anyways,	3446.64	4.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the Swedish culture is together with the  other Scandinavian countries characterized	3453.18	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	by high level of trust. It’s somewhat easier to  decentralize, which is a big component of this,	3457.92	6.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	especially if you’re going to have so many  subsidiaries that have 24 at the moment.	3464.4	3.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:42:47] Stig Brodersen: Succession is very  difficult for well generally succession is	3469.5	4.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	very difficult for all companies, especially  very small companies. But I would say that,	3473.88	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	so most of the companies that are acquiring their  family businesses, depending on which country you	3478.08	5.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	live in, you’ll probably see, you’ll probably  experience that there are different expectations	3483.84	4.32
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	by those parents for the kids to take that over.  In Scandinavia there are no such expectation	3489.3	4.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	for you to do so. You are more encouraged to  paint your own canvas and follow your dreams.	3495.06	6.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:43:16] Stig Brodersen: And I would say if the  US were your point of reference, I would say it’s	3502.92	6.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	way more prevalent than in the US which is already	3510.48	2.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	quite prevalent whenever you  compared to other countries.	3512.82	3.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:43:26] Stig Brodersen: Equality is a core  value in the Swedish society. You don’t want	3517.32	14.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to strive for money to an excessive amount. You  would probably be looked down upon if you talk too	3531.9	5.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	much about money and you that you probably just  state that you have ambitious financial goals.	3537.78	5.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	And I think it would surprise a lot of  people that is the culture in Scandinavia.	3543.9	4.653
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:43:47] Stig Brodersen: And so  money is perceived as a comparable	3548.553	5.727
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	small role. It doesn’t play a big role once you  read a bit more than middle class in Scandinavia.	3555.12	6.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	And so let me come up with a simplified  example of how this could come into play.	3561.24	5.7
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Pretend that you are living in a small village,  a thousand people by a thousand people.	3568.26	3.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:44:07] Stig Brodersen: You want to take your  tips off the table. Your business is generating	3571.92	5.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a million dollars in annual free Tesla, and you  don’t want to do whatever you’re doing anymore.	3577.5	6.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Would you like to sell to a private fund for  8 million or sell to Teqnion for 5 million? I	3586.2	5.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	think you would be surprised of how  many that would go for the lower offer.	3592.74	3.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:44:26] Stig Brodersen: Whenever  you are dealing with a company like	3595.92	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Teqnion who promised not to put a lot of debt on  your balance sheet, not to sell it off. It’s a	3600.36	7.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	very different discussion. If you have a small  business, you probably have your accountant be	3607.86	8.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a good friend of yours and you might go  to the same club or whatever is the case.	3616.14	3.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:44:44] Stig Brodersen: If you go with some  of the private equity companies, they will do a	3620.58	3.42
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	lot. They were centralized a lot. That’s not the  case for Teqnion at all. So this was just a very	3624.0	5.94
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	simplistic example of why this why  you have this, the case here and	3630.54	5.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it’s simply also very difficult if you  live in a place like that and a lot of	3636.84	4.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	these small industrial companies  are located in a place like that.	3641.1	2.553
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:45:04] Stig Brodersen: It’s very difficult  for you, for yourself to find a replacement to	3643.653	4.047
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	take over the CEO role for something like that.  So Teqnion is simple, but it’s not easy and you	3647.7	10.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	definitely need the right people to execute on  that strategy. So I have a really long section	3658.08	7.32
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	about different risk factors and valuation but I  kind of feel, I’ve been rambling for so long now,	3665.4	5.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	so I’m going through it to you,  Tobi. Any thoughts and reflections?	3671.16	3.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:45:29] Tobias Carlisle: I think  the challenge with these businesses	3674.88	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	is always that you are relying  on the acquisition discipline of	3679.32	4.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the management team. And as long as their  rules concrete and they continue to apply them,	3684.72	7.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	then they should do pretty well. I think there are  lots of examples of constellation, the Canadian	3693.6	9.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	company that buys the, famously buys the vertical  market software. Little tiny little businesses in	3703.5	11.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Australia and Canada. The roll ups have never sort  of worked that well because I don’t know why we	3715.26	4.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	overpay or they tend to be siloed in one industry,  so they’re just, they end up just paying more	3719.76	6.72
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and more for these businesses when the thing that  makes them succeed is discipline on what they pay.	3726.48	6.572
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:46:17] Tobias Carlisle: I agree with you that	3733.052	1.588
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the negotiated sale price tends to mean in  the public markets particularly, and often in	3735.36	6.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	competitive private equity markets, they tend to  pay at least a fair price, and they make up they	3741.72	7.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	generate their returns by layering in some debt  and then paying off the debt and then dressing	3749.52	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	them up a little bit for sale and trying to get  them, trying to sell them at the right time.	3754.86	3.272
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:46:39] Tobias Carlisle: But as a	3758.132	2.128
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	kind of proposition, like clearly  that’s what Berkshire Hathaway is like,	3761.1	3.3
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	acquiring discipline, not overpaying for things.  Incentivizing the managers appropriately so that	3765.48	7.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	they continue to run the businesses, send all the  free cash flow up to Warren Buffett, who redeploys	3772.86	6.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it sensibly. Do that for a really long period  of time, generate absolutely fabulous returns.	3778.98	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:47:03] Tobias Carlisle: The two ways  that you can go wrong, too much debt	3786.36	4.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and overpaying that will kill you, and that  applies also for someone in investing in	3790.5	5.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	these businesses. You need to be getting  a pretty good, not a good, you just need	3796.14	3.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to get the right price. You need to pay the  right price for them so that your own returns	3800.04	3.54
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	look a little bit more like the  underlying returns of the business.	3804.12	2.672
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:47:21] Tobias Carlisle: You’re just not  overpaying the, I don’t know, the valuation	3806.792	3.448
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of this business. That would be the main risk  that I would see if they’ve got a good track	3810.24	5.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	record of making acquisitions and their rules are  concrete and they seem inclined to follow them,	3815.88	5.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and they’re an acquirer of choice. If  someone will sell for them, sell to them	3822.36	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	for five times when there’s another acquirer  out there prepared to pay eight times, that’s.	3826.8	4.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:47:42] Tobias Carlisle: That’s,	3830.88	1.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that means that they’re getting a lot of value  every time they’re buying and they’re probably	3832.56	3.42
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	going to do very well. It’s it sounds really  interesting to me. It’s when I was young,	3835.98	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	when I graduated from law school, this was  exactly the kind of thing that I wanted to do.	3840.18	3.212
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:47:53] Tobias Carlisle: Cause I  thought it was a really interesting,	3843.392	1.588
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I thought it would’ve been a fun business to  manage. I did a few, as a corporate advisory	3846.72	4.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	lawyer, I did a few buyouts and just saw how  much effort there is in making an acquisition.	3851.58	6.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	And then we had to, when the acquisition  failed, we worked on the other. I mean,	3858.24	4.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	when the business failed cause, it was, had  too much debt and they been in a price war.	3862.86	4.232
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:48:12] Tobias Carlisle: We worked on the  other side to, to pull them apart. And that	3867.092	3.148
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	was at that time that I could just see comparable  businesses on the stock exchange trading for three	3870.24	6.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	times where the EBITDA when they had to pay six  times to get control of this thing. And I thought,	3876.36	5.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	what if you just bought the ones  that were cheaper on the market?	3882.12	2.852
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:48:27] Tobias Carlisle: And that’s sort of  the entire reason that I have written the books,	3884.972	2.788
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that I haven’t run the business that I  do because I do like, I love this stuff.	3887.76	3.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	It sounds like a really interesting  opportunity. I’m going to keep an	3892.44	2.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	eye on it. I don’t know much about it  other than what you’ve just said, but	3894.78	3.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	there’s no reason why it wouldn’t work  other than overpaying in too much debt.	3899.22	4.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:48:44] Stig Brodersen: Yeah, it’s one of  those things that, are simple but not easy.	3903.78	6.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Keeping that discipline would be tough. And so,  so we definitely have different risk factors.	3911.46	6.3
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So we have Johan, who is the CEO, and  Daniel who is the Chief Acquisition Officer.	3919.08	4.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I don’t know if I offend anyone in the  company, if I say that they run the show,	3927.18	3.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but there’s definitely some key main risk there.	3931.32	2.553
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:49:03] Stig Brodersen: And if one  of them would depart, I would seriously	3933.873	3.147
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	consider whether or not it would still make  sense to be in, to be invested. Because so	3937.02	4.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	much of the value in Teqnion is future growth.  Right now it’s trading at 26P of 26. And so	3941.58	7.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	you really have to have a lot of faith  in the. Long runway of the business.	3949.86	5.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:49:22] Stig Brodersen: Johan started  the company in 2006 with his friend Jonas,	3955.08	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	who is no longer part of the company. Johan’s  parents are still pretty big shareholders	3959.82	5.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and they didn’t really have a lot of  high degree of inside ownership. Johan	3964.86	4.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	still owns 5% of the company today.  He has a background as a mechanical	3969.54	5.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	engineer and speaks really the jargon  of the company that they acquire.	3974.76	4.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:49:43] Stig Brodersen: It’s the type  of business where if you meet up in a suit,	3978.84	6.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it might be a lot harder to acquire  that company. There’s a lot of,	3985.02	5.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it’s not just a cold business transaction with  these small companies that they’re acquiring.	3990.24	4.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So Johan just comes with a load, loads of trust  and knows how it is to run a small business.	3996.3	5.313
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:49:58] Stig Brodersen:  And I should also say this	4001.613	3.627
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	before we move on. I had the opportunity to meet  up with the management in Omaha and they were	4007.28	10.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	just fantastic people. Johan and Daniel and  I actually met Tobi that night at one of our	4017.78	5.52
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	events and told Tobi like this is not good.  I met the management now, which I never do.	4023.3	5.321
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:50:18] Tobias Carlisle: You’ve fallen in love.	4028.621	0.052
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:50:19] Stig Brodersen: Yeah, I’m falling  in love and Buffett never takes my calls but	4028.673	6.327
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	you know we were in a lucky situation and  Daniel was a big fan of the podcast and,	4035.0	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I got in touch with him and he was just like,  Oh my God, let’s hang out and talk about	4040.82	3.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	business and so I had a bunch of questions  to them and they were just amazing answers.	4044.42	6.873
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:50:36] Stig Brodersen: And I  have all the biases that you could	4051.293	2.847
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	have, it’s terrible. I read Daniel’s book after  meeting them and which is a wonderful book too,	4055.04	11.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and. He talks about that if you  fall in love with the company,	4066.14	3.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	do not buy any shares in that company in the next  30 days. And so I want to live by that, not just	4069.74	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	because it’s a rule with TIP that you cannot  do it whenever you go public with the stock.	4075.74	3.513
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:50:57] Stig Brodersen: But also  because I just think it’s, it makes sense,	4079.253	3.267
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a lot of CEOs it wasn’t the case  with Johan who found the company,	4083.72	4.32
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but a lot of CEOs became CEOs because they were  great salespeople. Everyone liked them and so,	4088.04	5.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	so you have to be mindful of that. But  again, really impressed by the management.	4093.62	5.493
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:51:14] Stig Brodersen: Daniel owns 0.24% of  the company and he bought all the shares on the	4099.113	6.327
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	open market, NorthStar options for Daniel, it’s  the Berkshire Hathaway approach. And a lot that	4105.44	5.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	he has a background from Bain McKenzie  the like, but he doesn’t come across as	4111.2	5.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that type of consultant. It’s  actually tremendous compliment.	4118.04	2.673
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:51:31] Stig Brodersen: I don’t know if I  saw anyone by saying so, but I that, that he	4120.713	6.207
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	has that background because it really helps you  in dissecting a lot of companies really fast.	4126.92	4.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I would also say that whenever I meet up  with people, I like to test them if I’m	4134.66	5.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	going to do business with them, obviously  you’re not going to phrase it as a test,	4139.7	3.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but you want to know if the top  management understand capital allocation.	4144.02	4.113
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:51:53] Stig Brodersen: Well, and so I  had like this, I should say that the company	4148.133	5.907
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	do have a stock option program, and last  year it was 0.1% of shares is outstanding,	4154.04	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	which to the best of a knowledge game was not part  of. He said that he bought all the open market,	4160.04	4.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but I talked to him about that to him  and Johan about that options program.	4164.3	5.253
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:52:11] Stig Brodersen:  And I said something like	4169.553	1.827
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	long and complicated which probably sounds  super arrogant if you’re listen ng, tuning in,	4171.98	4.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but I sort, I asked that question. It was  about a European style call option with a	4176.24	5.52
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	strike price out of money something. I did  it to test the management because whenever	4181.76	8.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	you ask a ridiculous question like that, you  typically get three different types of responses.	4189.8	4.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:52:31] Stig Brodersen: The first one is  they have no idea what you’re talking about.	4195.92	2.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So they just start to BS you. You don’t want that  because that means that they’re also going to be	4198.74	7.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	as whatever else that they’re doing. They probably  don’t have a healthy corporate culture if they do	4206.18	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that. The other response you can get is that they  just say, I don’t understand what you’re saying.	4212.18	6.54
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:52:48] Stig Brodersen: That’s okay. That’s  completely okay. But that also tells you something	4218.72	4.02
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	because that tells you that they’re honest  and humble, which is typically also signals	4222.74	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that they have good, a good corporate culture  because something like that, that humility	4228.74	4.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	trickles down throughout the entire  organization. And then you also have	4235.52	2.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the third option that they actually  do understand what you’re saying.	4238.4	2.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:53:05] Stig Brodersen: And  Daniel understood that he had	4240.68	2.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	no problem understanding all the rambling I  was doing. So I was impressed by Daniel and	4243.44	6.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Johan. Daniel stayed a very cheap hotel outside  of the city. I looked it up whenever they told me	4282.26	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	where they were staying. I really like that. As a  shareholder, you want the management to be frugal.	4287.6	4.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:53:23] Stig Brodersen: Alternatively, you can  be the McLennan’s of the world if you do have the	4292.58	4.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	cash, but he travels on his own dime, so I don’t  care if he goes private or whatever he does.	4297.08	3.84
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	They talked about how they were tired. They were,	4312.14	2.94
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	because they were doing like three different  flights and what up too early in the morning.	4315.08	3.224
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:53:36] Stig Brodersen: And I was like,	4318.304	1.696
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	they didn’t have to. But it said something  to me about the culture. And then again,	4320.0	6.54
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the company has 452 employees seven people  in the HQ. The HQ have rented a coworking	4327.56	7.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	space in the suburbs of Stockholm. It’s  just another wonderful observation.	4335.48	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	And they also include the expense for the HQ  as a presenter of sales in the annual report.	4340.34	5.733
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:54:01] Stig Brodersen: That’s not  something that you typically see. So the	4346.073	4.107
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	level of transparency is just absolutely  wonderful. So I also want to say that the	4350.18	7.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	bet is very much on the manage spend. I guess  it always is, especially because it’s priced	4357.98	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	relatively high with a P of 26 right now. And  so you have to be, had to be mindful of that.	4363.8	7.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:54:20] Stig Brodersen: So let’s talk about  the valuation. Like you mentioned before, I don’t	4371.66	66.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	feel that the current portfolio justifies a P of  26. If price is your margin of safety, you should	4438.44	7.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	probably go with something like, like Tobi’s pick.  I like that much better, like a low single digital	4445.88	5.4
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	multiple. But time should be the  friend of this wonderful company.	4454.04	4.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:54:41] Stig Brodersen: So if you run  the numbers, the type of stock return	4460.04	7.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	is very much correlated with the return on  invest capital, which like I mentioned before,	4471.32	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	is well above 20% has been for some  time you have low leverage. So you	4475.52	5.7
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	have to count on that for a very long time.  And so I if you’re talking about decades,	4481.22	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it doesn’t matter too much if the P is 10 or 50,  like if you go long enough and the return invested	4486.26	6.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	capital is high, it gravitates toward your return,  I should say incremental return on that capital.	4492.32	6.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:55:10] Stig Brodersen: And so for example, if  this company grows 10% of year, the next 10 years,	4499.28	6.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and then trades are the multiple of 10, You  don’t really make any money. You break even.	4506.06	4.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So in opportunity cost, that would be  a terrible decision. If you feel that	4510.44	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	they can do this for 20 years, returning 20%  a year, and then trades at trade at P of 20,	4514.88	8.4
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	which depending on the interest rate level  may or may not be realistic, you are at 18.3%.	4523.28	5.744
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:55:37] Stig Brodersen: And so it very much  goes in line with how long is that runway.	4529.024	5.116
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	How do you think they can continue to have the  discipline whenever they’re acquiring companies.	4534.14	4.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	So where does all of that leave  us? If you look at the return	4540.26	13.32
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	from an index, roughly five, seven ish percent  of that comes from a, from very few stocks.	4554.9	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:55:56] Stig Brodersen: It’s thinking about the  Amazon and Alphabets of the world and you have the	4560.9	6.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	index driving that appreciation because the index  is too dumb to sell the best performing companies.	4567.26	7.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Whereas we as investors tend to call off flowers  and waring the weeds as Peter Lynch would say.	4574.34	5.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	You want to buy those high quality  companies for single digit multiples.	4581.72	4.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:56:18] Stig Brodersen: It’s tough. I’m not  saying it can’t be done, but unless you’re doing	4586.22	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	some sort of investing in some sort of crazy  turnaround, it’s close to impossible. So you	4590.66	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	have to pay up and you have to have faith in that  long runway. So is this one of those companies?	4596.48	7.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I would like to say yes. It  may and may not be the case.	4606.44	3.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:56:38] Stig Brodersen: I just wanted to add  one more thing here before I throw it over to you,	4611.24	3.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Tobi, I really, I keep on talking about  this wonderful management, but I just want	4614.36	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to throw more numbers at you. Compensation  is relatively low, even by SW standards.	4619.46	7.02
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	And so if you compare it to other  companies, unless it’s perhaps	4628.7	3.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Berkshire and how Buffett compensates  themselves you just wouldn’t believe it.	4633.62	4.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:56:59] Stig Brodersen: So the CEO in 2022,  he was paid 140,000 in base, $140,000 in base,	4639.8	7.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and he received a 120 thousand bonus. So that  was a record year and the way that bonus is	4647.3	5.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	being calculated is that it’s a split on the  profit they made compared to the previous three	4653.18	7.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	years. So the benchmark keeps on going up, and  that’s the case for everyone in the management,	4661.1	8.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	seven people in HQ, but also  the CEO of this specific area.	4671.0	3.513
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:57:25] Stig Brodersen: So I  that’s the way it’s being run.	4674.513	3.027
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	The chairman of the board was paid $20,000 for  his time. The others paid between 10 and 14. And	4678.14	8.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Johan being the CEO, he was not paid at all for  being on the board. And so, believe it or not,	4686.18	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	this was like my short version of my, of  going through the company together with you.	4691.52	6.84
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:57:46] Stig Brodersen: I did do an interview  with Daniel, the Chief Acquisition Officer that	4698.36	4.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	was published a few weeks ago. I’m sure to  link to that. It’s on YouTube right now,	4703.28	3.42
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but I’m sure to link to that in the show  notes but let me throw it over to you, Tobi.	4707.3	4.02
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:57:58] Tobias Carlisle: I mean, I like  all of the risks are always that management’s	4711.32	7.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	taking up more than they’re  earning for the shareholders.	4720.08	3.932
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:58:05] Tobias Carlisle: And there’s,  that’s the norm rather than the exception.	4724.012	6.568
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	That they overpay, that they don’t know what  they’re doing. There’s too much debt. Sounds	4731.6	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	like all of those things are not there. They sound  like my kind of guys, honestly, I don’t know much	4735.8	7.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	about it other than what you’ve said today. But  all of that sounds very promising for those guys.	4743.36	4.052
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:58:22] Tobias Carlisle: The valuation, when  you say it’s a 26 times PE and you say that the	4747.412	7.288
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	e is pretty close to cash flow, so it’s like a 4%  free cash flow yield growing at about 20% a year,	4754.7	11.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	maybe a little bit more than that potentially.  So interest rates, currently 5% of the 10 years.	4766.34	6.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Let’s see, year, you’re a few years  until you’re earning at the 10 years.	4773.9	5.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:58:48] Tobias Carlisle: I think the, for  me, that would be the only thing that would be,	4779.06	4.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	maybe you could get, maybe you could put  on a partial position and then wait for	4784.04	8.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a better price. Maybe that better price  never comes. Like there’s plenty of people	4792.08	3.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	who are waiting for that better price  for Berkshire and it just never came.	4795.98	2.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:59:05] Tobias Carlisle: I’m pretty bad  at paying up for things, so I sometimes I	4800.24	6.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	miss some of these better opportunities, so  totally don’t listen to me with the mistake.	4806.72	3.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:59:14] Stig Brodersen: I still have a  strong bias toward not doing it. It’s so	4809.78	19.26
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	easy to see something in that single digit range,  and you can see the cast load and you can see the	4829.04	6.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	shareholder yield it, it looks so  good and it just makes so much sense.	4837.2	3.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:59:27] Stig Brodersen: I tend to be a  numbers guy and not a qualitative guy, so	4841.4	4.38
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I’m practicing. I don’t necessarily  think I, I do a good job.	4847.04	3.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I’d probably say for people who  might be interested in this stock,	4853.46	5.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	build your position slowly by very few shares  and at whenever you learn more about the company.	4858.5	8.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:59:46] Tobias Carlisle: There’s  a macro we didn’t mention this,	4872.0	52.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but there’s I do think that there is this sort  of macro trend that is worth observing here.	4924.2	5.672
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[00:59:53] Tobias Carlisle: That there  is a, in the western world in particular,	4929.872	3.508
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	there is a baby boomer generation that is aging  and exiting the workforce and they will need to	4933.38	8.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	transition these businesses to someone else.  And we, there are a lot of people talking	4941.6	6.42
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	about at the moment, but having said that, I  remember 20 years ago they were talking about	4948.02	4.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	this too, that there would be this transition and  doesn’t seem to have really kind of happened yet.	4952.1	6.212
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:00:18] Tobias Carlisle: So it’s,  but it must happen at some point.	4958.312	2.248
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	There will be, there must be a way of  solving that problem as they transition.	4962.66	3.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	If these guys have got a solution to it,  then I think that’s an interesting trend	4966.14	4.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that’s worth sort of watching closely anyway.  And probably this is a good way of playing it.	4970.64	7.112
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:00:33] Tobias Carlisle: These guys are in a  good position to take some of these middle market,	4977.752	3.988
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	smaller businesses. Need a home, need the  administrative help. Because often businesses,	4981.74	7.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and this was something I found as a, as an  activist, particularly in Australia, where many of	4989.54	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the smaller listed companies are run by founders  who are engineering typically as a background,	4995.36	5.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	haven’t spent as much time in financial  markets and don’t know about buybacks and	5001.42	4.02
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	all that, the other levers that you can  pull to improve your shareholder value.	5005.44	2.912
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:00:59] Tobias Carlisle: Not saying that they  would need to consider that as private businesses,	5008.352	3.628
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I’m just saying that they’re engineering types  rather than financial guys. And so it can be a	5011.98	4.98
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	good marriage where you have a financial  guy that’s helped with an engineering	5016.96	3.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	team that sort of runs the underlying business.  And this might be that kind of opportunity.	5020.68	6.42
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:01:16] Stig Brodersen: I like that you say  that and I had a discussion with the management	5028.24	6.84
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	about that not just the way that they’re  being compensated, but also the way that	5035.08	4.02
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the CEOs were compensated at the subsidiary  level. And we talked about this whole	5040.12	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	stock option issue. And I would  prefer not that to be the case at all,	5047.92	5.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but if it were to happen, perhaps  you could be structured X, Y, Z.	5053.8	3.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:01:38] Stig Brodersen: And they  looked at me and they said, just	5056.8	4.02
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	what you were going at before. Like  they’re engineers by trade. Like they	5060.82	4.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	don’t necessarily think of strike prices and  is its American type of co-option or is its	5065.32	6.3
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	European style or whatever. Like they don’t  think about like that, just like payment cash.	5071.62	4.92
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:01:55] Stig Brodersen: If a rich ex number  of dollars in profit, I get more. That’s enough.	5076.54	7.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	And so I think that’s very telling. And I  also feel things very telling that whenever	5084.28	5.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	they do the internal reporting, so  they do that once a month with the	5089.44	2.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	subsidiaries. At the very top of their  income statement. They have profits.	5092.08	3.693
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:02:13] Stig Brodersen: They don’t have  revenue. They do stream once a quarter. And	5095.773	6.567
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I checked out the last, I don’t know, five,  six. I think that’s probably what they have	5102.34	3.48
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	online now that’s in English where they talk  about why sale isn’t important. I know that	5105.82	7.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	sounds super counterintuitive probably, but  they feel that sales are more derivative of	5113.02	3.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the profits more than the other way around,  and it’s the way that they build a thesis.	5116.92	3.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:02:31] Stig Brodersen: I just tend to like,  especially, it’s probably not too much a problem	5119.92	3.84
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	here in 2023, but you don’t, you remember a  few years back it was all about revenue. No	5123.76	4.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	one cared about casts at all. And I like that  conservative approach and I asked them about	5128.56	5.52
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the interest rate and what that meant, that they  had a higher cost of capital and they said no.	5137.02	5.733
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:02:49] Stig Brodersen:  Payback period is still,	5142.753	1.347
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it’s still five years, it’s still 50% banded  and 50% cash. Like we need to make it simple.	5144.82	8.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I like that. I like that approach. I  think it makes it easier for everyone.	5155.14	4.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:03:00] Tobias Carlisle: Yeah. Couldn’t  agree more simple and concrete and	5159.76	5.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	incentivize so you don’t do silly things to  hit numbers but do the right things in the	5166.36	6.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	business. Yeah, those are all good things  to look out for in compensation plans.	5172.96	3.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:03:16] Stig Brodersen: So yeah, that  was that was my pick here for today.	5176.62	7.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:03:20] Tobias Carlisle: Teqnion.	5184.9	0.377
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:03:21] Stig Brodersen: Teqnion, yes.	5185.277	1.663
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:03:22] Tobias Carlisle: Good name.	5186.94	0.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:03:23] Stig Brodersen: Tobi, anything else  here before we wrap up the show? I would, as	5187.54	6.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	always, I would like to give you opportunity  to tell about you and what you’re up to.	5193.72	4.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Anything else you wanted to share  with the audience before we do?	5199.18	1.832
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:03:34] Tobias Carlisle: I think they’re really  good picks, reflective of who we are. We got	5201.012	4.228
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Palantir from Hari, got the tech company from  Hari, got the deep value financial from me and	5205.24	6.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the European, unknown European  stock for Stig. [Crosstalk]	5213.28	6.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:03:50] Stig Brodersen: Yeah. Well said.	5219.52	2.972
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:03:51] Tobias Carlisle: In  a different language. Perfect.	5222.492	0.061
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:03:53] Stig Brodersen: In a different  language. Perfect. Yeah. That’s the way I make	5222.553	5.427
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	sure you can’t criticize for too much. I send you  a reporting in a language you don’t understand so.	5227.98	2.912
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:03:59] Tobias Carlisle: I like it.	5230.892	0.961
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:04:01] Stig Brodersen: Alright, Tobi.	5231.853	2.787
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:04:04] Tobias Carlisle: I have a  website acquirersmultiple.com and that	5234.64	5.52
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	has I’ve written some books about  my investment process and research	5240.16	5.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that I’ve done by myself and with other people.	5245.74	2.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:04:16] Tobias Carlisle: I run two funds in the  states that domestic US equities have a mid-cap,	5249.82	5.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	large cap fund called The Acquirer’s  Fund. Ticket is ZIG and a small and	5255.7	5.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	micro-cap version of exactly the same  strategy. The ticker is DEP, D.E.P	5261.16	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and I’m on Twitter @Greenbackd,  G.R.E.E.N.B.A.C.K.D. We’re I post	5267.04	6.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a little bit and I spend a lot of time on  Twitter just sort of watching what’s happening.	5273.64	3.452
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:04:40] Tobias Carlisle: I post less and  less these days because I don’t really know	5277.092	4.528
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	what’s going on. I feel like there’s a fair bit  of deterioration under the hood in the global	5281.62	7.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	economy, and it doesn’t seem to be reflected  in stock prices. So I’m always pretty bearish	5288.82	4.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	though. So take that for grain of salt. Thanks for  having me, Stig. I always love chatting to you.	5293.68	5.744
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:04:58] Stig Brodersen: We’ve had  this mastermind discussions since	5299.424	6.676
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	2015 and I don’t remember you not being bearish,	5306.1	3.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	which I like in an uncertain world.  Tobi it’s good to know people like you.	5309.1	4.832
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:05:08] Tobias Carlisle: I want, because  I’m a deep value guy, I really want to pay	5313.932	5.248
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	really cheap prices. So I’m hopeful that at  some point we’ll have a gigantic collapse,	5319.18	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and then I’ll come on and I’ll be super  bullish where everybody else is bearish.	5325.0	4.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:05:21] Stig Brodersen: And you’re probably  right. If you look at any historic metric, it’s	5329.62	5.4
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	as much as the market has dropped,  even though at the time of recording,	5335.56	4.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	we’ve seen the rebound, like  it’s still really expensive.	5339.64	3.146
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:05:32] Tobias Carlisle: Well, we’re two  years in, ARC topped out in February 2021,	5342.786	3.694
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	so it’s more than two years ago. And the  rest of the market topped out at the end	5346.48	5.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of 22 or the beginning of 20, sorry, the end  of 21, beginning of 22. So we’re more than	5351.76	4.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	18 months into that drawdown. Historically,  when markets have collapsed, they look like	5356.44	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	this. They bump sideways for 18 months and  then the last third is the business end.	5362.44	5.792
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:05:56] Tobias Carlisle: And so we’re right  into that business end. I sort of think we’re	5368.232	3.448
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	going to see it in 2023 or very early in 2024,  but I think 2023 and soon for my 2 cents.	5371.68	9.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:06:08] Stig Brodersen: Time will tell.  Wonderful. Thank you so much for your time,	5380.68	3.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Tobi. I really appreciate it.	5384.58	1.444
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:06:12] Tobias Carlisle: Thanks for having  me, Stig. Love seeing you, love chatting.	5386.024	2.156
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:06:15] Stig Brodersen: All right guys,	5388.18	1.62
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I wanted to transition to the second  segment of the show and include my co-host,	5389.8	4.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Clay Finck for that, now that we are letting  go of Tobi and Hari. Clay, how are you today?	5394.48	5.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:06:27] Clay Finck: Doing wonderful,  Stig. Thank you. How are you?	5399.76	3.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:06:30] Stig Brodersen: I’m good. I  came back from Omaha not too long ago,	5403.0	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	as you can probably hear here on my voice.	5407.74	2.253
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:06:34] Stig Brodersen: So this is this  is being published June 3rd and actually	5409.993	3.807
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	recorded before the mastermind meeting that  you heard before with Tobi and Hari because	5413.8	6.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	we came back and we got a lot of wonderful  feedback from our audience and we had these	5419.86	4.32
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	four free events from Thursday to Sunday in  Omaha where we met the listeners of the show.	5424.18	4.533
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:06:51] Stig Brodersen: And, we talked about  investing life, everything else in between,	5428.713	4.767
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and it just had a wonderful time there. And one  of the things that we heard from the community was	5433.48	7.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that they really liked the Mastermind episodes,  and I wanted to use that as to transition into a	5440.68	6.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	discussion of our mastermind community, which  it seemed like not a lot of people knew about.	5447.64	4.773
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:07:12] Stig Brodersen: It’s also  very new and it’s something that,	5452.413	2.667
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that you initiated. So perhaps Clay, let’s start  with that. What is the TIP Mastermind Community?	5455.08	6.54
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:07:20] Clay Finck: Yeah. I’d like to tell a  little bit of a story here to paint a picture,	5461.62	6.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	paint a background of where we’re coming  from, Stig. When we were planning the	5467.74	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Berkshire weekend and what TIP events  we wanted to host for the audience.	5473.08	4.477
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:07:35] Clay Finck: You asked that I help  organize a few meetups in Omaha, which completely	5477.557	5.063
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	makes sense because I’m familiar with the area.  I used to live in Omaha, so logistically it just	5482.62	5.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	made a lot of sense that I’d work on that. So I  was very involved in that process and we ended	5487.78	5.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	up planning four free meetups and we talked  about our plans for the Berkshire weekend.	5493.24	4.717
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:07:56] Clay Finck: We talked about it  on the show back in October 2022. And then	5497.957	4.883
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	just within just a couple months, I quickly  realized that way more people were registering	5502.84	7.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	for our events than we had space for. So we  kind of had a little dilemma on our hands.	5510.04	5.46
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	People were spending thousands of dollars  to travel from all over the world.	5533.2	4.957
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:08:18] Clay Finck: And it wasn’t just a  see Warren and Charlie, they wanted to meet	5538.157	4.403
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	like-minded investors. And after going to  Omaha, I realized that this was absolutely	5542.56	6.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the case. And people would tell me that,  they were the one person in their circle,	5549.52	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	or the one person in their friend  group that was interested in investing.	5554.62	3.157
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:08:35] Clay Finck: So they really had no  one to talk about investing with. And I can	5557.777	3.803
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	totally resonate with that. I think back to  when I was a TIP listener. The vast majority	5561.58	5.82
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of my friends were not, and they weren’t  interested in investing really. So I kind	5567.4	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of had these conversations with myself  in my head, and then listening to you	5571.84	3.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and Preston on the show, almost having  that internal dialogue with you guys.	5575.8	3.637
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:08:56] Clay Finck: So I had mentioned  to you, Stig that I would absolutely love	5579.437	4.343
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to start a community for the TIP audience.  Specifically, what’s I wanted to be included in,	5583.78	6.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	it was, it’s a place where people could meet,  like minded investors. They had a network to	5590.14	5.64
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	bounce ideas off each other, a place where they  could get new ideas from others in that network.	5595.78	5.137
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:09:17] Clay Finck: They can run their  stock ideas in there and get people’s	5600.917	3.743
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	thought and feedback on stocks. And then just  somewhere they can ask questions to people,	5604.66	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	maybe explore new subjects. They  could ask you or me a question,	5610.72	3.3
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Stig. And then we also came up with the idea. Of  having a live meetup in New York City as well.	5614.02	7.057
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:09:37] Clay Finck: And I think people  were pretty excited about that. And we plan	5621.077	3.743
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	on doing that this fall. And so far, it just  seems to be getting a lot of interest. And	5624.82	5.1
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	one thing we’re also doing in the Mastermind  community is having weekly or maybe biweekly	5630.52	6.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	live events on Zoom for the community so people  can join live, they can hop in with questions,	5636.88	4.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and then we also record those  for people to watch afterwards.	5641.38	3.997
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:10:00] Clay Finck: So, another thing  I wanted with this community is for it to	5645.377	3.863
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	be relatively small and tight knit.  I just really wanted people to have	5649.24	8.4
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	a place where they could build these strong  and genuine connections with others. So, so	5657.64	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	we limited the TIP Mastermind Community  to 30 members for the general audience.	5661.84	4.297
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:10:17] Clay Finck: And then going into  Berkshire weekend, we had around 27 paid members,	5666.137	4.163
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and then to my surprise, around 15 of them were  going to Omaha. So I wasn’t planning this at all,	5670.3	5.94
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and I’ve already met around half the community.  So you know, many of the members are just truly	5676.24	6.84
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	incredible people. They’re engaging, they’re  joining our live calls, they’re going to Omaha.	5683.08	4.237
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:10:37] Clay Finck: And I honestly  just have a ton of fun learning from them,	5687.317	3.263
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	hearing their stories, and learning more  about their own investing strategies because,	5690.58	4.14
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that’s another interesting thing  is everyone kind of has their own	5694.72	3.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	viewpoint and their own strategy. So I  had mentioned on the Berkshire episode	5697.72	4.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	we’ve recently released that I feel like  we have the best audience in the world.	5702.4	4.657
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:10:56] Clay Finck: It’s likely that all  podcasts say that, or maybe they’re obligated	5707.057	3.983
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to say that. But I truly do believe that  our audience members are absolutely amazing,	5711.04	5.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	especially judging all the people we I met at our  meetups and met from the mastermind community. And	5716.08	6.36
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	also, before I close out my answer here,  I also wanted to mention that the price	5722.44	5.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	tag to join the community is north of $100  per month, which I’m well aware is not low.	5727.72	6.157
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:11:22] Clay Finck: But really, I just  want to ensure that we keep the community	5733.877	3.383
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	relatively small and we can continue to attract  to those high quality people. At the time of	5737.26	5.88
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	this recording, we have around 36 members.  I had mentioned we wanted to cap it at 30,	5743.14	3.78
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but I wanted to give everyone  in Omaha the chance to get in	5746.92	3.24
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	as well and join as they’re kind of  our TIP super fans I would call them.	5750.16	4.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:11:43] Stig Brodersen: And I guess, one thing  that you hit on there was that not knowing anyone	5756.28	7.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	in your circle that could talk about stock  investing, and I didn’t really know anyone	5763.36	7.08
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	before I met Preston in 2013 and so, and don’t get  me wrong, people don’t love talking about stocks.	5771.04	5.913
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:11:58] Stig Brodersen: They just don’t  get me wrong. I mean, they just don’t know	5776.953	3.507
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	what they’re talking about. And so like they  would say, oh, buy this stock. And you ask why?	5780.46	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Well, it’s awesome. Or you’ll get all  kind of weird responses. They would never	5785.56	4.56
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	dream about opening, reading the financial  statements. That’s not how I think about it.	5790.12	4.713
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:12:14] Stig Brodersen: It’s just like, oh, the  price doubles. So I was probably going to double	5794.833	2.307
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	again. And so I had friends to talk to about  investing. I just didn’t have anyone who were,	5797.14	6.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	who I felt I was in the, on the same journey with.  And if you told them you were going to Omaha,	5803.26	5.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	spend thousands of dollars and  fly 20 hours to go there to like,	5808.42	3.12
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	listen to Warren Buffett, they  would be like, who’s Warren Buffett?	5811.54	2.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:12:31] Stig Brodersen: So it was just  fantastic first to meet Preston and then	5813.58	5.16
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to meet other like-minded investors. And that’s  what we want to facilitate. But you know,	5819.82	17.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	even whenever I speak with Tobi and Hari, we  also talk sometimes whenever we don’t record it,	5837.04	6.6
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	but whenever we do record it, you  are also constrained to some extent.	5843.64	4.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:12:48] Stig Brodersen: Partly, we have  time zones whenever kids back and forth and	5848.44	6.54
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	all of that. And, and it has to fit into  the podcast format of we started building	5854.98	5.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	this. What I like about the mastermind community  where you’ve been gracious enough to invite me,	5860.2	5.34
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Clay, I should say is that we can have as  many discussions about a stock as we want.	5865.54	4.2
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:13:04] Stig Brodersen: We can share our  screens, we can compute together, you can sort	5869.74	3.18
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of do different things. You can’t really do on  the investors podcast format. It’s just not how	5872.92	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	we do things for a number of different reasons.  So I really like that we can dig deeper and you	5878.92	4.74
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	can meet people from all around the world  who are really on the same journey as you.	5883.66	4.964
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:13:19] Stig Brodersen: So if  anyone finds this interesting,	5888.624	2.536
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	I’ll highly encourage everyone to check it out.  And I wanted to throw it over to you, Clay.	5891.16	4.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	How can the audience join the community?	5896.98	2.94
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:13:30] Clay Finck: Yeah. Before I answer  that, I do want to pull the string on that	5899.92	4.86
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	idea of people from all over the world. I’ve  had one-on-one conversations with each member,	5904.78	4.8
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	and we have people from Australia and  people from different areas of Europe.	5909.58	5.017
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:13:43] Clay Finck: We have people from  California, New York, and many people from	5914.597	3.503
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Canada too. I mean, this is people from  all over the world and it’s just so many	5918.1	4.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	different interesting and new backgrounds  and new perspectives, and. That’s just one	5923.32	6.3
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	of the truly incredible things about our TIP  audience Stig, is just how global it really is.	5929.62	5.017
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:14:02] Clay Finck: It’s just a  crazy to think how, I’m just a guy from	5934.637	4.163
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	Nebraska in the middle of nowhere in Nebraska,  in the US and, we’re connecting with people	5939.52	6.0
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	from Australia and all over the world.  Just an incredible thought but anyways,	5945.52	5.04
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	as of today I mentioned that our community  is currently closed to new members.	5950.56	4.777
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:14:20] Clay Finck: And for the time being,  I’d like to spend quite a bit of time focusing	5955.337	3.803
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	on our first cohort and adding as much value  as I can to them. And then assuming all goes	5959.14	5.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	well for the next few months, and I feel that we  have the capacity to add new members, I’d like	5964.9	5.22
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to add around 15 to 20 more sometime during  the summer, and that’s assuming that there’s	5970.12	5.94
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	still interest from new members to join, which I  suspect there will be given the interest to date.	5976.06	4.32
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:14:45] Clay Finck: And I’d like to give  those, listening to this episode today,	5980.38	3.9
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	the chance to attend our live in-person meetup  in New York City. We’re still working out a	5984.28	5.58
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	lot of the details there on what that’s  going to entail, but sometime this fall	5989.86	3.66
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	we plan on doing a weekend trip to New York  City. If you have any questions about that,	5993.52	3.96
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	you can feel free to shoot me an  email, clay@theinvestorspodcast.com.	5997.48	1.489
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:15:05] Clay Finck: And then because of  the limited availability, we decided that	5998.969	6.791
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	we’re likely going to have people apply to  join. We want to ensure that we can keep the	6005.76	6.3
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	group really high quality and we’re letting  in high quality people that are excited to	6012.06	4.68
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	engage with others and learn from others. So it’s  likely we’re going to have people apply as well.	6016.74	5.437
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:15:26] Clay Finck: So it’s just something  to be mindful of. And I also wanted to mention	6022.177	4.283
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	that we do offer a 30 day money back guarantee.  So if for any reason you decide the community	6026.46	5.76
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	isn’t a good or a right fit for you, then  you’ll be a hundred percent refunded,	6032.22	4.5
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	no questions asked. Absolutely. I’ll send it  right away. So if you’d like to stay updated	6036.72	6.06
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	on when we open the community back up to  new members, you can join our wait list by	6042.78	4.44
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	visiting theinvestorspodcast.com/mastermind.  That is theinvestorspodcast.com/mastermind	6047.22	8.28
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	to join the wait list and stay updated  on when the community opens back up.	6055.5	4.4
DhN8uBjrrgU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN8uBjrrgU	[01:16:01] Stig Brodersen: Thank you Clay,  for jumping on the call and with that said,	6059.9	5.08

Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:01:28] Trey Lockerbie: Welcome to The  Investor’s Podcast. I’m your host, Trey	26.855	3.145
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Lockerbie. As I said at the top, I’m here with  Eddy Elfenbein. Eddy, welcome back to the show.	30.0	4.353
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:01:39] Eddy Elfenbein: Thanks for having me.	34.353	1.227
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:01:41] Trey Lockerbie: I have been looking  forward to this conversation because you do	35.58	4.5
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	something very fascinating: you publish something  called The Buy List, which is now an ETF. We’ll	40.08	7.2
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	talk about it, but also, you only touch this fund  once a year, so there is so much to discuss. I	47.28	9.18
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	want to first dive into the performance and then  talk about the updates to the fund for 2023, etc.	56.46	5.673
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:02:08] Trey Lockerbie: So, I’m going to  go ahead and brag a little bit for you. The	62.133	3.807
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	2022 fund performance came out to a negative  10.42%, but -9.28% adjusted for dividends,	65.94	8.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	which is versus the benchmark of the S&P 500 at  -18.11%. This is an outperformance of nearly 9%.	74.04	8.4
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I mean, that’s not to be understated in the year  we just had. So, can you talk about what it was	82.44	11.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	like to live through it, knowing you had to wait  until the end of the year to make any changes?	94.32	5.373
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:02:42] Eddy Elfenbein: It was a difficult  year, and sometimes you want to take the hammer	99.693	3.987
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and bust the case in and grab it and make  changes. But I always feel that sticking	103.68	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	with the rules is better in the long term  because you don’t panic. Keeping with these	108.96	8.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	strict rules forces you to stick to your game  plan and stay with the stocks that you like.	117.06	6.933
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:03:08] Eddy Elfenbein: And it was an  interesting year because I believe it was the	123.993	4.227
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	fourth worst calendar year of the past 80 years.  Some of that is the calendar effect because the	128.22	7.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	peak day was the very first trading day of the  year, and then we were tempted with multiple bear	135.78	7.38
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	market rallies. So, a lot of times, people going  by their gut instinct would have been fooled. They	143.16	6.42
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	would’ve thought, okay, this has passed us by and  we’re going to go right back. Nope, then the bears	149.58	5.04
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	came right in and pushed us lower, and it happened  again and again. I think the low didn’t happen	154.62	4.8
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	until mid-October, so nearly the entire year the  bias was always to the downside. It was a really	161.82	8.16
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	difficult year for the stock market and the bond  market as well. The 60/40 portfolio, legendary	169.98	7.44
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	strategy, had one of its worst years on record  as well. It seems like there were no safe places.	177.42	5.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:04:11] Trey Lockerbie:	183.3	1.68
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Now, your ETF, the ticker is CWS, and you  launched it in 2016. It’s had an amazing run,	184.98	7.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	but it ended up flat for the year. I have to  assume that’s only a good thing, considering the	192.54	6.42
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	market we had. Can you talk to us about how you  saw the ETF performing versus the fund list on it?	198.96	7.064
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:04:34] Eddy Elfenbein: We have to be very  careful in our language. In saying that the	206.024	5.956
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	ETF is based on the Buy List, it’s not always  going to be exactly 100% the same. For example,	211.98	7.08
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	an ETF just has to hold a small position in  cash, like 0.3 or 0.4%. We have to do that,	219.06	9.18
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	whereas when I do the Buy List calculations that’s  not figured in at all. It’s always difficult.	228.24	7.92
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:05:03] Eddy Elfenbein: On a year like  that, we sucked less than everybody else. And,	236.16	5.94
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	as odd as that sounds, that actually is very  important in long-term performance. In many	242.1	7.2
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	ways, in a strongly bullish year, we’re  probably not going to be up as much. But,	249.3	5.7
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it’s not symmetrical, so we’ll do  much better in difficult years.	255.66	4.713
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:05:24] Eddy Elfenbein: And not as  well better in those strong years and	260.373	5.487
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	string together many years of that. It results in  long-term outperformance. So, it is odd saying,	265.86	6.96
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	you know, the ETF was flat or, you know, we  didn’t get those returns. That’s actually good	272.82	4.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	news considering the environment. Also, when we,  at the end of each year, we rebalance all of the	277.38	8.76
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	positions. So many aspects. We’re getting  good prices, once we do that rebalancing.	286.14	5.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:05:54] Trey Lockerbie: A couple of thoughts  on that. What’s so fascinating about it being	292.02	4.68
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	flat is that it’s all equities, right? Also,  it’s not like some sort of ETF that’s hedged	296.7	4.98
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	with a bunch of different asset classes. It’s  all equities, which I find really interesting.	301.68	3.813
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:06:12] Trey Lockerbie: Now, I know your  rule of thumb is, I don’t know if this is a	305.493	4.047
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	hard and fast rule, remind me, but I know you  swap about five stocks every year. This year,	309.54	5.58
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	were you tempted to change more than five?  Because I know there were some dogs in there.	315.12	5.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:06:32] Eddy Elfenbein: Actually, believe  it or not, I was tempted to do less than five.	320.22	4.773
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:06:36] Eddy Elfenbein: Sometimes it  gets harder and we’ve always said, you know,	324.993	4.287
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	five stocks each year. My business partner says,  there’s no reason you can do four or three. And	329.28	6.06
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	that’s true, but we’ve never done that. Sometimes  I do have difficulty selecting which one I want to	335.34	6.78
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	get rid of. You naturally become attached  to them and you have to fight that urge.	342.12	7.053
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:07:00] Eddy Elfenbein: You need to be  as rational and business-like as possible.	349.173	4.287
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	But for example, one of the stocks, Church  and Dwight, I like a lot about it. There’s	353.46	5.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	a lot of things I like about this company and  ultimately I made the decision to drop it. This	359.34	6.9
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	year they just had a number of issues crop up  during the year as far as managing expenses	366.24	5.34
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and dealing with supply problems and inflation.  I think it hurts them more than they realize,	371.58	6.3
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	or I realize. And so I had to let that go.  Oh, not Church and Dwight, I like that stock	377.88	6.3
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	so much. But also we have more than once we’ve  had companies that we’ve caught and rejoined	384.18	6.0
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	us. And that even happened this year with a cool  company, Middleby, which did very well for us.	390.18	5.913
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:07:54] Eddy Elfenbein: We didn’t have  it in 2022. I’m not a good market timer,	396.093	5.307
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	but boy we got that right because the stock got	401.4	2.52
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	flattened last year and then I looked  into it and we just had it right back.	403.92	4.773
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:08:10] Eddy Elfenbein: And so, you know,  that can happen a lot of times. Maybe that will	408.693	3.567
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	happen with Church and Dwight down the line.  So it’s always nice. Another one that did very	412.26	5.4
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	well for us this year was I know it’s called  FCO. It used to be called Fair Isaac. I think	417.66	6.06
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	legally it’s Fair Isaac, but I think they’re  trying to push the FCO and mean even when it’s	423.72	5.04
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	entered the lexicon, when FCO scores any, and  the American knows what you’re talking about.	428.76	3.933
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:08:43] Eddy Elfenbein: And  they had a great year for us. One,	432.693	3.567
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	one of our top performers, even  jumped 30% in one. And they were on,	436.26	6.06
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and I got rid of them years ago. I probably  shouldn’t have done that to atone for my sins.	442.32	6.36
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:08:59] Trey Lockerbie: Well, it’s funny how  you know that human bias is always going to be	448.68	4.74
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	a part of the equation, unless you’re a total  quant, right? But at least you’re mitigating	453.42	4.68
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it with these once a year changes. I imagine that  has a huge impact. So a couple of points on what	458.1	5.52
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	you just said there, the Church and Dwight one,  and in our last conversation, we talked about a	463.62	4.5
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	little bit. You were explaining it as sort of the  baking soda and condoms company, right. Where, so	468.12	5.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	you’d never have a hesitation buying something  like that, because if you think about it, like,	474.0	3.78
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	you know, a Buffet style stock where  it’s boring or just at least like,	477.78	3.6
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	everyone’s going to always need these products.  I found that to be surprising that it went away.	481.38	4.533
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:09:53] Trey Lockerbie: So, is the sentiment  on that more around management as far as what	485.913	4.707
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	you were saying there? Is it not so much the  conglomerate itself as far as the products go,	490.62	5.82
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	but more about how they’re  managing the company itself?	496.44	2.7
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:10:09] Eddy Elfenbein: I mean, it’s  both. I would say that, you know, in the	499.14	3.72
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	sense it was, management was blindsided by the  macro environment, particularly sales. You know,	502.86	8.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the cost passing on the cost of goods in a  sector that’s very competitive, as far as cost.	511.14	6.573
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:10:27] Eddy Elfenbein: And they had  a difficulty doing that, trying to look	517.713	3.567
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	through. They said their organic would be  negative. I’m trying to recall what they had,	521.28	9.06
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	they said earnings growth would be something like  4 to 8% that got cut and then they said it would	530.34	5.76
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	be flat. That happened all throughout the year  and so that sort of led me to. But instinctively,	536.1	6.42
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I tend to like it if it gets into a  little trouble. But ultimately I thought,	542.52	5.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and also I wasn’t really wild about the recent  growth numbers. Very similar story with Reynolds	548.4	8.52
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Consumer Products, facing many of the same issues,  and got rid of it for many of the same reasons.	556.92	7.68
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:11:13] Trey Lockerbie: So  you mentioned Middleby as well.	564.6	3.0
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	You’ve brought it back. As you’ve  mentioned, you let go of it in 2020,	567.6	4.08
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I believe. Talk to us about why  or what it’s done to win you back.	571.68	4.953
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:11:24] Eddy Elfenbein: Well, I mean,  I have to talk about this, this was one	576.633	3.267
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	of the most incredible. Rollercoaster rides we  have because, so they make sort of industrial	579.9	6.84
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	kitchen supplies, big ovens and, you  know, conveyor belt kind of things.	586.74	5.433
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:11:39] Eddy Elfenbein: And when  the lockdowns came in March of 2020,	592.173	5.187
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the stock got absolutely collaborative. You  see, you know, hotels in businesses, this is	597.36	5.76
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	what is going to impact them. The stock fell,  I’m trying to think. It was around one in 20.	603.12	5.76
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	And it fell to 40 within days. I mean, it was  so fast and so hard. And then the company put	608.88	9.06
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	on one of the most spectacular rallies and it got  to 200 by the end of the year, right around there.	617.94	8.024
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:12:12] Eddy Elfenbein: I may be off some, but  it vaulted from its March. And that’s when I said,	625.964	6.316
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	okay, this is too much. Let’s take some profits  off the table on this. Then so this year it	632.28	6.96
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	fell again, it fell back to about, from 200  to about one 20, and I was looking at the	639.24	5.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	earnings reports and the last one the bottom  line missed, but the numbers were quite good.	644.34	7.293
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:12:38] Eddy Elfenbein: I think the EBITDA  growth was 23. It’s odd what numbers you can	651.633	6.087
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	remember. I think that’s what they did. So  they were still showing impressive numbers	657.72	5.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and I’m trying to think it was around $10  per share is what we’re looking for earnings,	662.82	7.26
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	give or take, and it’s around one 40.  That’s not bad for this environment.	670.08	4.773
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:13:00] Eddy Elfenbein: And also I just like  the long term growth of their operating income.	674.853	6.567
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	It’s a nice grower, it’s a good business to  be in. So I saw that the numbers continued to	681.42	6.18
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	look good this year and the price went down,  and so I figured, Hey, this is a good time	687.6	6.12
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	to get back in. Maybe, we’ll, we could have  the same magic with it, but really like this.	693.72	4.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:13:24] Trey Lockerbie: Now, I think I do know  the answer to this, but I wanted to make sure,	698.28	4.98
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	did any of the macro themes leading into  2022 help inform the list at all? You know,	703.86	6.6
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	knowing interest rates were likely  going up and you were seeing inflation,	710.46	4.26
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	et cetera, were you looking to build more  of a defense. Portfolio going into the year?	714.72	4.32
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:13:42] Eddy Elfenbein: Yeah the short answer  is no, but the longer answer is that even by not	719.7	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	doing that, it helped us very much. And I think  that was the key driver to our out-performance	724.98	5.22
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	last year. But I can’t take any credit for that  whatsoever. But the, this is how I would describe	730.2	6.78
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it and filler for a lot of listeners,  but when Covid came the market got very.	736.98	8.22
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:14:06] Eddy Elfenbein: and the government,  particularly the federal government and the	745.2	4.74
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Federal Reserve, responded massively.  In many ways, I think they were trying	749.94	6.06
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	to not do what had happened during the  financial crisis where the response was	756.0	6.36
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	somewhat slow. Only as they saw more and more  evidence did the response get more dramatic.	762.36	5.973
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:14:28] Eddy Elfenbein: This time, they  responded dramatically and very early. So you have	768.333	6.387
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	to understand that the stock market is a delicate  balance between return and risk and what the	774.72	8.4
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	federal. Did as it said, we’re going to take risks  off the table. Risk. We’re going to, basically,	783.12	7.26
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	if you prefer, we’re going to nationalize  risk. That completely worked the market.	790.38	7.653
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:14:55] Eddy Elfenbein: It’s like putting a  magnet near a compass because all of these areas	798.033	4.767
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	that are much riskier, they had a free ride,  they had a backstop. So all of these sectors,	802.8	7.08
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	places like, you know, Peloton and Zoom  and they just took off to the moon. We	811.5	5.46
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	saw these enormous rallies in this and also  in the crypto world, also in the NFT world.	816.96	7.893
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:15:20] Eddy Elfenbein: Just all those  high risk areas. Meanwhile, the boring areas,	824.853	5.727
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the value areas, the low low volatility.  We’re really left behind. What it ha, so	830.58	5.04
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the story of 2022 was, We completely  unspool that and all the high risk areas	835.62	6.9
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I thought Facebook meta platforms, it fell  by what, 60, 70% Tesla was down all of that.	842.52	8.546
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:15:47] Eddy Elfenbein: I mean  the stars of the lockdowns really,	851.066	4.534
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	they felt significant. And then a lot of the  value, I wouldn’t call the ETF a value one,	856.32	7.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	but it was value, high quality. And those did  well. So it was the resurgence and that was	863.88	7.44
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	when interest rates were at zero. Who cares  about a PE ratio? I mean, it doesn’t matter.	872.28	4.953
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:16:12] Eddy Elfenbein: But suddenly when  rates are at upper three or 4%, then suddenly	877.233	4.947
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	people worry about things like valuation. So  in many ways, 2022 was the waking up to that,	882.18	6.84
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	that the valuations came back and some  sanity was restored to the market. I	889.02	5.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	didn’t predict any of that , but I certainly  rode the events all throughout last year.	894.9	6.24
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:16:38] Trey Lockerbie: That’s that sort of  rotation, right? You hear about every, so now	901.14	4.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and then from, you know, momentum, into value,  into growth, et cetera. In our last discussion,	905.7	5.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	you said that every year the biggest winner  is always one that surprises you. So I’d like	910.8	6.12
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	to go over the top five winners and highlight  perhaps some ideas as to why they did so well.	916.92	5.193
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:16:58] Trey Lockerbie: But before doing so,	922.113	1.287
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I’m curious to know which  stock surprised you the most?	923.4	2.82
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:17:03] Eddy Elfenbein: Oh boy, maybe Aflac.  It’s just, you know, it’s such a steady business.	926.22	10.8
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	They do what they do so well. And I’ve had do you  have the numbers in front of you? I don’t know. I	937.02	6.033
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:17:14] Trey Lockerbie: do, yeah, 23.21%. Wow.	943.053	3.3
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:17:17] Eddy Elfenbein: And so, and, but it was  40 points better than the S&P 500 and you know,	946.353	5.667
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it’s supplemental insurance, it’s nothing really.	952.02	3.633
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:17:26] Eddy Elfenbein: But also I think  that, going back to the previous point,	955.653	2.787
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it shows you the. You know it did a lot better,  it had a better year than Mark Zuckerberg .	958.44	6.364
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:17:36] Trey Lockerbie:	964.804	1.676
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I mean, yeah. And to be quite honest, that one  in particular is still looking undervalued to me,	966.48	6.42
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	which I’m going to, I’m going to cover a few  of my three that I see in the new list that	972.9	5.16
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I’m still very optimistic about, but they’ll  just spoiler that one, even though it went up.	978.06	4.86
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:17:49] Trey Lockerbie: 20 odd percent in  22 still seems very undervalued. And last time	982.92	5.34
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	we did touch on this one in the last episode a  year ago, and you mention. 70% of the revenue	988.26	5.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	comes from Japan. Yeah. Which I still find  to be kind of a fascinating fact. Do you see	993.36	4.98
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	that shifting? Are they going more global?  Is there growth coming from elsewhere now,	998.34	4.2
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	or is it all kind of still a lot of  it coming from that part of the world?	1002.54	3.84
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:18:13] Eddy Elfenbein: Well, they have a  monopoly in Japan, so that’s always going to	1006.38	5.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	be a large part of their business. But they do  a significant business. Any growing business	1011.48	3.84
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	in the United States, I don’t know how well  that’s going to be balanced in the long term.	1015.32	5.553
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:18:27] Eddy Elfenbein: But, you know,  when you look at the business and they’re,	1020.873	2.907
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	you know, known for the famous ads with the Aflac  Duck, America is pretty small in their universe,	1023.78	7.14
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I think. I think Japan will continue to. A major  source of the dominant source of their business.	1030.92	6.78
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:18:42] Trey Lockerbie: So some of  the other big winners you mentioned,	1037.7	2.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Fico, that was up a little  over 38%, which is incredible.	1040.58	4.473
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:18:49] Trey Lockerbie: HSY, which is Hershey,  19.69%. And then we had scientific applications,	1045.053	9.327
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	s a i c 32.71%. We discussed this last time, so  if you want to go back to our last episode we	1055.64	7.2
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	kind of touched on this one in depth. Your  shorthand for it was that it’s the Penta.	1062.84	2.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Think about it like the Pentagon’s It  help desk, which I’ve always liked.	1065.72	3.42
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:19:11] Trey Lockerbie: You have  this gift for coming up with these	1069.74	2.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	really sticky branding ideas  for these stocks, which I love.	1072.02	3.444
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:19:16] Eddy Elfenbein: Similar. Can  I say something about Hershey? And this	1075.464	5.976
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	is a good lesson for investors. People  listening out there say that so often	1081.44	5.16
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the best year to own a stock, you really  don’t see your gains until the third year.	1087.32	5.733
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:19:30] Eddy Elfenbein: And with her,  she was really our fourth year. So we had	1093.053	3.987
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it on The Buy List for three years and it  should have done well, nothing great. But	1097.04	6.18
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	then it outperforms by what, 50% this year.  It really turned into a rockstar this year,	1103.22	5.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and it’s on The Buy List for the  fifth year. So that is, you know,	1109.1	3.48
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	people want to see immediate gains when  you do a lot of focused stock picking.	1112.58	6.093
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:19:56] Eddy Elfenbein: It takes a while.  Before you really see that huge pay. And you	1118.673	7.407
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	know, a lot of times they say the best  stock to own is one you already know.	1126.08	4.32
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Another thing with Hershey is that the  company said this was not hidden anywhere.	1131.0	5.34
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	The company said we are having productivity  problems. We cannot keep up with demand.	1136.34	6.033
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:20:19] Eddy Elfenbein: And there  are multiple articles about this. It’s	1142.373	2.847
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	sort of like they were advertising. Anyone  who just bothered to pay attention would	1145.22	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	see that the company was doing very well  and their problem that they were dealing	1150.5	4.14
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	with. Was managing growth and they have since  increased capacity to keep up with business.	1154.64	5.853
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:20:37] Eddy Elfenbein: It’s so odd that this  is a name everybody knows. You know, as I said,	1160.493	4.707
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	there’s no city in America called, you know,  low fat Pennsylvania, but there is for Hershey,	1165.2	7.32
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	for chocolate. There absolutely is. And they  were basically telling us right to our faces,	1172.52	4.86
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it was a bargain hidden in plain. So I  just wanted to add that bit about Hershey.	1177.38	5.789
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:20:59] Trey Lockerbie: Oh, I’m glad he  did. I mean I did, I touched on it with David	1183.169	2.911
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Gardner recently The Motley Fool because I was  challenging non sort of tech oriented stocks,	1186.08	6.72
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	for lack of a better way to say it. And I  mentioned that it had reached its 52 week high,	1192.8	4.02
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and that was fairly recently, you know, in  a year where the S&P 500 did what it did.	1196.82	4.353
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:21:16] Trey Lockerbie: I mean,  the markets just in general did what	1201.173	1.647
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	they did. The year hit 52, a week  high. Like that’s pretty remarkable.	1202.82	3.36
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:21:22] Eddy Elfenbein: I like their  business model. They make chocolate and	1206.18	4.2
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	then they sell it for more than they make  it, and then they repeat that , and there’s	1210.38	5.34
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	nothing high tech about it whatsoever,  but it’s a very profitable business.	1215.72	3.96
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:21:36] Trey Lockerbie: Now, another big  winner was Silgan, if I’m saying that correctly,	1219.68	4.98
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Silgan Holdings, which was up 21.01%,  and. This is one we highlighted in our	1225.68	7.14
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	last discussion because it was standing  out to be another one that seemed pretty	1232.82	2.82
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	undervalued. This one, just to recap, is sort  of the metal container stock, if you will.	1235.64	6.153
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:21:55] Trey Lockerbie: You mentioned it’s very  boring . It’s very overlooked or overlooked. And	1241.793	4.347
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	talk about maybe the validation you saw  with that stock going into the year?	1248.42	3.573
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:22:04] Eddy Elfenbein: This, I have  to say, is one of my favorite stocks,	1251.993	3.567
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and I have a soft spot for it.  And it’s a very boring company,	1255.56	4.8
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	but I think of it this way, whatever their  market cap is, I don’t know, 5 billion or so.	1260.36	5.493
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:22:17] Eddy Elfenbein: If someone said, here’s  a check for $4 billion and recreate, go off and do	1265.853	9.267
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	what Silgan. I don’t think you’d be able  to do it. I think you’d need a lot more	1275.72	4.8
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	money to be able to do this. They have  production facilities all over the place,	1280.52	5.46
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	so it’s very close to whatever you  want to do. It’s not just metal.	1285.98	3.993
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:22:39] Eddy Elfenbein: They do all sorts  of containers. No matter any business needs	1289.973	4.167
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	a container, needs something to ship it in, and  they’re the kind of company that if you’re going	1294.14	6.78
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	to be in business, may that involve containers.  It’s hard to avoid. I mean if you wanted to, if	1300.92	11.58
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	you said purposely we’re going to avoid them, that  would be very evident in your business decisions.	1312.5	6.6
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:23:05] Eddy Elfenbein: They’re just a part  of the industry that you need to deal with. They	1319.1	5.7
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	service their sector and they do a really good job  of what they do. So it’s a cool little company.	1324.8	5.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:23:17] Trey Lockerbie: Now, I’m jumping to an  assumption here, but given all the supply chain	1330.68	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	issues we had, and it seemed metal containers  were part of the equation just being really	1335.96	4.32
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	high in demand and very low in supply, did we  see a big price increase happen for Silgan?	1340.28	5.733
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:23:30] Trey Lockerbie: Did they,  were they able to capitalize on that?	1346.013	2.187
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Do you think that was part of the  market performance? Maybe talk a	1348.2	2.52
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	little bit about the revenue growth  or something that was driving.	1350.72	2.82
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:23:38] Eddy Elfenbein: Yeah I think  it was a good example of revenue growth	1353.54	5.4
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	does not always equal volume growth.  So I think they did a good job of	1358.94	4.86
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	balancing the higher prices and you know,  and getting to their customers as well.	1363.8	4.953
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:23:52] Eddy Elfenbein: So that was  a a key issue last year for that. But	1368.753	3.807
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I was impressed by the way the company perform.	1372.56	4.02
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:24:01] Trey Lockerbie: All right. Well,  let’s talk about some of the bigger losers	1376.58	3.84
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	here. I’m just going to go over a couple of  them. You mentioned Reynolds, but that one,	1380.42	3.72
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	although it was facing headwinds, like  you said, it wasn’t down that big.	1384.14	3.693
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:24:11] Trey Lockerbie: It  was only down negative 4.52%,	1387.833	2.307
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	but you still nixed it for 2023. ,  whereas Trex, TREX, ticker, and just to	1390.14	5.49
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	refresh my memory, that’s Yeah. Just Trex  company. Right? So Trex, ticker, TREX was	1395.63	1.05
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	down negative 68%, but has stayed in the mix  for 2023, so, I’m kind of curious to know more	1396.68	6.72
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	about what drove these decisions. You know,  it’s obviously not all performance related.	1403.4	3.693
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:24:36] Eddy Elfenbein: Right. So one of  the things when you look at the company you	1407.093	4.047
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	want today, are the problems internal or are the  problems external? If the problems are external,	1411.14	7.62
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	look, a good example is Aflac.  They always have to deal with the	1418.76	3.54
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	yen dollar exchange rate. But the thing  about that factor is it comes and goes.	1422.3	4.593
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:24:54] Eddy Elfenbein: So if it works  against you in one quarter, it may work	1426.893	3.687
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	against you in the. But if there’s a problem  with the business, something endemic to them,	1430.58	7.02
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	that’s a much bigger issue. So with  Trex, they make the fake wooden decks,	1437.6	7.5
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	they were blindsided by the housing  industry or knocked down due to the	1445.1	5.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	weakness in the housing sector, it’s not  really due to their failings as a business.	1450.98	7.233
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:25:25] Eddy Elfenbein: Once the  housing sector Revives and gets better.	1458.213	4.647
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I have every reason to believe that Trex will  get better. There’s nothing implicit within	1463.46	5.94
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the business that is a problem for Trex. So  that’s the key. And whereas we were talking	1469.4	9.24
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	about was a Reynolds, the ones that I thought  there was, you know, greater problems in the	1478.64	8.4
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	performance of, in the execution of their  business, that had me more concerned.	1488.54	5.16
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:25:56] Trey Lockerbie: So going into  2022 Reynolds, you were looking at it,	1493.7	4.92
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I believe we talked about it a little bit  last time as a turnaround opportunity. Their	1498.62	3.96
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	free cash flow had recently taken this huge  dive and it dropped off the list in 23. But	1502.58	6.72
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I’m just kind of curious, was that. Not  the case, just not seeing the turnaround	1509.3	4.02
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	opportunity or it just didn’t prove out  in the timeframe you were looking for?	1513.32	2.553
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:26:17] Eddy Elfenbein: Yeah I would say  so. They said that e p s for this year would be	1515.873	6.747
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	a buck 56 to a buck 70, something around  that. And then that was lowered once	1523.34	5.58
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and then it was lowered again to around a  dollar 30 per share. So, we’ll, you know,	1528.92	6.06
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the Q4 numbers will be out later this month or  maybe early February. So it was that continuation,	1534.98	5.46
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	not one but two downgrades that really had  me concerned about what was going on, and	1540.44	6.78
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I didn’t feel that it was turning  around the way my thesis was.	1549.02	5.373
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:26:51] Eddy Elfenbein: And that’s really a  key to selling in stock when it’s no longer the	1554.393	5.787
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	company that your original thesis is. And I had  to come to the realization that my reasons for	1560.18	6.9
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	buying the stock were not panning out  even though the loss wasn’t that bad.	1567.08	6.213
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:27:10] Trey Lockerbie: Let’s dig  in a little bit more on the 2023 buy	1573.293	2.967
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	list. So you newly added Polaris and  there’s a repeat company there, step in,	1576.26	5.34
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and both of their free cash flows seem to have  fallen off a cliff fairly recently as well.	1581.6	5.373
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:27:23] Trey Lockerbie: You know, Polaris was	1586.973	2.367
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	805 million in 2020 to negative 39  million in the trailing 12 months.	1589.34	6.24
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:27:31] Eddy Elfenbein: The number  for 2020 was very high. And in fact,	1595.58	6.9
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I believe it had really been creeping up  in the late teens. So the 2020 2020 number	1603.2	4.8
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	was significantly high compared  to all their previous trends.	1608.9	4.953
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:27:46] Eddy Elfenbein: And you’re right,  it completely tanked in 2020. And I believe	1613.853	4.167
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	so a decent rebound last year as well. Now  also if you look at the operating income,	1618.02	7.14
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the adjusted operating income, that’s pretty  stable. And it has been and I think we’ll	1625.16	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	continue to be. So it sort of just wants to  add those other variables to what I look at.	1630.44	5.313
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:28:08] Eddy Elfenbein: The thing  about Polaris. By conventional metrics.	1635.753	3.927
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	It’s a cheap stock and there’s a strong  cyclical factor to the industry. I mean,	1639.68	7.02
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	snowmobileS&Play things. And obviously that’s  going to go better when the economy, you know,	1646.7	4.98
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	people are going to cut back on those sorts  of good examples of a consumer cyclical stock.	1651.68	6.273
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:28:30] Eddy Elfenbein: And that can be  difficult too. Under conventional metrics.	1657.953	8.367
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	And so you always want to adjust for where you  are in the economic cycle. So that’s just for	1666.32	7.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	people doing securities analysis. That can be  very tricky because you can get false negatives	1673.88	7.2
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	by just following regular PE or EBITDA or  enterprise value or something like that.	1681.08	8.253
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:28:59] Eddy Elfenbein: So I always want  to take a more expansive view. Polaris,	1689.333	5.007
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I’m probably not getting it at the best time  considering the fragility of the economy. But	1694.34	7.86
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	given its price, given its historic operating  income, I think there’s a very good chance in	1702.2	7.02
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	three years that it could turn into a decent  winner. So, you know, it is similar to Hershey.	1709.22	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:29:24] Trey Lockerbie: So in a way, are  you viewing these two stocks as maybe in a	1714.5	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	similar framework that Reynolds was,  where you’re looking at them as these	1719.78	2.94
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	turnaround opportunities? Or are they simply just  economic cycles that you’re waiting to pan out?	1722.72	4.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:29:36] Eddy Elfenbein: I would say with  Polaris as a turnaround element with step,	1727.28	5.64
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	not just that I see as a count I may have had  55 years consecutive of increasing earnings.	1732.92	7.293
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:29:49] Eddy Elfenbein: It’s also, it’s a  small company. I mean, maybe two and a half	1740.213	3.267
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	billion in market, but a lot of people don’t  even know about this company. It’s a wonderful,	1743.48	4.14
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	wonderfully run company and I think  it’s what I see as more than the long	1748.76	5.64
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	term growth. And even though, you know, I had  a difficult year, but I’m optimistic about it.	1754.4	6.0
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:30:09] Trey Lockerbie: So Miller ticker, MLR  had a pretty tough year. It was down over 20%,	1760.4	9.0
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	but you held onto it. And last time we spoke,  you mentioned you do have this soft spot for	1769.4	7.14
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	this stock . So how has that conviction  held up through 2020 twos performance?	1776.54	4.953
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:30:27] Eddy Elfenbein: Well, let me say that  if you have a well diversified portfolio, It’s	1781.493	5.307
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	always a good idea to have one off-road stock,  one that’s kind of different from everybody else.	1786.8	6.273
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:30:38] Eddy Elfenbein: And that’s Miller.  Miller is by far the smallest company,	1793.073	3.807
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	so step in is maybe two and a half billion.  That’s our second smallest. Miller is probably	1796.88	6.66
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	320 million. I mean, it’s one. The size of  our 29th largest company. That’s how small	1803.54	9.0
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it is. And then you compare it to a, so like  Thermo Fisher or Danaher Company like that.	1812.54	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:31:02] Eddy Elfenbein: It’s barely, it’s a  tiny drop. It’s a cool company and I really like	1817.82	5.22
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it. And my thesis is a longer term turnaround.  So they make towing and recovery equipment. No	1823.04	7.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	analysts file it, no Wall Street and I mean, there  are people who file it, but no major Wall Street	1830.6	5.64
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	firms. So when you say what earnings expectations  are, we just don’t know what happened with Miller.	1836.24	7.113
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:31:27] Eddy Elfenbein: Is that the business?  Very much hurt by the lockdown and the period	1843.353	6.567
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	following the lockdowns. But if you look at  the 2019 numbers, I think the earnings were	1849.92	8.52
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	3 43 per share recently. Really a few weeks  ago, the stock was going for $21 per share,	1858.44	6.96
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	so the PE ratio of a couple years.  Is what, six times earnings?	1866.0	6.093
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:31:55] Eddy Elfenbein: Seven times earnings,	1872.093	1.647
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	but it’s just getting up to its full potential.  Of where it had been, the revenue has already	1873.74	6.84
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	got there. The last earnings report was quite  good. I think revenue was up maybe 25% and net	1880.58	7.5
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	income was up 35%. So they’re recovering very  strongly. So I still see it in play, my thesis.	1888.08	8.433
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:32:20] Eddy Elfenbein: Is that it’s  a company that was wrecked and is doing	1896.513	3.507
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	well and a lot of people just don’t see it  yet. I wouldn’t be surprised that Miller is	1900.02	5.22
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	our top performer for this year, but  getting back to your larger point,	1905.24	3.66
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and that is a good example of a 20% loser as  you’re not bothered at all by it. In fact,	1908.9	7.2
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it is probably maybe in the last two or  three months, it’s up 30 odd percent.	1916.1	3.993
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:32:43] Eddy Elfenbein: It’s  actually been moving up steadily,	1920.093	2.487
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	but as long as I see that continuous increase, I’m  trying to think this year or so, we’ll get the Q4	1922.58	9.24
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	report. They’ll do earnings sales of around 900  million in 2019. Their earnings before interest	1931.82	10.62
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	before tax. Was about 50 million. And so now  the market cap is about 600 and 320 million.	1942.44	8.073
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:33:13] Eddy Elfenbein: It just seems  so obvious to hold this and wait for the	1950.513	5.787
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	market to come to its senses. I  think it’s a really neat company.	1956.3	2.94
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:33:22] Trey Lockerbie: Yeah, this one was  interesting to me because this would be sort of on	1959.24	4.68
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the higher end of what you would call a microcap  stock, and I know that you’re sector agnostic.	1963.92	4.533
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:33:30] Trey Lockerbie: I was kind of  curious though, raises the question around	1968.453	2.367
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	size agnostic, right? You’re not, it kind of  jumps all over from mid caps large caps, so now	1971.72	4.68
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	micro caps and I’m curious if that’s intentional  or if my second question is just how did these	1976.4	8.7
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	micro caps appear on your radar because you  gotta go fishing a little bit deeper for those.	1985.1	4.8
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:33:50] Eddy Elfenbein: It’s always  cool to get something that nobody else	1989.9	5.58
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	knows about. So I will go I’ll get an  unusual stock that if I think about,	1995.48	6.72
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	especially LA companies that nobody else  follows. And that’s a great way to find	2002.2	4.68
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	values. I saw Morningstar, which  by the way, just had our fifth.	2006.88	5.58
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:34:10] Eddy Elfenbein: From Morningstar,  congratulations. They call us. Thank you.	2012.46	3.84
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	They call us mid-cap growth, and I  remember when I first went, really,	2016.3	4.44
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	we are it means nothing to me. It’s just the  25 stocks. They put it in their computer and	2020.74	6.96
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	they said, , this is midcap growth, but in  no way, I don’t, doesn’t mean anything to me.	2027.7	6.453
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:34:30] Eddy Elfenbein: But I  like to get a couple, like I said,	2034.153	5.607
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	off-road companies. I don’t know if  I’d call Miller Small Cap or Microcap,	2039.76	4.62
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	something that nobody knows about. I think you  always want to know, it’s a simple game. You turn	2044.38	8.7
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	over rocks and look for diamonds. Whoever  turns over the most rocks wins the game.	2053.08	5.553
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:34:51] Eddy Elfenbein: And  that’s really what it’s about.	2058.633	1.167
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	So I’m willing to look in an unusual  non-traditional place if I think there’s	2059.8	7.08
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	a good bargain to be had. Not only that, but  I’ll write it with a 20% loss in one year.	2067.78	6.08
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:35:07] Trey Lockerbie: It’s pretty  remarkable. Now, there are a couple other	2073.86	4.3
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	stocks in the new list that to me, are really  standing out when I’m using our TIP finance tool,	2078.94	6.0
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I’m coming up with double digit forecasted yields,  and we already talked about Aflac, even though it	2084.94	6.0
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	was up in the mid twenties in the last year,  I’m still seeing it as a very undervalued.	2090.94	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:35:26] Trey Lockerbie: Science  applications we already talked about as well,	2096.22	2.76
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	SAIC. So they were up 35% in 2022. Still looks  undervalue to me. And then there’s Seise,	2098.98	7.08
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	ticker ce. This one really jumped out to me  and not only is it a new addition, but I,	2106.06	5.82
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	our investing tool, shows that Buffet and Tom  Gainer both hold small positions in the stock.	2111.88	4.833
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:35:45] Trey Lockerbie: So I  always perk up when I see those	2116.713	2.067
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	names attached to something and  it’s. up big just in the first	2118.78	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	10 days of this year. So give us a high  level overview of what Celanese does?.	2124.06	5.22
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:35:59] Eddy Elfenbein: They make  acidic acid and that is something that	2129.28	4.92
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	has a huge number of applications within  industry. It goes from paint to adhesives.	2134.2	6.633
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:36:09] Eddy Elfenbein: It’s a hugely  important part of the chemical industry.	2140.833	3.567
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	And they have a 25% market share. It’s a  very, I wouldn’t say dominant, but very	2144.4	5.76
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	strong position within the market. They also make  many other chemicals as well. Now, this has been	2150.16	7.5
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	an important year for them. Let me backup and  talk about DuPont, which is a company that has.	2157.66	6.993
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:36:33] Eddy Elfenbein: Struggled over the  last few years, and this has been in the news	2164.653	3.447
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	over the last five years, I think DuPont, is that  the market is up roughly 50%. DuPont is down 50%,	2168.94	7.32
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	so they are trying to change their direction. So  they sold one of their major units and CEL said,	2176.26	10.38
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Yeah, we’re interested. And they did a massive  deal for the DuPont unit and it cost 11 billion.	2187.24	8.25
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:37:02] Eddy Elfenbein: So if you see on the  balance sheet right now, you see a huge cash	2195.49	4.17
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	position, I think of nine and a half billion.  And this is a, this is not just an acquisition,	2199.66	6.06
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	but they’re merging with a company about their  same size. So it’s a huge deal that they’re	2205.72	8.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	doing. And the stock did not do well at all last  year, and I think some of that was a reaction.	2214.0	6.153
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:37:27] Eddy Elfenbein: As I look at the  numbers, I think it’s a good deal, but oh,	2220.153	4.287
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	let’s see. Warren Buffet is sitting on a big loss  right now in Celese, but I like it and I think	2224.44	6.42
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	this deal. Can be a game changer. It again, it  will, I think they said it’s going to be accretive	2230.86	5.76
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	to earning something like $4 per share this year  so that is just the deal closed in November.	2236.62	7.473
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:37:50] Eddy Elfenbein: They announced  it in February, just closed it in November.	2244.093	3.087
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	It’s an interesting company and I think  this deal will make them even stronger.	2247.18	6.12
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:37:59] Trey Lockerbie: Something  interesting about the company is that	2254.14	6.66
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	while it does do industrial chemicals, as you kind  of mentioned, it’s also an acidic acid is vinegar,	2260.8	4.62
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	right? So by definition, so it’s, it  goes into food and beverage products.	2265.42	3.6
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:38:09] Trey Lockerbie: So it’s interesting  that it’s falling into the consumer product	2269.02	7.62
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	side as well as the industrial market. So  it’s hitting lots of different industries,	2276.64	3.72
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	which I find fascinating as well. All  right, so shifting gears a little bit here,	2281.08	4.32
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I’d like to talk about your newsletter  because there’s some upcoming news.	2286.54	3.153
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:38:23] Trey Lockerbie: We definitely want to  get into it a little bit here. First and foremost,	2289.693	3.807
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I’d like to raise more awareness on this  newsletter. Talk a little bit more about	2293.5	4.98
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	how you started it, and I’m kind of  curious, just personally or selfishly	2298.48	4.38
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	if this is what you use to keep your hands  busy during the year. not touching that.	2303.58	3.693
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:38:41] Eddy Elfenbein: Don’t do any trading  . I understand what you’re saying. Okay. You’re	2307.273	1.136
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	calling me lazy. I understand. Newsletter,  it’s through Substack I started writing the	2308.409	3.151
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	newsletter back in 20. and it’s basically the  same thing. I would send it out so that there	2311.56	7.08
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	are two newsletters I do, there’s a free  [00:39:00] one that goes out every Tuesday,	2318.64	4.92
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and then there’s the premium paid one  that goes out late Thursday night.	2323.56	4.773
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:39:07] Eddy Elfenbein: I date it before  Friday, and every once in a while I’ll have	2328.333	3.567
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	special newsletters. If something important has  happened that I want to talk about, the Tuesday	2331.9	5.82
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	letter is more of a general, Discussion about the  markets and the economy, where the premium version	2337.72	7.68
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	talks more about exactly how we should go about  investing and what areas look good right now.	2345.4	7.113
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:39:30] Eddy Elfenbein: And I sort  of break down the companies and what I	2352.513	3.027
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	like and what I dislike, and I enjoy it.  It’s a lot of fun and it keeps me busy.	2355.54	45.48
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:39:39] Trey Lockerbie: In your most  recent newsletter, you. Quote in Q4,	2401.02	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Wall Street Analysts slash their  2023 earnings forecast by 4.4%.	2406.3	5.7
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	That’s the largest cut since 2014.  Wall Street doesn’t buy any of this.	2412.0	5.193
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:39:53] Trey Lockerbie: Over 5% talk from the  Fed. The future’s market currently expects the	2417.193	4.647
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Fed to hike by 0.25%, 25 basis points in February  and another 25 basis points in March. That would	2421.84	7.38
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	bring the target range to 4.75 to 5%. Okay, so.  The December CPI report comes out tomorrow. So	2429.22	8.58
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I’m going to ask kind of a fair question, but I  always love getting people’s real time predictions	2437.8	4.2
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	on things like this where I think the market  is expecting it to come into the mid sixties.	2442.0	4.893
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:40:23] Trey Lockerbie: Right? That  seems to be kinda the consensus. Yeah.	2446.893	1.287
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	6 65. Yeah. Where do you think it’ll come  out? Do you agree with that? And if so,	2448.18	5.04
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	what do you think the market  reaction will look like?	2453.22	2.073
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:40:33] Eddy Elfenbein: It will be 6.517462.	2455.293	4.407
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I don’t know but as I said, the more important  thing is that trend. So it’s been going,	2463.78	7.2
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it was the peak was 7.1, and this we’re  talking about the year over year rate.	2470.98	5.313
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:40:51] Eddy Elfenbein: Has declined for  the last five months in a row, and I think	2476.293	3.267
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it’s very likely that it will be number six. We’ll  learn tomorrow. I’m not worried [00:41:00] about	2479.56	5.94
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the specific numbers, but it’s the trend that  inflation appears to be receding. I’m not saying	2485.5	6.54
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	it’s fully receded or we’re in the safe zone yet,  but the trend is going in the right direction.	2492.04	6.6
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:41:13] Eddy Elfenbein: Part of that is due to  some problems with the economy, most particularly	2498.64	5.76
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	in the housing sector. This is due to the federal  reserve’s higher interest rates. So the context	2504.4	6.48
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	of the bit that you read before was a number  of Fed officials coming out. Strong rhetoric,	2510.88	8.52
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	tough talk, that they’re going to keep rates high.	2519.94	3.153
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:41:36] Eddy Elfenbein: They’re not worried  about the after effects of it, and they’re going	2523.093	4.167
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	to fight inflation until inflation is defeated.  It’s very easy for them to speak. That way to	2527.26	7.26
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	issue tough talk, but to follow through on that  is much more difficult. If the economy continues	2534.52	7.92
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	to weaken through this year, which I think is  very likely, I think the Federal Reserve will	2542.44	5.46
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	hold off on its interest rate increases,  and in fact, the future’s market thinks.	2547.9	4.953
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:42:04] Eddy Elfenbein: That the Fed will be  cutting interest rates before the end of this	2552.853	4.347
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	year. In fact, interest rates will probably be  at the same place they are right now. One year	2557.2	5.46
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	from now. It’ll be, you know, some minor  increases and then some minor decreases.	2562.66	5.04
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	But the Fed particularly Mr. Bostick was  very forthright on his comments earlier.	2567.7	7.32
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:42:27] Eddy Elfenbein: This.	2575.02	0.84
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I just don’t see it happening. And we see  it’s not just me, but it’s in the futures	2576.58	4.38
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	market. It’s in those analysts that you just  quoted. The Fed is here and the market is here,	2580.96	7.44
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and whenever that happens, the market or  reality, has a good track record of prevailing.	2588.4	7.413
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:42:48] Trey Lockerbie: You also  wrote about unemployment. Fell to 3.5%.	2595.813	3.807
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:42:52] Trey Lockerbie: This was  the sixth time the unemployment rate	2599.62	3.84
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	got to 3.5% since 1960. , the only months that  were lower came during the wars in Korea and	2603.46	7.62
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Vietnam. In other words, this was the lowest  peacetime unemployment rate in 75 years. And	2611.08	6.36
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I know by peacetime you just mean there’s  not a draft, you know, going on in the US.	2617.44	4.2
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:43:13] Trey Lockerbie: But do you think  unemployment is the linchpin here as far as	2621.64	4.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	what we’ll need to break in order for  the Fed to pivot? To actually pivot,	2626.2	4.08
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	right. Does it mean decreased rates or  do you see any other risks? And if so,	2630.28	4.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	how much do you think  unemployment will have to be?	2634.84	1.62
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:43:29] Eddy Elfenbein: Oh boy, that is a  really good question. I just don’t know exactly.	2636.46	5.673
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:43:33] Eddy Elfenbein: I  would probably think, you know,	2642.133	2.007
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	around 5% or so to see that real. There is  some rule for the Economist, which is seeing,	2644.14	9.42
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I think interest rates go up by half a  percent from their low or an average of	2654.1	4.92
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	below. So that would bring us up to about, you  know, 4% or so. I think that’s very possible.	2659.02	5.253
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:43:53] Eddy Elfenbein: Now the issue. That  could put a hamper into this disjointed nature	2664.273	9.027
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	of the economy where we’re seeing housing hit  hard, but other areas of the economy are doing	2673.3	8.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	just well. In fact, there was just an article.  In the New York Times talking about how this	2681.4	5.34
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	recession may fall harshly or unevenly on white  collar workers compared to blue collar workers.	2686.74	7.113
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:44:20] Eddy Elfenbein: I don’t know  if that will be true. So that could impact	2693.853	3.747
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	how the Fed responds. Is it broad? But  my fear is, Unemployment and the housing	2698.32	9.42
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	sector stand right between the Federal  Reserve and its goals for inflation. So	2707.74	7.14
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	they are sort of the collateral damage, but  we almost always know that’s going to happen.	2714.88	4.353
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:44:44] Eddy Elfenbein: My fear is  that the unemployment rate will rise	2719.233	3.987
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	this year and almost will have to rise this year.	2723.22	3.18
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:44:51] Trey Lockerbie: So another  interesting point from your last newsletter	2726.4	3.48
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	was that you highlighted American Waterworks.  Its ticker a w. And you gave it a very favorable	2729.88	6.54
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	review. It’s actually the stock has been  up almost 30% since mid-October of 2022.	2736.42	6.033
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:45:06] Trey Lockerbie: So it’s  been on this tear you over the last	2742.453	2.247
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	few months. I’m kind of curious  why it wasn’t included in 2022 .	2744.7	4.189
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:45:14] Eddy Elfenbein: I said such  nice things about it and I did my,	2748.889	3.791
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	my so. In the Tuesday newsletter. I like to  highlight stocks and I want to draw lessons	2753.4	6.18
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	from that. And this is an interesting  company because it’s completely boring.	2759.58	4.533
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:45:27] Eddy Elfenbein: It’s a water  utility company, and nobody had any hopes	2764.113	5.187
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	for this stock whatsoever. It was spun off  by a European subsidiary in 2008, and when	2769.3	9.18
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	they were going to do the I P O, there was no  interest in it, they talked. Would it be 25,	2778.48	5.22
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	20 $6 per share? No, nobody, they figured it  finally went off at 2150. This was in 2008.	2783.7	7.773
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:45:53] Eddy Elfenbein: And the conglomerate  got rid of it because they thought it was a	2791.473	4.167
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	no growth area and it was an anchor to them.  Nobody on Wall Street was interested in them,	2795.64	6.3
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and it has been a fantastic success  story. It’s over I’m thinking $160,	2801.94	5.58
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I think is where they are now. So up nearly  eight fold. It’s been a huge winner, as you said.	2808.06	5.613
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:46:15] Eddy Elfenbein: It’s  been up handsomely since October.	2813.673	3.027
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	So boring stocks can be great investments  and companies that nobody has any interest	2816.7	6.42
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	in. Once they’re cut loose from the mothership,  they’re free to do what they want. In many ways,	2823.12	6.96
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	they’re much better at managing themselves. So  the point I wanted to make to investors is that	2830.08	6.0
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	there’s always a place where  you could find good stocks.	2836.62	3.693
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:46:42] Eddy Elfenbein: And the thing is, when  people are told, oh, here’s a company to invest	2840.313	4.107
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	in, the first question to ask is, well, what  do they do? And that’s actually not the most	2844.42	5.22
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	important question. The most important question  is how well do they do whatever it is they do?	2849.64	6.12
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	And I almost feel so many novice investors,  they want to know, oh it’s it’s involved.	2855.76	6.704
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:47:04] Eddy Elfenbein: Artificial intelligence  or it’s involved in something with DNA technology	2862.464	6.136
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	or cybersecurity or blockchain, they want  to get into the concepts. That’s not so	2868.6	5.7
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	important. The company can be as dull as dirt  and American water work certainly is, and it’s	2874.3	6.42
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	been a huge winner over the last 14 years. and  in fact, to your point, it’s pretty pricey now.	2880.72	8.613
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:47:28] Eddy Elfenbein: I think it’s 34  times trailing earnings or maybe forward	2889.333	5.247
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	earnings as well. Also that the earnings  line or the operating earnings is nice and	2894.58	6.12
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	smooth. I really like to see that and as  an investment analyst, it really helps out	2900.7	4.86
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	seeing nice with the complete opposite would  be Celanese, where it’s all over the map.	2905.56	5.193
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:47:50] Eddy Elfenbein: It. It’s a  cool company. Just too expensive right	2910.753	4.407
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	now. I probably should have said that in  the newsletter. Yeah. It’s one but one to	2915.16	3.96
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	keep an eye on. If it does like Middleby  and tanks, I’ll certainly consider it.	2919.12	4.74
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:48:02] Trey Lockerbie: Yeah. I also  wanted to highlight that the free cash	2923.86	3.48
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	flow has gone negative over the last few  years as well, so it’s kind of, you know,	2927.34	4.02
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	hard to know when that’s going to  swing back and, and how exactly.	2931.36	3.033
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:48:11] Trey Lockerbie: Evaluate, that  kind of thing. But I want to talk a little	2934.393	3.567
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	bit about The Buy List as a whole. So you  started this in 2006 and its historical	2937.96	7.74
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	performance over its 17 year existence  is 435.73%, and that’s versus the S&P	2945.7	8.76
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	500 of 333.17%. So we’re talking about  an outperformance of over a hundred. and	2954.46	8.16
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	you know, I believe that’s an outperformance  of roughly six or so percent per year.	2962.62	3.813
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:48:41] Trey Lockerbie: Right. So that’s pretty  remarkable. Right. So I’d love to talk a little	2966.433	6.147
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	bit about how this whole thesis has been playing  out for you over this period of time. Obviously,	2972.58	4.5
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I imagine you’re more bullish than ever  on it, but are there any other insights	2977.68	4.68
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	or lessons you’ve learned over the  last 17% that you feel have led to	2982.36	4.26
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	this outperformance, other than, you  know, simply rebalancing once a year.	2986.62	4.02
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:49:04] Eddy Elfenbein: You know, people  ask, they treat the rules of the Buy List	2990.64	5.28
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	as if it’s a hindrance. And in many ways I  see it as a benefit because, so 25 stocks,	2995.92	6.96
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	we turn over five each year. So that means  it’s an average holding period of five years.	3002.88	5.04
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	So when you add a sell these or a middle B, you  think, okay, if the stock market were to shut,	3007.92	6.3
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	For the next five years on average, will I be  comfortable owning middle B five years from now?	3014.22	8.133
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:49:33] Eddy Elfenbein: Yes, I  would. It forces you to think that way	3022.353	3.927
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	because you know you are going to be married  to this stock for quite some time. Aflac, it’s	3026.28	6.6
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	on for its 18th year, Pfizer. That’s also for its  18th year. So having this, these artificial rules,	3032.88	8.46
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I think in many ways helps me because it forces  you to think about these stocks as businesses.	3041.34	7.113
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:49:58] Eddy Elfenbein: What truly  makes them valuable? Will they continue	3048.453	3.987
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	to be around? In five or 10 years. So I think  it’s a benefit of having this system. Also,	3052.44	9.06
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I don’t panic. What would’ve happened in March,  2020? What would’ve happened in late 2008? I,	3061.5	6.66
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	how would I have behaved? I don’t know. But  I know at this point I can say I just can’t.	3068.16	5.073
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:50:22] Eddy Elfenbein: I buy it and I held  right on through earnings. So it, you know, stock	3073.233	6.387
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	selection is the best when it’s  most businesslike and these rules,	3080.28	4.92
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	Forced me to be, to approach it as a  business and make business-like decisions.	3085.2	5.16
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:50:40] Trey Lockerbie: So  I’d like to learn a little bit,	3090.36	2.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	as much as you’re willing to share about Eddy  Abe’s system for finding these stocks because,	3093.24	5.76
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and I’m more curious actually,  if it’s changed over 17 years.	3099.84	3.78
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:50:51] Trey Lockerbie:	3103.62	8.7
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	What resources do you look to investigate  where you might find undervalued picks?	3117.78	5.46
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:50:57] Eddy Elfenbein: I would say, you know,	3124.74	1.14
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	mostly what I do is like to look  at the annual reports, the 10 Qs,	3125.88	5.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the 10 Ks. Look at what they’re doing, and  look at their competitors. Whenever I talk	3130.98	8.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	with officers of a company, I always like  to ask what they think of their competitors?	3139.08	5.193
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:51:15] Eddy Elfenbein: That’s always an  interesting line of inquiry. And I you know,	3144.273	6.987
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	talk to management, talk to the, you  know, PE people in investor relations,	3151.26	3.48
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	see what the company is doing. I also pay  a lot of attention to the stability of	3154.74	5.76
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the business. I pay a lot of attention  to their market position. How strong,	3160.5	5.34
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	you know, for example, SAIC, you  know, if you’re in the Pentagon,	3165.84	4.26
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	you’re going to have to deal with them at some  point because they’re just so important to what.	3170.1	4.773
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:51:42] Eddy Elfenbein: The mission is of  the Pentagon. It’s companies like that you	3174.873	4.167
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	want to find that, you know, the, it will be very  difficult to replace them. I think I talked about	3179.04	5.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	how you would replace Silgan tomorrow. It would  be very difficult. I like to look for companies	3184.14	8.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	with management I trust, so I like to hear  companies do not have to give earnings forecasts.	3192.24	7.473
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:52:04] Eddy Elfenbein: There’s nothing  and the rules that say they have to do. But	3199.713	3.267
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I like companies that do, and I like companies  that you know, that these earnings forecasts	3202.98	5.34
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	are reasonably accurate. I don’t need them to  be right. I just need them to understand the	3208.32	6.72
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	problems. I like to hear companies talk  about the problems that they’re having.	3215.04	4.773
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:52:24] Eddy Elfenbein: Also,  if you just reiterate earnings,	3219.813	2.547
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	that’s often dismissed. But I think that’s  good news. Say companies saying things are	3222.36	5.46
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	going to. As planned this year, and they  still are going. So I never overlook a	3227.82	6.96
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	reiteration of earnings. I want to just have  a great deal of trust in the management.	3234.78	4.893
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:52:43] Eddy Elfenbein: You can  never be a hundred percent perfect,	3239.673	3.207
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	but of the Ammos family that runs Aflac. These  are people I really have a high degree of faith	3242.88	6.54
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	in. I remember when the terrible earthquake  happened in Japan and Dan Amos, the CEO,	3249.42	5.88
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	said On Monday morning, when we go to work,  we plan for exactly what is happening now.	3255.3	10.56
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:53:05] Eddy Elfenbein: So we have this  covered. And ha, having that is such an enormous	3265.86	5.82
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	benefit when you go about investing the level of  trust that you can place in management, like that.	3271.68	6.0
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:53:17] Trey Lockerbie: For those who want  to follow along with this strategy. Obviously	3277.68	6.72
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	there’s the ETF, the ticker is CWS, which is  crossing Wall Street. It’s also, you know,	3284.4	4.92
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the blog and website that this is all based on.	3289.32	2.553
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:53:28] Trey Lockerbie: So I really  want to give you the opportunity to hand	3291.873	2.247
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	off to the audience about where they  can find more on crossing Wall Street,	3294.12	4.08
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the ETF, your newsletters, all of those things.	3298.2	3.033
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:53:37] Eddy Elfenbein: Sure I’ll give, I  promise I won’t give you the hard sell on the	3301.233	4.587
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	ETF, but the ticker symbol is CWS. And  I started this with my business partner.	3305.82	5.133
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:53:46] Eddy Elfenbein: I never thought,  how do you just start an ETF? But we did,	3310.953	3.267
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	if we were able to get, and I think I looked  at the latest numbers and I think every year,	3314.22	4.74
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	hundreds of ETFs closeup shop. We’re in our  seventh year. I looked at the numbers earlier	3318.96	6.06
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	today. I think we’re going to close all  the time. For AUM assets under management.	3325.02	5.913
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:54:07] Eddy Elfenbein: So we  are growing and thriving. We beat	3330.933	3.507
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the market. We just got our fifth star  from Morningstar. We’re also the first	3334.44	5.04
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	ETF in the history of the world to have a fulcrum  fee. So the fee, if we. Don’t beat the market,	3339.48	7.86
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	then the fees go down. If we do beat the market,  then I get a little bonus, the fees go up.	3347.34	6.573
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:54:30] Eddy Elfenbein: So it all  depends. Basically, If I do well,	3353.913	3.387
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I do well. If we don’t do well, I don’t do well.  So my interests are aligned with yours. We are	3357.3	5.82
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	this tiny fund and we are the first ones. They’re  open-ended funds, but we were the first ETF to do	3363.12	6.12
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	so. I never chose a ticker symbol before, so  that was something of a unique experience.	3369.24	6.153
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:54:51] Eddy Elfenbein: So CWS was open, so we  jumped on that. It’s traded on the New York Arca.	3375.393	6.927
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	You may remember, that was the Archipelago, which  was bought by the NYSE, which is owned by ICE,	3382.32	6.72
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	which is another buy list. If you were to buy one  share of each of the 25 stocks on The Buy List,	3389.04	8.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	that would run about $4,500, but you  can get the whole thing in one package.	3397.14	5.493
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:55:18] Eddy Elfenbein: I think  it’s right now about $47.40 per share.	3402.633	4.887
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	We started at $25 back in September  of 2016, and so we’re just growing,	3407.52	8.1
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	thriving, getting more converts out there.  So it’s been a learning experience. Now,	3415.62	6.72
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I’m also on Twitter @EddyElfenbein. At Substack,  it’s cws.substack.com where I have my newsletters,	3423.24	11.16
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	the free newsletter, if you just want to  try that out, it comes out every Tuesday.	3434.4	4.233
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:55:54] Eddy Elfenbein: And then if you  want to join us for the premium letter,	3438.633	4.587
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	that’s $20 a month or $200. For a whole year  and that comes out I date it for Friday morning,	3443.22	7.44
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	and I’ve been doing that for a couple  years now, and I really enjoy it.	3450.66	4.244
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:56:10] Trey Lockerbie: And you are  one of my favorite follows on Twitter,	3454.904	3.676
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	so I highly recommend people do follow.	3458.58	2.253
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:56:14] Trey Lockerbie: Your humor is  always refreshing, part of my feed. So Eddy,	3460.833	4.587
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	I just love everything you’re doing here. I think  it’s incredible. I’m so honored you came back	3465.42	3.24
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	on the show a year later. I hope we can make it  an annual tradition at this point. Maybe we can	3468.66	4.5
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	keep following up and going over, because I love  this strategy and I think it’s so fascinating.	3473.16	4.233
Edle_thAU0s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edle_thAU0s	[00:56:30] Trey Lockerbie: So thanks  again and I hope we’ll see you in 2024.	3477.393	2.88

qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:00:03] Clay Finck: Welcome to The  Investor’s Podcast. I’m your host,	15.112	2.288
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	clay Fink. On today’s episode, I wanted  to cover four wide moat companies I think	17.4	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	are worth the consideration  for stock investors in 2023.	22.86	3.3
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Given we’re in a bear market and teetering on a  recession, the prices of the majority of stocks	26.94	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	are down, giving us the opportunity to potentially  add to wonderful companies at discounted prices.	32.7	6.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:00:27] If you’ve been following along with  the show for quite some time, you know that Warren	38.7	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Buffett loves companies with wide moats. These are  the companies that are most equipped to handle the	43.14	7.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	constant disruption occurring in the capitalistic  marketplace. However, even some of the widest moat	50.22	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and highest quality companies can be a poor  investment if you pay too high of a price.	55.8	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:00:49] So we also brought  price into consideration when	60.72	3.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	selecting these four companies.  With that, let’s dive right in.	63.72	1.905
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:01:19] Before we get into the companies I’ll  be covering today, let’s make it clear what it	65.625	4.935
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	really means for a company to have a wide moat  and why it’s important for a company to have it	70.56	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	as long-term investors. It is critical that the  companies we invest in have a strong economic	75.48	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	moat, which is simply a distinct competitive  advantage that a company has over its competitors.	81.18	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:01:41] We want to be certain that  if you’re going to own a company for	86.88	3.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the next 10 or 20 years, we’re fairly  certain that the company’s products or	90.42	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	services will still be desired. Because  if a company ends up getting disrupted,	95.04	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	then it’s likely that the SOC won’t  end up being a good investment. Warren	99.54	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Buffett says that a good business is like  a strong castle with a deep moat around it.	104.22	5.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:02:04] I want sharks in the moat. I want it  to be untouched. There are a number of different	110.1	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	types of moats that can exist in the marketplace.  One of the most well-known types of moats is a	115.38	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	network effect, which is the phenomenon where  the value of the network becomes more valuable	121.08	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	as more people join the network, which is the  case with many social media companies because	126.66	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	these companies become more valuable with each  new user that joins the social media network.	131.58	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:02:31] Another common type of moat or  competitive advantage is simply the brand. If I’m	136.74	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	overseas in Europe or another country and I want  to go grab a can of pop, odds are I’m going to be	142.44	6.06
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	more likely to grab something like a Coca-Cola  rather than another brand I’ve never seen in	148.5	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	my life. Another example is I enjoy working out  and whenever I go and get new workout shoes, I	153.3	6.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	oftentimes pick Nike, even though I could probably  get some other brand for a little bit cheaper.	159.3	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:02:58] That’s a similar quality. I just  know what I’m gonna get with Nike. And they	164.4	4.32
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	have that brand power and brand awareness  with millions of people worldwide. Other	168.72	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	types of moats include being the low-cost  provider, having high switching costs,	173.7	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	having economies of scale, or a company being  essentially like a toll booth that collects a	178.2	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	fee for being the sole provider of  one particular product or service.	183.42	3.84
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:03:21] Much of what constitutes a moat can be  very qualitative, but these qualitative factors	187.26	6.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	can be validated using quantitative factors. If  a company is consistently able to produce high	193.38	6.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	returns on invested capital, while consistently  pricing their products higher than their	199.5	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	competitors, Then that is probably a good sign  that the company has a strong and durable moat,	204.3	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	because a lot of times when companies are  able to achieve high returns on capital,	208.98	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	competition comes in and makes it no longer  possible to achieve those high returns.	213.42	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:03:53] Looking at a company’s revenue,  their earnings per share and the return on	218.7	3.78
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Avea capital are all good places to check  and see if a company has a durable and	222.48	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	longstanding moat to. In addition  to a company having a strong moat,	227.46	4.32
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	I also want to ensure that the company has a  growth runway ahead of it, continuing to grow	231.78	5.4
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	their earnings, and the company is trading  at what I believe to be a reasonable price.	237.18	4.14
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:04:15] They have a solid management  team, high returns on invested capital,	241.32	3.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and also I want to be in companies that aren’t  too cyclical. Looking for companies with these	244.86	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	characteristics are ingredients for  what I call a steady compounder,	250.44	4.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which I would consider to be a company that is  almost certain to continue to grow and continually	254.52	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	just steadily march their earnings per share  higher, and hopefully the stock price as well.	260.46	5.04
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:04:40] Because of the high quality of these  types of businesses, the market oftentimes won’t	265.5	5.4
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	hand you these companies for super cheap, so  they aren’t going to make you rich overnight.	270.9	4.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	One of my very favorite value investing books	276.42	2.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	is a book called Where the Money Is by  Adam Zeel. TIP had Adam on our podcast,	278.94	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	on our Millennial Investing show, and the  We Study Billionaires show in the past.	284.46	3.9
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:05:03] His book talks about how value  investors need to transition to a world	288.36	4.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	that is vastly dominated by technology  and value. Investors should not shy away	293.22	5.34
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	from technology companies because of how much  stronger some of these companies have become	298.56	4.56
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	in the tremendous moats in network  effects that technology has enabled.	303.12	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:05:22] In his book, Adam states that  Peter Lynch wrote and one up on Wall Street,	307.56	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	that in the end, superior companies will succeed  and mediocre companies will fail, and investors in	312.3	7.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	each will be rewarded accordingly. Lynch’s words  remain as true as ever, but the problem is that	319.38	6.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	over the last generation, technological change has  altered the economy so much that the nature and	325.92	6.66
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	character of what constitutes a superior business  has also dramatically changed the internet.	332.58	5.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:05:52] The cell phone and social  media didn’t exist when Lynch wrote this.	338.46	3.78
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Many of the everyday examples that he used to  illustrate superior businesses are now laughably	342.78	5.82
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	out of. That’s no knock on Peter Lynch. The  world changes, but we must acknowledge that	348.6	6.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the same common sense that led him to those  stocks now tells us to go nowhere near them.	354.72	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:06:14] The internal combustion automobile  today faces threats from both driverless and	360.48	5.04
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	electric cars. And as for toys, arrest. Squeeze  between the giant printers of Walmart and	365.52	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	e-commerce if filed for bankruptcy protection  in 2017, powered by continued improvements in	371.1	6.36
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	computing power and related technologies, digital  companies have transformed our daily lives,	377.46	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the world economy, and most importantly, for  the purposes of this book, the stock market.	383.4	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:06:43] Roughly half of the US markets  gained since 2011 have come from the information	388.32	6.06
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	technology and related sectors. Since 2016,  roughly two thirds of the market’s appreciation	394.38	7.26
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	has come from these sectors. A decade ago,  only two of the world’s top 10 most valuable	401.64	6.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	publicly traded companies not controlled  by the government were digital enterprises.	408.18	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:07:07] Today as the chart below  shows, eight of the top 10 are the	412.98	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	only two companies that aren’t technology  based are Berkshire Hathaway and an oil	417.6	4.14
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	company outta the Middle East. As the  graphic suggests, the digital age has	421.74	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	come upon us so quickly that we haven’t had  time to step back and parse what it means.	426.54	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:07:26] While it’s obvious to everyone that  something dramatic and lasting has occurred,	431.82	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	most investors seem befuddled by. As a result,	436.62	3.6
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	most haven’t learned the language and the  dynamics of a sector whose principle output	440.22	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	consists of zeros and ones. To say that this  is unfortunate would be an understatement.	445.44	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:07:45] Companies built on a digital  foundation, tech in the shorthand of Wall Street,	450.54	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	are creating most of the incremental wealth  in the world today. Tech dominates our daily	455.52	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	lives so thoroughly that it’s natural to think  that digital revolution is largely complete,	461.04	5.34
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	but that’s not true in many ways. It’s just  beginning, even after a generation of growth.	466.38	6.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:08:06] Amazon’s annual retail sales volume  only now matches Walmart’s. Cloud computing,	472.5	6.18
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which today accounts for roughly 10 to 15%  of all spending on information technology,	478.68	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which one day will likely account for more than  two thirds. Intuit, the world’s leading provider	483.36	5.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	of small business accounting software reaches  only one to 2% of its ultimate addressable market.	489.24	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:08:29] The list goes on and on,  and as computing power compounds,	494.82	4.26
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the list gets longer every. As tech  creates new industries and new wealth,	499.08	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	it is simultaneously hollowing out large parts  of the legacy economy. Tech’s dramatic rise	504.3	6.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	has been accompanied by an astonishing  fall of the old economy’s market values.	510.84	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:08:50] Big tech gets most of the  headlines, but hundreds of smaller,	515.64	4.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	lesser known tech companies have also continued  to appreciate. Then a few pages later,	519.72	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	he describes how one of the reasons  that tech is taking over is because	525.18	3.48
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the returns on capital employed are just so  much higher. As he says that if Ford wants to	528.66	5.34
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	grow their business, they need to invest  $10 to achieve $1 an additional profit.	534.0	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:09:13] For Coca-Cola, they need to  invest $6 for $1 in profit. And for so	539.28	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	many of these big tech companies,  they only need to invest, you know,	544.2	3.48
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	two or $3 to generate the same level  of profits as these legacy businesses.	547.68	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	So because of these reasons, many technology  companies are just better businesses and they	552.96	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	have wider moats than these other businesses,  I want to ensure that I at least consider	558.06	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	these types of companies when I’m picking and  choosing individual stocks for my own portfolio.	562.56	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:09:42] The first two companies I’m  going to cover today are well known	567.36	4.38
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	big tech companies as these are just some of  the strongest moats the world has ever seen,	571.74	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and I like the prices they’re trading at.  And then the other two companies I’ll cover	576.54	4.14
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	are companies outside of Big Tech. The first  company I wanted to discuss today was Alphabet.	580.68	6.3
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Buffett and Munger aren’t considered the  geniuses or masterminds of technology,	586.98	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	but they’ve both commented on the strength of  the moats of Al. Munger has stated that he’s	591.9	6.24
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	never seen a company with as wide of a moat as  Google’s, although it appears that alphabet’s	598.14	5.82
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	moat may be in question. With the rise of AI and  technologies like Chat, G P T, Alphabet today is	603.96	6.42
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	one of the most dominant and profitable companies  in the world, as in the trailing 12 months.	610.38	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:10:29] They posted annual netet income  just shy of $67 billion. The primary source	615.3	6.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	of Alphabet’s moat is the competitive  advantages built in Google search	622.02	3.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	through their network effect. Once Google  established itself as a leader in search,	625.74	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	more and more people started using Google  for their search queries. And the more	630.84	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	people that started using Google search,  the more data they were able to collect,	635.52	4.2
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which not only improves the Google search,  but it also improved their targeted.	639.72	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:10:59] For how valuable of a product Google  search is for its users. It’s pretty incredible	644.4	5.4
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	that it’s just totally free, which is the beauty  of technology and the power that it brings to	649.8	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	people. Alphabet is a trillion-dollar company  built primarily on the back of a product that	654.72	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	is free for its users, and one could also  include YouTube in that discussion as well.	660.66	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:11:19] Because of this dynamic and network  effect, the search market has essentially turned	665.16	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	into a winner take all industry. As Google Search  currently holds 84% of the search market according	670.14	6.6
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	to Stata, which essentially hasn’t really budged  at all over the past decade. This also reminds	676.74	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	me of Geiss Spear and what he looks for in  businesses to invest in and Nick Sleep as well.	682.68	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:11:41] To add to that discussion, This  is win-win scenarios. All parties win using	687.42	5.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Alphabet’s platform. Whether that be the  users or the advertisers. Everyone wins in	693.3	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	working with Alphabet and Google search  and when I pull up Datarama to see what	698.52	4.56
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Super Investors own Alphabet, I see Guy  Spear owns a little bit in his portfolio.	703.08	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:12:02] And then also Bill Miller, Bill  Nygren, Lilu, Francois Rochon, Tom Gayner, and	707.52	7.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	a long list of others. All own Alphabet and their  funds. Portfolios as well. Google search also	714.96	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	has a really powerful brand and people associate  Google with the internet itself. So in a way it’s	720.42	6.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	almost a toll road on the internet where so many  people are using Google in their everyday life.	726.42	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:12:25] So their brand name also has  substantial value for the company. However,	731.22	4.14
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	their brand alone isn’t as powerful as a company  like Apple, for example. And I think YouTube has	735.36	6.3
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	a lot of many of the same characteristics as  Google search. I’ve recently tuned into the	741.66	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	podcast episode of Mr. Beast and Lex Friedman and  Mr. Beast just makes me so bullish on YouTube,	747.36	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	given the huge staying power that YouTube has,  where it’s kind of the toll road for videos. And	753.06	6.48
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	it’s just provided so much value for creators,  for advertisers, and for users. And I see	759.54	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	YouTube in many ways in the same light as Google  Search, and I’m very bullish on both long term.	765.0	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:13:05] So Google Search I obviously believe  is a great business, but Alphabet also has two	770.46	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	other fast growing businesses within the  company. I already mentioned YouTube,	776.04	3.78
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and then Google Cloud is another  fast growing business that they.	779.82	3.3
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	YouTube produced nearly 30 billion  in revenue in the trailing 12 months,	783.84	5.4
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and Google Cloud produced revenues of over 24  billion, which are both growing very rapidly.	789.24	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:13:29] YouTube remarkably is still  growing its user base and has 2.6 billion	795.0	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	users globally. I am a shareholder in Alphabet,  but one of my main concerns with the company is	800.52	6.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	how well their advertising revenue will hold  up during a recession. During a recession and	807.06	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	difficult economic times, companies are forced  to cut back on spending to remain profitable,	812.22	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and oftentimes the very first place they’re going  to cut spending is in their advertising budget.	816.96	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:13:56] During the great financial crisis,  advertising revenue fell sharply but quickly	822.06	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	rebounded once economic conditions improved  for alphabet. Alphabet’s advertising revenue	827.04	5.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	has held up remarkably well in recent months,  which is really good to see. As of Q3 of 2022,	832.92	6.48
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Google searches revenue was up 4% year over  year, and their overall revenue was up 6%.	839.4	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:14:19] If you take the free cash flow and  subtract out roughly 19 billion in assumed	844.92	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	stock-based compensation, I’m getting a  free cash flow yield of roughly 4%. For	850.68	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	a company I expect to continue to grow for  many years to. And this is after subtracting	855.96	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	out the net cash from the market cap for  those following along with those numbers.	860.88	4.26
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:14:39] I’m not trying to make  it sound like I’m pumping the stock,	865.14	2.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	but at a free cash flow yield of 4%.  For a company of this high quality,	867.84	4.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	I will gladly purchase this stock around  90, a hundred dollars. Of course, it could	872.7	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	go lower and receive a lot of pressure with the  recession, but I will gladly hold right onto it.	878.22	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:14:58] Now most people are probably  concerned about chat G P T and the	883.98	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	disruption that may be coming from them.  There was recent news that came out from	888.48	4.14
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Microsoft. They reportedly planned  to invest 10 billion into the company	892.62	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	open ai. Who developed this software? This  investment would value open AI at $29 billion.	897.9	6.78
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:15:19] Even Bezos, one of the most ambitious  entrepreneurs on the planet, has stated that you	904.68	5.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	should treat Google like a mountain. You can  climb it, but you can’t move it. And Microsoft	910.56	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	has long been wanting to get into the search  business as over the years they’ve spent over	916.14	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	$15 billion on being only to fail to tap into  Google’s market share of the search industry.	920.64	6.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:15:41] I got this stat from Adam Cecil’s book  where the money is, here’s what Adam had to say	926.76	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	about Google in his book that was written just  last year. Microsoft and Amazon wanted a piece	932.04	6.3
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	of Google’s actions so badly because search  is likely the Internet’s mightiest and most	938.34	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	profitable. Toll bridge search is quite literally  the gateway to the information superhighway.	944.1	5.37
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:16:04] Amazon may control e-commerce,  but physical goods account for only 25 to	949.47	6.15
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	30% of economic. Services accounts for the  other 70 to 75% and services is where Google	955.62	7.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	excels. Anyone in the world who wants  a divorce lawyer, a mortgage broker,	963.24	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	or information on a Caribbean vacation, googles  it, which means that every divorce lawyer,	968.16	6.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	every mortgage broker, and every Caribbean  related travel business must advertise on Google.	974.16	6.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:16:34] The best part is that advertisers  don’t mind paying Google because advertising	980.16	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	on its site is both cheaper and more effective  than advertising on traditional media. When a	986.1	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	travel agent or a divorce lawyer advertises on  TV or in the local newspaper, they’re unsure,	991.86	6.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	their message will reach its intended audience  On Google, advertisements are tied to keywords,	997.98	6.36
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	so advertisers can measure whether  their spending is effective or not.	1004.34	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:17:04] I discussed Google with Adam Zeel  during my conversation with him on millennial	1009.14	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	investing, and he was describing to me how  despite Alphabet being highly profitable today,	1014.84	5.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	they aren’t as optimized for profits as a company  like Apple, for example. They are still very	1020.72	6.06
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	much making large investments for the future,  which really leads me to believe that the free	1026.78	4.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	cash flow amounts that we’re seeing today are  largely understated, at least to some degree.	1031.64	5.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:17:32] To round out the discussion on  Alphabet, I wanted to end it with a clip from	1037.52	4.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Bill Nygren where he digs into this idea further  on the millennial investing show. Here it is.	1042.38	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:17:42] Bill Nygren: Yeah. It’s  funny. I think a lot of times people	1047.9	2.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	get the idea that value investors are stuck  investing in below average businesses,	1050.78	6.6
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	what Warren Buffett or Benjamin Graham  called the cigar, but companies,	1057.38	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	but to us, value just means that you’re  getting a lot more than you’re paying.	1062.06	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:18:01] And through some of these  accounting issues where a company is	1066.5	6.78
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	making a lot of investments for the future that  aren’t creating current earnings, it’s creating	1073.28	5.64
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the misperception that the company’s expensive.  , you look at a company like Alphabet and they’re	1078.92	6.18
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	investing a tremendous amount in autonomous  vehicles, in healthcare, in Google Cloud.	1085.1	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:18:25] None of which really is earning any  money today. In fact, it’s losing significant	1090.8	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	money. We think about it like if they made those  investments with a venture capital firm instead,	1096.5	6.36
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the accounting would be very different. It would  be a big asset that goes on their balance sheet	1102.86	5.34
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and the losses that are going  through Those venture companies	1108.2	4.02
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	don’t go through the income  statement, so we have them.	1112.22	2.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:18:49] So when we look piece by piece  at the values, we separate out the cash,	1114.98	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	we look at the venture camp investments  that aren’t earning money. We look at the	1120.26	4.56
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	under monetized investments like YouTube  at Alphabet, that’s still through either	1124.82	6.18
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	subscriptions or advertising as monetizing at a  fraction of what other streaming services are.	1131.0	5.4
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:19:10] And we do a piece by piece  valuation. And when we sum up the parks,	1136.4	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	we, , subtract that from the stock price  and say, we’re really getting the search	1141.68	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	business at lesser market multiple. And as  we move to more and more of a business world	1146.3	6.84
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	that’s based on intangible assets, intellectual  property, venture capital like investing r and.	1153.14	7.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:19:35] We think there are more and  more of these opportunities where really	1160.94	4.38
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	good businesses look like they’re selling  at an expensive PE ratio, but by the time	1165.32	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	you do the work and dig into it, there’s a  core piece of the business that everybody	1170.78	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	agrees is a great business and we think we’re  buying them at less than the market multiple.	1175.28	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:19:54] So to us, this is still  just as much value investing as	1180.44	3.96
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	buying GM at six times earnings was,  it’s just a little more complicated to	1184.4	4.837
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:20:02] Clay Finck: get. To add to  what Bill is saying with the earnings	1189.237	3.563
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	on alphabet. I also wanted to pull  in one more line from Adam Cecil’s.	1192.8	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Tech companies could report dramatically  higher current earnings if they wanted to.	1197.42	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:20:16] It’s just not in their best interest  to do so early in their life cycles and with only	1202.64	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	a fraction of their markets conquered. Digital  businesses are in growth rather than harvest mode.	1208.16	6.06
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	They are wisely spending dollars today that will  be worth more dollars in the future. Such spending	1214.22	6.48
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	makes the E in the PE ratio look small and the  multiple of current earnings to look large.	1220.7	6.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:20:41] But that is a misleading and deceptive  snapshot of reality. It’s especially misleading	1226.7	6.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	when we are comparing tech companies, which  are reinvesting heavily in the future to	1233.24	5.04
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	legacy companies, most of which are not.  To compare Amazon’s or alphabet’s current	1238.28	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	profits to Wells Fargo is like comparing an apple  orchard in the springtime to an apple orchard.	1243.5	5.82
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:21:03] In the fall, the ladder is  ready for harvest while the former is	1249.32	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	just beginning to grow. End. All right.  Now, the second company I wanted to talk	1253.76	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	about today is Amazon. Amazon is another  widely held company amongst super investors,	1258.26	6.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and I believe that’s for good reasons.  Investors including Bill Miller,	1264.26	4.14
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Bill Nygren, Tom Gayner, and even Warren  Buffett all have exposure to Amazon stock.	1268.4	6.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:21:28] When Bill Miller was asked what  the best investment decision he’s ever made,	1274.52	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	he said it’s buying the Amazon IPO.  And then when he is asked what the	1279.26	4.32
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	worst financial decision he’s ever made,  it was ever selling a share of Amazon. I	1283.58	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	tuned into a recent interview Bill Miller  did with Wealth Track at the end of 2021.	1289.16	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:21:48] He stated that his estimate of  what Amazon AW w s is worth is around 1.5	1293.96	6.18
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	trillion if it were valued. Similar to other  SaaS companies. But Amazon’s total valuation	1300.14	6.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	today here at the start of 2023, is around 1  trillion. So the total value of the company	1306.68	6.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	is valued at 1 trillion while Bill Miller’s  estimate of AW w s alone is 1.5 trillion.	1313.4	6.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:22:14] Here’s a clip of Warren  Buffett talking about Berkshire’s	1319.94	4.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	investment in Amazon when he was  questioned. Whether it falls within	1324.02	3.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	a value investor’s framework back  during the 2019 annual meeting.	1327.74	3.6
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:22:26] Interviewer: This question is  from Ken Scar Beck in Indianapolis. He says,	1331.34	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	with the full understanding that Warren had no  input on the Amazon purchase and that relative	1337.1	5.04
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	to Berkshire, it’s likely a small stake,  the investment still caught me off guard.	1342.14	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	I’m wondering if I should begin to think  differently about Berkshire looking out,	1346.76	3.78
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	say, 20 years, might we be seeing a shift  in investment philosophy away from value	1350.54	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	investing principles that the current  management has practiced for 70 years?	1356.12	3.66
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:22:54] Amazon is a great company,  yet it would seem it’s heady shares.	1359.78	4.38
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	10 years into a bull market appeared  to conflict with being fearful when	1364.16	4.56
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	others are greedy. Considering this in  other recent investments like Stone Co,	1368.72	4.2
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	should we be preparing for a change in the price  versus value decisions that built Berkshire?	1372.92	4.56
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:23:12] Warren Buffett: Yeah, it’s  interesting that the term value investing	1377.48	3.78
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	came up because I can assure you that both  managers who, and one of them bought some	1381.26	5.4
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Amazon stock in the last quarter, which  we’ll get reported in another week,	1386.66	4.32
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	or 10 days. He is a value investor. The idea that  value is somehow connected to book value or low	1390.98	6.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	price earnings ratios or anything, as Charlie  has said, all investing is value investing.	1397.7	4.2
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:23:35] I mean, you, you’re, you’re putting  out some money now to get more later on and you’re	1401.9	3.96
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	making a calculation. As to the probabilities  of getting that money and when you’ll get it,	1405.86	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and what interest rates will be in between  an all the same calculation goes into it,	1410.36	4.02
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	whether you’re buying some  bank at 70% of book value,	1414.38	2.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	or you’re buying Amazon at some high, very  high mobile poll of reported earnings.	1417.32	4.38
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:23:55] The people making the decision on  Amazon are absolutely much value investors as	1421.7	6.18
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	I was when I was looking around for all these  things selling below working capital, , years	1427.88	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	ago. So that has not changed. The two people  that one of whom made the investment in Amazon,	1432.32	5.64
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	they are looking at many hundreds  of securities and they can look at	1438.68	4.38
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	more than I can because they’re managing less  money in their possible universes , greater,	1443.06	6.9
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	but they are looking for things that they  feel, they understand what will be developed	1449.96	6.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	by that business between now and judgment  day and cash and, and it’s, it’s not a sales.	1456.08	5.61
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:24:35] Current sales can make or  some difference. Current profit margins	1461.69	4.77
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	can make some difference. Tangible  assets, excess cash, excess debt,	1466.46	4.38
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	all of those things go into making a calculation  as to whether they should buy A versus B versus C,	1470.84	6.84
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and they are got, they’re absolutely  following value principle. They don’t	1477.68	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	necessarily agree with each other or  agree with me, but they are very smart,	1483.62	4.14
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	they are totally committed to Berkshire and, and  they’re very good and human beings on top of it.	1487.76	6.48
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:25:07] Charlie Munger: Warren and I are  a little older than some people and damn near	1494.24	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	everybody. Yeah, and we’re not the most flexible  probably in the whole world. And of course,	1500.18	6.96
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	if something as extreme as this ever development  happens and you don’t catch it way other people,	1507.14	7.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	green boy blow by you. And I don’t  mind not having caught Amazon early.	1514.82	6.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:25:33] The guy is kind of a miracle  worker. It’s very peculiar. I, I give	1520.94	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	myself a pass on that, but I feel like ours  is asked for not identifying Google better.	1525.86	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	I think Warren feels the same way.	1531.74	2.433
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:25:46] Warren Buffett: Yeah.	1534.173	0.42
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:25:46] Charlie Munger: We, we screwed up.	1534.593	1.587
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:25:48] He’s saying we  blew itand we did have some	1536.18	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	insights into that because we were using them  at Geico and we were seeing the results produced	1541.46	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and we saw that we were paying $10 a click or  whatever it might have been for something that	1546.2	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	had a marginal cost of them, was exactly  zero. And, we saw it was working for us.	1550.88	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:26:08] So we could see in our own operations  how well that Google advertising was working.	1556.46	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and we just sat there sucking our thumbs,  so we’re ashamed. We’re trying to atone	1561.62	6.213
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:26:19] Warren Buffett: When he says sucking	1567.833	1.407
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	our thumbs. I’m just glad he  didn’t use some other example.	1569.24	2.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:26:25] Clay Finck: Now, from a high level,  Amazon was a really big beneficiary of the	1571.46	6.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Covid pandemic as the trend to e-commerce  and online shopping really accelerated.	1578.0	5.04
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:26:34] And despite that, the stock has  been getting hammered in recent months.	1583.04	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	At the time of this recording,  it sits at around $97, which is	1588.56	3.9
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	nearly 50% below. Its all time high  and is just slightly above the March,	1592.46	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	2020 low. Let’s talk about the moat this company  has, starting with their e-commerce business.	1598.04	6.3
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:26:56] Without a doubt, this company has one  of the strongest moats to ever exist in my. In	1604.34	6.84
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	2014, Amazon did 39 billion in e-commerce  sales, and in 2022, E-commerce sales are	1611.18	8.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	estimated to be around 142 billion. I think of  Amazon as similar to Google search in that it’s	1619.7	6.66
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	a toll road on the internet. It established  that early lead, and now when anyone wants	1626.36	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	to purchase something online, oftentimes the  first place they’re gonna go is to Amazon.	1631.52	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:27:28] To help lock in their customers and  keep them coming back time and time again. They	1636.26	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	implemented Amazon Prime with their two day  shipping. Currently Amazon Prime costs $15	1641.78	5.4
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	a month or $139 on an annual basis in the us.  I’d imagine that many American households can’t	1647.18	7.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	really imagine living without their Amazon Prime  membership and all the benefits that it offers.	1654.92	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:27:51] Just from 2019 through 2021, the  number of prime members increased from 150	1659.9	8.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	million. To 200 million. So this company is  definitely still in growth mode despite being	1668.36	6.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	just such a large business. Today, I see quite  a bit of optionality with Amazon’s e-commerce	1674.9	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	business. First is the potential to profit off of  every single sale that occurs on their platform.	1680.66	5.64
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:28:17] Since this is a business built  on the internet, they are easily able to	1686.3	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	tweak the pricing of their products that they  sell on Amazon, or tweak the fees that they	1690.8	4.2
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	charge for others that sell on. This is also  referenced as their third party seller service.	1695.0	5.82
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	So they have the revenue they’re  collecting from the selling themselves.	1701.36	3.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:28:36] They have revenue from the third party  seller services, and then they have revenue from	1704.48	4.26
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Amazon Prime. And last but not least, they  have their revenue from their advertising	1708.74	4.2
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	business. Their advertising business unit is  extremely valuable because when someone searches	1712.94	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	for an item on Amazon, they enter that search  query with the intention of buying a product.	1718.4	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:28:55] This leads to massive amount of dollars  spent on advertising to try and catch these users	1723.86	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	attention. I was chatting with John Huber on  millennial investing back on episode 1 65,	1729.56	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and during that episode he talked a lot about  how good of a business the digital ad segment is,	1735.26	5.34
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and how much more valuable those ads  are given that the customers seeing	1740.6	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	those ads entered the search query  with the intent of making a purchase.	1745.1	3.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:29:20] A lot of people talk about  the e-commerce space and E A W S,	1748.82	3.84
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	but the digital ads business may also be a really  big driver for Amazon’s stock performance over	1752.66	5.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the coming decade. I’d encourage the audience  to check out that episode with John Huber if	1758.54	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	they’d like to learn more about why John made  Amazon his largest stock position in his fund.	1763.16	5.82
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:29:40] Amazon’s advertising business  grew by 25% in the most recent quarter,	1768.98	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and in the trailing 12 months, their ad business  generated over 35 billion in revenue. And then	1773.78	6.66
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	last but not least, Amazon’s cash cow is their  AWS business. This business in the trailing 12	1780.44	6.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	months generated 76 billion in revenue with  revenues in Q3 of 2022, increasing by 27%.	1786.56	8.34
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:30:07] Their AWS business is not only a  very large and very fast growing business,	1794.9	6.06
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	it’s also very high margins as EBIT margins  are 30% and give Amazon the cash needed to	1800.96	7.26
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	help fund the ever-growing retail business and  other necessary investments they’re making in	1808.22	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	their continued future growth. In relation to  Amazon’s moat, let’s not forget that Nick Sleep,	1813.2	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	who’s an investor that puts so much  emphasis on quality still to this day,	1818.66	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	as far as we know, has owned  Amazon stock for the last 20 years.	1823.58	4.02
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:30:39] When Sleep was researching the best  companies to own, he discovered the incredible	1827.6	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	power of companies with what he calls scaled  economy. Meaning that as the companies grow,	1832.1	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	they’re able to continue to  offer lower and lower prices,	1838.04	3.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which in turn only attracts more and more  customers. It’s the ultimate win-win situation.	1841.16	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:30:58] So Sleep identified Amazon,  Costco, and Berkshire Hathaway back in	1846.62	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the early two thousands and put his entire  net worth practically in these three stocks.	1851.54	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	That’s not to say that we should invest in  whatever companies the super investors buy,	1856.04	4.56
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	but I believe that Amazon has a  very large moat around its business.	1860.6	4.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:31:16] Amazon, over the many years  continues to ensure that they’re providing	1864.68	4.32
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	low prices to customers, especially  since many of them are signing up for	1869.0	4.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	their annual prime membership. In order to  provide that fast and easy two day shipping,	1873.08	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Amazon had to spend so much money  to build out that fulfillment.	1878.3	4.56
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:31:35] Because of the amount of capital that  took to build all that out. This is just another	1882.86	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	factor that plays into their moat because they  have all these fulfillment centers and it becomes	1888.32	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	extremely difficult for other companies  to compete in, achieve profitable margins.	1893.3	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	In addition to all the capital they’ve had to  invest, they also have immense network effects,	1898.28	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	especially with Amazon Prime, essentially locking	1903.44	2.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	customers in giving these customers massive  incentives to continue to shop on Amazon.	1906.02	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:32:02] The network effects also tie into  the scaled economy share that Nick Sleep	1910.94	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	describes as they’re able to continually have  a cost advantage over the long. As the company	1915.38	6.12
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	continues to grow year in and year out, I did a  bit of research into Amazon’s market share and	1921.5	7.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	how that’s trending as well. I’m seeing varying  statistics from different sources, but multiple	1928.58	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	more conservative sources stated that in 2021,  Amazon accounted for 40% of all e-commerce sales.	1933.8	7.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:32:33] Walmart, of course, is also making  a push for e-commerce and is growing as well,	1941.66	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	but today they only account for around 6%  of e-commerce sales. Amazon also has the	1946.16	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	largest cloud business in the world with aws  and with the continued increase in spend and	1952.1	5.82
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	commitments on aws, more and more companies  are getting locked into that AWS ecosystem,	1957.92	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and there’s high switching cost if they ever  wanted to switch to another cloud provider.	1963.5	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:32:59] Recently, Amazon’s free cash flows  have dipped into the negative territory,	1968.12	4.26
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	dragging the stock down with it.  BuTIPersonally believe that these	1972.38	3.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	headwinds from a free cash flow perspective  are temporary. When I look at the company’s	1976.1	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	top line for each of their important business  segments, I see strong and consistent growth.	1980.6	5.64
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:33:17] And when I look at the big picture  and the secular trends of e-commerce and the	1986.24	4.32
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	cloud industries, Amazon is a massive beneficiary  for these trends. I believe that if Amazon really	1990.56	6.66
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	wanted to produce a ton of free cash flow  in the near term, they could definitely do	1997.22	4.02
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	that. But instead they’re opting to continue to  reinvest back into the growth of the company and	2001.24	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	reinvest and create that customer goodwill  by continually offering those low prices.	2006.34	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:33:43] I dunno when the situation will  improve in terms of Amazon’s financials,	2011.08	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	but when the stock price of a great company drops  by 50% and is trading below what I believe the	2015.76	6.24
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	value to be, then I think when the financials  improve and the economy eventually recovers,	2022.0	4.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	these lower share prices will prove to have  been potentially great buying opportunities.	2026.86	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:34:04] I think this will also be a really  big test for Andy Jassy as he’s facing a lot	2032.32	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	of pressure in terms of the overall economy  and inflation, but I think there’s a lot of	2037.42	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	options for him and levers he can pull,  such as the trimming the employee count,	2042.4	3.96
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	or increasing their prices a little bit, or  just tweaking some of their business segments.	2046.36	4.29
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:34:22] I think there’s so much optionality  in so many levers that management can pull to,	2050.65	4.71
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	you know, achieve that long term profit.  Lastly regarding Alphabet and Amazon,	2055.36	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	I wouldn’t be surprised at all if  either of these two companies have	2060.04	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	really depressed earnings in 2023 and  it pushes their stock prices even lower.	2064.48	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:34:41] The emphasis for me is on  the really long term and the secular	2069.22	3.84
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	trends that will benefit these companies.  When looking at Alphabet, for example,	2073.06	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and what looks like a relatively low PE today,  we need to consider that those earnings in the	2077.8	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	future may decline. We may see lower earnings  in 2023, so the stock might look cheap today.	2083.26	5.64
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:35:00] So I guess that’s my way of saying  to be prepared for a potentially bumpy ride	2088.9	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	with these two companies. As the market  is a voting machine in the short run and	2093.4	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	a weighing machine in the long. Transitioning  to the third company I wanted to talk about	2097.84	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	in today’s episode. This is a new one I haven’t  done into prior to researching for this episode.	2102.82	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:35:20] It’s a company called S&P  Global, ticker, SPGI Value Stock Geek,	2108.52	7.2
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which is one of my very favorite blogs for company  deep dives did a pretty detailed article on this	2115.72	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	company. So shout out to him for his great  writeup on his blog called Security Analysis.	2120.7	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:35:37] Plus my colleague Shawn O’Malley,  who’s our newsletter writer at TIP, used to	2125.5	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	work at this company, so I was able to get some  interesting insights from him as well. Shawn is	2131.08	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	doing great work on TIP’s daily newsletter  called We Study Markets. If you’re not yet	2136.18	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	subscribed for that, you can do so by going  to theinvestorspodcast.com/westudymarkets.	2141.1	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:35:59] Now S&P Global describes themselves as	2146.08	5.64
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the leading provider of transparent  and independent ratings, benchmarks,	2151.72	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	analytics, and data to the capital  and commodity markets worldwide.	2156.52	4.32
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:36:12] Their claim to fame is their  creation of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones	2160.84	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Industrial Average Indexes, and they’re also  one of the three major corporate credit rating	2166.0	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	agencies along with Moody’s and Fitch. So  they operate in an oligopoly in this market,	2171.28	6.06
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which provides them with one of the  most powerful moats in the world.	2177.34	3.78
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:36:33] Many of our listeners may be aware  that Buffett has roughly a 6 billion position in	2181.12	6.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Moody’s and has owned the company since the year  2000. Any corporation that wants to issue debt,	2187.12	6.48
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which is practically every company, they’re going  to need to get a credit rating in order to do.	2193.6	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:36:50] SPGI is also a data company, as in  2020, they acquired a company called IHS Market.	2198.76	8.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:36:58] IHS Market has various products that  provide things such as economic forecasting data,	2206.92	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	financial data for securities and derivatives,  data and analytics for the energy market and	2212.68	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	various other niche data. So from a high level,  SPGI has four major business segment. First is the	2218.26	7.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	ratings business. This is the supplier of credit  ratings on corporations and sovereign governments.	2226.12	5.34
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:37:23] The blog post from security  analysis states that the data collected	2231.46	4.32
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	from this segment supplies the market  intelligence. Business ratings are the	2235.78	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	most cyclical segment of the company as  it depends on new deals and debt issuance,	2240.52	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which we’ll pick up when the economy is hot.  Ratings represent nearly 57% of operating profit.	2245.32	7.2
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:37:44] The second segment is their  indices business as they’re the index	2252.52	4.02
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	provider for indexes like the S&P  500. When a company like iShares,	2256.54	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Vanguard or BlackRock wants to create  a product based on the S&P index,	2261.76	3.84
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	they have to pay SPGI a fee. This segment  represents 17% of operating profits.	2265.6	7.02
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Third is their market intelligence segment that  represents subscription software that supplies	2273.16	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	data to investment professionals, government  agencies, corporations, and universities.	2278.32	4.56
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:38:14] So this brings that recurring  revenue in for providing an essential	2282.88	3.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	product for financial professionals.  This is 15% of operating profits,	2286.6	4.32
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and fourth is what’s called their Platt  segment. This is a data provider of information	2290.92	5.34
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and benchmark prices for commodity and energy  markets. So what S&P is to the equity markets?	2296.26	6.66
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:38:34] Platts is to the commodity markets.  This is 11% of operating profits. 39% of the	2302.92	6.9
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	company’s revenues are subscription based,  and they’re very sticky due to the nature of	2309.82	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	their agreements, and they’re high switching  costs as well. The index business is also a	2314.44	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	very sticky business because if a company  like BlackRock creates an S&P 500 index,	2319.66	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	it’s not like they can easily shut  that down and stop paying SPGI	2324.58	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	their fees, and this helps provide  entrenchment in the company’s moat.	2329.2	3.9
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:39:05] SPGI is priced as if it’s a great  company. Their PE ratio is around 30 and their EV	2333.1	7.02
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	to EBIT is around 24, which is a metric that got  as low as six during the great financial crisis,	2340.12	6.24
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which was quite an extreme event for  the company. Like many other companies,	2346.36	3.9
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	they’ve outperformed the market over the  past 10 years as shares of averaged 22%	2350.26	5.34
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	annual growth over the past decade  versus just 12% for the S&P 500.	2355.6	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:39:32] Even since the mid 1980s,  it’s been a really strong outperformer	2360.52	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	as they’ve continued to deliver strong  growth in their e p s and their free cash	2365.32	4.32
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	flow per share. The company went through  some structural changes back in 2016,	2369.64	5.04
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and ever since they’ve seen considerable  improvements in their operating margins.	2374.68	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:39:50] Prior to 2016, operating  margins were around 30%, and now	2379.42	4.2
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	operating margins are around 50%. Their  returns on capital are also outstanding,	2383.62	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	averaging north of 20%, and the company  also has a really good management team.	2388.9	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	They’ve recently acquired Market,  which helped expand their moat,	2393.7	3.84
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and they’ve rebranded the company over the  previous decade from McGraw Hill to S&P Global.	2397.54	5.04
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:40:14] The fundamentals have improved  substantially over the past few years as	2402.58	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	revenues have grown by over 50% since 2019,  and operating income has increased by 64%. I	2407.38	8.34
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	think that if we see poor economic conditions  in 2023, then the somewhat cyclicality of S	2415.72	6.78
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	P G’s business will likely come to haunt them  like it did during the great financial crisis.	2422.5	4.77
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:40:38] But the business itself won’t be  going anywhere. So we could see some great	2427.27	5.13
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	buying opportunities in this company if we do  end up seeing, , rough recess. To be honest,	2432.4	5.82
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	I don’t love the valuation at these prices,  but it’s definitely one of the strongest	2438.22	4.26
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	moats for a large cap public company. I could  really find the returns on capital are really,	2442.48	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	really good, but if you see their  earnings multiple mean revert,	2447.7	3.66
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	you could see a 30 to 50% markdown in  the shares to the 180 to $260 range.	2451.36	7.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:41:09] At their current level of earnings.  So this company is more so one to add to my watch	2458.44	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	list to keep an eye on if we do end up seeing  a recession in a sharp drawdown in the stock	2463.06	4.38
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	price. Other than the price, it really checks  all the boxes for me from a value investor’s	2467.44	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	perspective. All right, so transitioning  to the fourth and final wide mo company,	2472.6	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	I wanted to discuss during this episode, it  was somewhat hard to just pick one company.	2477.1	4.38
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:41:32] There are a number of companies I’ve  talked about in the past that would probably	2481.48	3.48
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	be what I call honorable mentions,  such as Dollar General Home Depot,	2484.96	4.2
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Adobe. Or there are companies that are frankly  pretty expensive on a multiple basis like Costco,	2489.16	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	visa, MasterCard, and some of the other big  tech companies like Apple and Microsoft.	2494.86	4.41
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:41:50] But that’s the trouble with these  great companies is that for a lot of the	2499.27	3.69
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	companies lifetime, they’re gonna be trading  at what looks to be pretty expensive prices.	2502.96	4.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Now let’s talk about a company that is likely  impossible to be disrupted by technology,	2507.82	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and that is Sherwin William. Another special  shout out to my friend Adam Zeel for touching	2512.92	6.24
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	on Sherwin Williams in his book, and it  really piqued my interest in the company.	2519.16	3.84
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:42:14] Sherwin Williams started all the  way back in 1866 and it’s widely known for	2523.0	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	manufacturing, paint and paint products. Today  they have about 4,800 locations in the us,	2528.94	6.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbeans.  Their business is primarily driven by three	2535.48	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	main segments, consumer brands at  the AmericaS&Performance coatings.	2541.0	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:42:36] The consumer brands is what is sold  to retail stores like Lowe’s. The Americas is	2545.62	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	what is sold in their own Sherwin-Williams  locations, which drives over 50% of their	2551.14	4.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	revenue. And then the performance coatings  are there. Industrial customers such as	2556.0	4.38
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	automotive companies and floor manufacturers, the  company is somewhat tied to the housing market.	2560.38	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:42:57] People do home improvements.  They may be redoing their pain job and their	2565.9	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	home. Of course, looking back at their  history, revenues did decline in 2009,	2570.34	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	but quickly rebounded in the years that followed  the company continued to produce positive net	2575.08	5.82
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	income throughout the great financial  crisis as well. Over the past 10 years,	2580.9	4.14
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	this boring, stable business has produced  average annual returns of 16% annually,	2585.04	5.7
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	not including the small dividend that they’ve been  paying out, which right now is about a 1% yield.	2590.74	5.64
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:43:27] Sherwin Williams has a pretty  strong moat for a number of reasons I think.	2596.38	3.96
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	For the foreseeable future, we’re gonna always  need paint. New houses are always being built.	2600.88	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	People are always doing updates on their houses. I  think that their consistent operating margins show	2606.46	5.4
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	that they’re able to continually increase prices  over time without being disrupted by competitors.	2611.86	4.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:43:48] They’ve built out these really  strong relationships with contractors,	2616.72	3.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and they’re able to either deliver  products to them in a timely manner,	2620.44	3.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	or have them pick up the products at somewhere  like a Lowe’s or in their own Sherwin-Williams	2623.98	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	store. Because a lot of these contractors  value speed in getting the job done quickly.	2628.9	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:44:05] Sherwin-Williams is able  to deliver fast delivery to customers	2634.66	3.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	better than anyone else because they have the  largest distribution network of stores in the	2638.38	4.56
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	us similar to S B G I. Sherwin-Williams is a  quality company trading at a premium price.	2642.94	6.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	The EV to ebis is around 27, which got  all the way up to 36 at the end of 2020.	2649.48	6.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:44:27] And it’s now trading more in line  with where it was in 2017 prior to then it	2655.48	6.3
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	could be purchased at a multiple in the  low teens. So I’d say that the market	2661.78	3.54
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	has definitely recognized the quality of  this company. Sherwin-Williams has three	2665.32	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	things I really like to see in a company.  On top of their return on invested capital,	2670.3	4.26
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	being in the mid-teens, they’re continually  growing their earnings year after year.	2674.56	4.26
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:44:50] They’re repurchasing  shares at around one to 3% per year,	2678.82	3.6
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and they’re steadily increasing their dividend.  Which is a really strong indication that the	2682.42	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	management team is looking out for the best  interest of their shareholders. I think that	2687.7	4.38
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	investors will do just fine buying at  this price, but more cautious investors	2692.08	4.02
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	may put it on their watch list and see if the  multiple drops from the mid twenties to below	2696.1	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the twenties to the mid-teens, which is where  it’s been for a good amount of its history.	2701.2	4.2
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:45:17] It’s more so what Buffett would call a  wonderful company at a fair price than something	2705.4	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	that happens to be trading at a wonderful  price as well. Let’s remember that alphabet,	2710.14	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which I talked about earlier,  is trading at a multiple of 14	2714.76	3.06
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	to 15 before factoring in any stock-based  compensation. Also for Sherwin Williams.	2717.82	5.628
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:45:34] I wanted to read another excerpt from  Adam Diesel’s book because I just really enjoyed	2723.448	5.472
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	this book and he has so many good pieces in it.  All my non-tech companies are largely tech proof,	2728.92	5.82
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	but none is more so than Sherwin Williams.  You just can’t render paint digitally,	2734.74	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	at least not. Meanwhile, there’s something  deep within human beings that drives them to	2739.84	5.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	coat their walls either for decoration  or to protect against the weather.	2745.72	4.26
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:46:01] In 1866, Henry Sherwin and  Edward Williams founded the company	2749.98	5.04
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	that would introduce the world’s first  guaranteed ready to use paint. As the	2755.02	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	industrial age progressed, paint became  coatings and was used to finish anything	2760.24	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	that needed protection from the elements  such as automobiles, ships, and airplanes.	2765.22	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:46:21] Sherwin Williams developed many  of these modern finisheS&Patented them,	2770.44	4.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	then kept investing money into research and  development to deepen its product mo to make	2775.3	6.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the Sherwin-Williams brand instantly recognizable.  It also kept spending on marketing. Today, Sherwin	2781.3	6.3
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Williams has competitive advantages that stem  from 150 years of innovation and brand loyalty.	2787.6	6.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:46:45] But what really distinguishes the  company is its incredible retail presence.	2794.32	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Sherwin Williams operates a network of nearly	2799.9	2.88
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	5,000 company owned stores, and its  nearest competitor PPG operates roughly	2803.62	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	1000 stores. Why does this network of owned  stores give Sherwin an edge? Because only	2809.26	6.0
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Sherwin Williams has a store base extensive  enough to touch American painters every day.	2815.26	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:47:11] Like many gray businesses,  Sherwin Williams created its moat by	2820.48	4.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	asking what does my customer care about?  And then working backwards until computers	2824.56	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	learn about how to cope buildings, the  economics of house painting will remain	2829.78	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	simple. 80% of a painter’s expenses are  labor and 20% is paint Time is therefore	2834.22	7.56
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	money to a painter and Sherman Williams  focused on that fact like a laser beam.	2841.78	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:47:37] Given these unit economics, wouldn’t  painters reward the company that saved them time?	2846.4	5.34
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	If so, why not roll out so many stores that  most would drive by them every day on the	2851.74	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	way to their job? , that’s what Sherwin  Williams has done. They even offer free	2857.68	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	curbside pickups so the painters don’t have to  get out of their trucks in free donuts as well.	2862.66	4.86
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:47:58] The company supplements  this network with a fleet of 3000	2867.52	3.96
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	trucks whose drivers make constant runs  to job sites to replenish low supplies.	2871.48	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	PPG owns their stores, but roughly one  fifth, the number of Sherwin Williams PPG	2876.64	6.6
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	doesn’t have the density required to make  the network ubiquitous. Benjamin Moore has	2883.24	5.4
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	more contact points because only Sherwin  Williams can handle national accounts,	2888.64	4.98
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and only Sherwin Williams can roll out a new and  improved finish in a consistent nationwide brand.	2893.62	6.36
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:48:31] Only Sherwin Williams has  a mobile app that allows a painter to	2899.98	4.44
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	order 10 gallons of eggshell white in the  evening, then show up at his local store	2904.42	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	the next morning and find it ready for him.  Sherwin’s store network gives in an edge,	2909.1	5.28
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and this edge is continuing to grow. Every year.  Sherwin adds nearly 100 new company owned stores.	2914.38	7.14
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:48:53] PPGs annual new store count  barely reaches double digits. Little wonder	2921.52	5.64
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	that Sherwin Williams is growing its North  American paint sales at six to 7% per year	2927.16	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	twice the rate of the competition. Meanwhile,  Sherwin Williams has a low share of a large and	2932.26	6.36
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	growing market. The worldwide painting  and coating sector remains fragmented.	2938.62	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:49:14] Insure wind only has about 10%  of it at nearly 150 billion in annual. The	2943.36	6.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	market is huge and growing slightly more  than the worldwide economy. Management is	2950.08	5.58
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	also excellent. Unlike Bezos at  Amazon or Murphy at Cap Cities,	2955.66	4.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	there is no single star executive There  is, however, a culture at Sherwin-Williams	2959.74	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	that enunciates an every employee from  the lowest store trainee to the C E O.	2965.26	5.76
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:49:42] The discipline of thinking  like an owner, Unlike many companies,	2971.02	4.08
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Sherwin doesn’t just leave it to the CFO to  understand principles like return on capital	2975.1	4.8
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and capital allocation. You can tell this is not  only from how executives talk, but how they act.	2979.9	6.3
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Sherwin Williams rarely buys companies,  but when they do, they do it brilliantly.	2986.2	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:50:02] In 2017, they bought Valspar, a leading  industrial coating company using a hundred percent	2990.94	6.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	debt financ. Like Tom Murphy at Cap Cities, the  reasoned that they didn’t need to use stock.	2997.66	6.24
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Instead, they could use Sherwin-Williams  ample cash flow to pay down the debt over	3003.9	4.74
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	several years. Then enjoy the acquisition  forever without any dilution to shareholders.	3008.64	5.4
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:50:25] Unlike other less disciplined  businesses, Sherwin Williams articulates	3014.04	5.16
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	clear priorities for its cash flow  and then sticks to them if reinvest	3019.2	4.68
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	money in it, store, network, and product  development. And in the Sherwin brand,	3023.88	4.26
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	anything leftover goes back to shareholders  either as dividends or share purchases.	3028.14	5.04
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:50:44] So as you can tell, Zeel has  so much respect for Sherwin Williams as a	3033.18	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	brand and their business fundamental.  And I also discovered back in 2018,	3037.8	3.78
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	Lowe’s announced that they would be the only  nationwide home center outside of Sherwin Williams	3041.58	6.72
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	owned store. Now Lowe’s and Home Depot are in  a race to partner with the very best brands,	3048.3	5.94
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	and this partnership Lowe’s, established  with Sherwin Williams not only shows how	3054.24	4.5
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	strong of a brand Sherwin Williams  has, but also helps widen their mow.	3058.74	3.96
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:51:13] As anyone who shops at  Lowe’s and wants to purchase paint,	3062.7	3.42
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	they have no other choice than to buy  from Sherwin Williams. If that’s not a mo,	3066.12	4.14
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	I don’t know what. A Lowe’s executive  stated that we do a tremendous amount	3070.26	4.92
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	of research related to customer preferences,  and through that analysis we draw insights,	3075.18	5.46
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	which has led us to some of the most important  brands in Sherwin, William being one of those.	3080.64	5.52
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:51:37] Although the partnership with  Lowe’s is great news, the company earned 75%	3086.16	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	of its profit from the Americas group, which  is essentially its own stores, and they	3091.38	5.22
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	completely dominate the US with 50% market. Their  competitive advantage in this division is their	3096.6	6.3
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	vertical integration within their operations and  their stores being so close to their customers.	3102.9	5.1
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	[00:51:59] So again, Sherwin-Williams, it’s a  great company, likely trading at a fairly high	3108.0	4.62
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	multiple, but it’s come back a little bit  in 2022 and 2023 here. So I think it’s one	3112.62	5.82
qplGxmus2fM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplGxmus2fM	for considering if you’re really looking for  companies with really, really strong moats.	3118.44	4.26

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	is telling us otherwise so I listen to	288.36	5.399
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the market I don't listen to assumptions	291.24	5.519
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	from newbies I don't listen to patterns	293.759	5.16
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	that have worked for me years in the	296.759	5.101
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	past or months in the past for whatever	298.919	7.261
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	reason day twos are not working on otcs	301.86	7.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	that said what is working is dip buys	306.18	4.739
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	and this is the beauty of trading this	309.36	3.779
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	is the beauty of preparation	310.919	3.961
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um a lot of people get depressed when	313.139	4.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	their exact formulas like their go-to	314.88	4.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	patterns don't work I don't get	317.639	4.801
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	depressed I adapt I recognize sometimes	319.44	6.479
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a play or a pattern might not be ideal	322.44	5.16
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	or optimal	325.919	5.101
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um in any given Market but therein	327.6	5.52
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	creates new opportunity because a lot of	331.02	5.1
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	people don't adapt a lot of people	333.12	5.7
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um do buy these stocks on you know the	336.12	5.34
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	first Green Day like into the close and	338.82	4.379
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	then they're surprised when they open	341.46	4.019
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	down and then they panic and then they	343.199	5.901
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	create Good Dip buying opportunities so	345.479	6.181
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	fagi today I know it doesn't look like	349.1	4.78
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it had down traded most of the day but	351.66	5.099
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	in the morning you know it it dropped	353.88	5.759
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	basically you know 15 20 percent and	356.759	7.201
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	then it bounced 15 20 25	359.639	6.601
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um and I bought the bounce and I made	363.96	4.92
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	nearly a thousand bucks I laid this play	366.24	4.88
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	out in my watch list	368.88	5.52
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	pre-market how did I know you never know	371.12	5.919
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a hundred percent but guess what it's	374.4	5.46
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the same pattern that CL Envy which was	377.039	4.981
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a big first Green Day winner earlier	379.86	3.779
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	this week	382.02	2.88
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um	383.639	4.921
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	or is it right here uh this was the	384.9	6.0
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	first Green Day and I mean it looks like	388.56	4.859
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it it went up on day two but it really	390.9	5.88
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	didn't it closed here uh right just	393.419	6.84
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	under 11 it gapped down to 10-5 and did	396.78	7.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a morning Panic to 9-5 before spiking to	400.259	6.481
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	12. this doesn't look like much on a	404.34	5.16
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	chart but this is a 25 morning Spike and	406.74	5.28
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	then it did the same thing today too so	409.5	5.18
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	you know you see this little Panic here	412.02	6.36
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	uh from 10-5 down to like literally nine	414.68	5.98
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	six in like five minutes and then	418.38	5.34
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	straight up same thing today from the	420.66	6.479
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	high tens to the nines and then this	423.72	5.819
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	actually went even higher to the 12s so	427.139	6.9
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I'm looking for these panics f-a-g-i not	429.539	7.681
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a good downtrend on the whole day but a	434.039	4.801
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	perfect little morning panic and a	437.22	5.52
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	little 20-25 bounce the only reason why	438.84	5.699
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I made nearly a thousand on that is	442.74	6.12
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	because as I was prepared because of Cl	444.539	7.261
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	Envy because I see what patterns are	448.86	6.3

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	mystery here where people think it's a	462.479	4.381
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	an exact science	464.52	5.459
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um you know it's just not and you have	466.86	5.22
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	to adapt I'll give you a real world	469.979	3.541
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	analogy	472.08	3.54
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um you know this latest trip I've been	473.52	5.04
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	in Bali in Japan and you know it's	475.62	5.28
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	winter time right now but Japan every	478.56	4.979
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	March or April has Sakura season the	480.9	4.859
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	cherry blossoms is beautiful I highly	483.539	3.901
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	encourage you go	485.759	4.681
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um once upon a time I used to plan my	487.44	4.979
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	Japan trips in like December January	490.44	4.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	February like ahead of time and I would	492.419	4.321
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	look at like the Sakura calendar and I	495.06	3.06
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	would say okay this is the week when the	496.74	2.579
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	cherry blossoms are going to be there	498.12	3.359
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the first time I got to Japan and after	499.319	4.021
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	doing this I was like I'm ready I'm here	501.479	4.981
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	where the cherry blossoms and you know	503.34	4.859
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the concierge I was staying at the Ritz	506.46	4.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	in Tokyo fantastic hotel and concierge	508.199	4.321
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	kind of looked at me and like laughed	511.02	3.3
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	and he was like the cherry blossoms were	512.52	4.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	last week I didn't think that the cherry	514.32	4.44
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	blossoms calendar	517.02	4.379
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	updates it makes sense it's based on	518.76	4.98
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	whether it's gonna change but I didn't	521.399	4.681
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	think that way the first time second	523.74	4.14
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	time I nailed it and then I was there	526.08	3.12
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	for cherry blossoms and it was beautiful	527.88	3.959
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the stock market is very similar	529.2	5.28
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um why does the first Green Day not work	531.839	6.06
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I don't know I don't care I just adapt	534.48	6.299
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	if a first Green Day doesn't work I know	537.899	4.741
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	that many people are not going to adapt	540.779	3.961
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	they're going to hold overnight then if	542.64	4.139
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it drops a little they're going to panic	544.74	4.86
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	and that creates opportunity like we saw	546.779	5.101
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	in clnv which I missed because I was	549.6	4.739
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	actually flying the other day but fagi I	551.88	5.22
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	just nailed so also if you ever miss a	554.339	5.94
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	play guess what you can get right back	557.1	4.739
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	on the horse that's the beauty of having	560.279	3.481
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a hot market like this where there's so	561.839	4.921
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	many different trading opportunities and	563.76	4.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	you could just practice and you can	566.76	3.18
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	practice with paper trading you can	568.38	3.6
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	practice with small size I wouldn't	569.94	4.86
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	encourage you to practice with bake size	571.98	7.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um also OC EA huge huge shorts squeeze I	574.8	6.84
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	even said this pre-market I said you	579.54	4.859
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	know they were spiking on this seemingly	581.64	5.28
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	positive press release but if you looked	584.399	4.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the press release was the exact same	586.92	5.22
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	press release from September or October	589.019	4.561
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I forget which one I think it was	592.14	5.28
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	October actually did I link it and I'm	593.58	5.759
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	sorry I I didn't uh	597.42	4.38
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I didn't link it properly like I have	599.339	4.68
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	typos I have a new laptop waiting for me	601.8	4.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I just literally haven't set it up	604.019	4.26
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um this was trade zero trade zero had	606.42	4.979
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	shares to short did I not link it I	608.279	4.321
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	don't even know what's going on right	611.399	4.021
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	now I'm so exhausted but you know I	612.6	5.4
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	linked it in chat um it's the same press	615.42	4.8
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	release so some people will say Tim if	618.0	3.839
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it's the same press release why did this	620.22	4.739
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	stock Spike from 4 to 26. this is a	621.839	5.341
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	short squeeze ladies and gentlemen	624.959	4.38
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um I often warn about short selling you	627.18	3.839
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	know I used to be like a big short	629.339	3.06
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	seller	631.019	3.481
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um now I'm pretty much a retired short	632.399	5.221
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	seller but I came out of retirement for	634.5	5.519
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	this one because trade zero had shares	637.62	3.839
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the short this is why I think it's good	640.019	5.161
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	just in case to have a broker that has	641.459	5.761
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	shares available	645.18	4.74
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um you know this was all caused by over	647.22	5.52
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	aggressive shorts when they see the same	649.92	4.44
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	press release and they're like this is	652.74	4.74
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	wrong I apply logic I apply my short	654.36	5.64
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	selling narrow-minded you know pepper	657.48	4.979
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	toxic mentality of this play and they're	660.0	4.86
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	shorting it huge in the five six sevens	662.459	4.32
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	thinking that it deserves to go to the	664.86	4.919
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	fours or even the threes little do they	666.779	5.521
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	know because of their narrow-mindedness	669.779	4.861
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	because of their group think they create	672.3	4.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	this giant squeeze this is very similar	674.64	5.46
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	to a few months ago ilag several of my	676.8	4.92
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	top students who were in these group	680.1	3.299
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	think chat rooms and they don't like me	681.72	4.44
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	calling them out but I got to	683.399	5.641
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um they lost five six seven figures	686.16	5.22
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	shorting ilag which wasn't even a good	689.04	5.4
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	setup they just were like Chinese pump	691.38	5.399
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	shorted and they all squeezed each other	694.44	4.079
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	out even though eventually it did crash	696.779	4.68
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	same thing with Ocea so you know when	698.519	5.281
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I'm shorting this I only made a few	701.459	4.021
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	hundred dollars okay I didn't nail this	703.8	3.24
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	at all	705.48	4.32
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um you know I I didn't enter at the	707.04	4.919
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	right time I didn't take the size I	709.8	4.2
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	should have this is not a great trade	711.959	5.761
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	but I called it pretty well in chat	714.0	5.16

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um six hours ago	781.079	3.601
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	from the time I'm filming this I said	783.06	3.24
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	you know shorting is too crowded when	784.68	3.659

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	yesterday and now OCA up on old news	788.339	4.141
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	both will crash since they're up for the	790.68	3.42
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	wrong reasons but pray for the over	792.48	4.68
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	aggressive as they know not the risks	794.1	5.88
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	they take until it's too late	797.16	5.82
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um Sirius ilag Vibes and in case you	799.98	5.7
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	didn't know like this was at 9 42 a.m	802.98	5.7
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	Eastern I said both will crash let's see	805.68	7.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	what lunar did today 9 42 a.m Eastern is	808.68	6.42
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	where was it	813.3	4.039
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	uh like right here	815.1	7.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	uh 9 42 right here lunr was at 77. it	817.339	8.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	finished the day at 21. okay it crashed	822.72	6.96
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	73 but yesterday it had a giant squeeze	825.959	8.461
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	yesterday it spiked from 35 to 135. this	829.68	5.52
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	is	834.42	4.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	over crowded Short Selling not because	835.2	6.36
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	lunr is a good example or a good company	838.92	4.2
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	you can see here it's actually a great	841.56	4.2
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	example of a short squeeze in a crash	843.12	7.08
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um so I said both lunr and OCA are going	845.76	9.12
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	to crash Ocea this was at 9 42 A.M	850.2	8.4
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	this was when the stock was right here	854.88	5.42
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it was like 10ish so I actually	858.6	5.039
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	underestimated how high Ocea would go	860.3	6.46
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	but I was dead on right with lunr and	863.639	7.021
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	again Ocea you know I I shorted it I had	866.76	5.579
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	some small profits but I should have	870.66	3.299
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	been more patient	872.339	4.081
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um this has been my problem lately where	873.959	5.281
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	you know I'm just not being aggressive	876.42	4.74
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	enough and I get it like short selling	879.24	4.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	is extra risky I don't want to be more	881.16	4.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	aggressive than this you know just even	883.8	3.96
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	taking a position I was just happy that	885.66	4.44
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	trade zero had shares to short	887.76	3.96
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um but	890.1	3.66
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I I shouldn't have covered all right	891.72	3.9
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	away you know this is also partially	893.76	5.22

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	how exhausted I am	907.98	4.02
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	just I don't know put some put some	909.959	3.721
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	little cartoon eyes or something I'm	912.0	4.019
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	freaking exhausted man	913.68	5.099
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um so that was my own you know personal	916.019	4.44
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	issues and sometimes you're gonna have	918.779	3.18
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	personal issues whether it's your work	920.459	3.12
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	whether it's your family whether you're	921.959	3.481
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	trading from different time zones every	923.579	4.2
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	few hours or days	925.44	5.639
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um anyways profit because I adapted on	927.779	6.901
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	fagi and because you know I saw OCA and	931.079	5.041
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I had the right broker that had shares	934.68	2.279
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the short	936.12	2.7
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um this was probably my best trade of	936.959	4.021
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the day though it's not my biggest it's	938.82	4.319
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I think it's actually my smallest dollar	940.98	4.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	gain it's my smallest percent gain but	943.139	5.341

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	up uh from basically 40 to 50 cents	952.38	4.319
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	Richard Branson tweeted about them	954.899	3.541
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	stocks and trade breaking news alerted	956.699	4.38
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	me and everybody else you should use	958.44	3.959
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	stocks and trade breaking news I	961.079	3.661
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	wouldn't trade without it anyways spiked	962.399	5.641
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	from 40 to 50 and then I saw it here on	964.74	6.3
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	this little dip here in the 44 is 45s	968.04	6.08
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	and I got a really good entry here	971.04	6.72
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	on that dip on that like 10 drop off the	974.12	6.1
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	highs I don't want to chase anything in	977.76	4.259
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	this market you know Richard Branson	980.22	3.299
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	tweeting about this company that's good	982.019	3.901
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	but at the same time like you know it's	983.519	4.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	not like oh my God this is this is going	985.92	3.9
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	to be a Fortune 500 company now because	988.019	3.661
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	Richard Branson tweeted about it it's	989.82	3.78
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	just a momentum play	991.68	3.899
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um but I said you know I'd love to see	993.6	4.44
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it close strong as speculative plays	995.579	4.921
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	like this are running and you know I was	998.04	6.18
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	in at 45 uh it bounced right in here but	1000.5	6.06
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it was a little choppy and I sold before	1004.22	4.26
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it actually you know broke out to new	1006.56	3.6
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	highs and now after hours it's up a	1008.48	5.099
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	little too so I underestimated this play	1010.16	6.239
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um you know I don't mind underestimating	1013.579	4.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it because I'm I really just had a	1016.399	3.541
