8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	Friends, in this video for ithought advisory, I am going to talk to you on the topic	0.599	3.961
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	'The Problem is NOT Fees'. Most people	4.56	5.34
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	have developed a  mindset of worrying more about fees than about performance	9.9	9.24
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	people believe that if there is performance then there is a	19.14	4.32
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	justification to pay fees what happens because of this mindset is	23.46	7.68
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	that when there is no performance	31.14	4.099
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	investors develop a reluctance to invest because they are worried that investing	35.239	8.741
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	when there is no performance would lead to more fees	43.98	4.98
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	actually investing when performance is modest	48.96	4.56
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	for whatever reasons leads to better returns and eventually	53.52	6.359
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	provides a justification for paying fees	59.879	4.081
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	there is no denying that there has to be accountability towards paying fees.	63.96	7.199
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	But in an advisory equation accountability is a two-way traffic	71.159	7.5
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	I am sure many people would not like what I am saying but I am saying this	78.659	5.161
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	from my experience when an investor is not performing that	83.82	6.299
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	well in his portfolio largely due to the overall market context	90.119	5.701
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	he has to focus on what he needs to do in his portfolio bringing about	95.82	5.88
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	investment actions should be as much his priority as it is	101.7	6.66
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	the advisor's responsibility. But what I have seen is that with	108.36	4.799
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	advisor tries to fulfill his responsibility and tells the investor	113.159	4.561
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	evaluations are down let's put another five or ten percent or let's invest	117.72	3.84
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	regularly into these parts of the market when the market goes up things will	121.56	3.96
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	become all right the investor goes into inaction he goes into freeze mode	125.52	6.56
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	and often he does not prioritize what he must do	132.08	7.06
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	then the market eventually goes up, right and he has completely missed the window	139.14	4.92
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	of opportunity and that further makes him	144.06	5.16
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	all the more indifferent	149.22	3.06
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	and upset that he has not participated. Now think about it if the investor	152.28	5.76
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	advisor engagement understood that the advisor is doing his	158.04	5.82
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	responsibility the investor did what is his priority the two would have come	163.86	3.659
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	together to get what the investor wanted and to create an outcome which	167.519	5.281
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	comfortably will justify fees. Clearly	172.8	4.62
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	in multiple instances where an investor fails to get what he expects	177.42	6.72
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	one sees that there is a clear	184.14	4.379
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	gap or understanding which is lacking. This Gap	188.519	5.64
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	has to be filled obviously the advisor is also responsible	194.159	3.66
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	he is as responsible as the investor is but the investor is	197.819	6.42
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	the one who has to take primary responsibility it is his money he has to	204.239	4.86
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	get the return he can't externalize the whole	209.099	3.72
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	responsibility to the advisor. There is another problem where investors	212.819	5.34
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	don't act in time they delay they say they are busy the	218.159	5.521
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	work life is hectic when they find they will	223.68	4.02
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	fulfill the investment actions as adviced	227.7	2.94
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	now this comes at a cost which you fail to act in time then you	230.64	5.7
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	act late and you may act at a valuation where	236.34	3.72
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	prices are moved evaluation has moved up or down when you sell	240.06	4.92
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	these come at a very heavy cost and all these things boil down to one simple point that	244.98	6.238
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	there is a investor priority and an advisor responsibility	251.22	4.919
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	investor must prioritize is investing over his other responsibilities	256.139	6.181
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	and advisor must take responsibility and give priority to every investor	262.32	4.8
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	especially when the investor's portfolio is in a bit of rough	267.12	5.1
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	because you have to pull it up by making him do a few things right when markets	272.22	4.8
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	are down or when his portfolio is down or when both are down which is usually	277.02	3.42
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	the case that in turn will bring everyone to a	280.44	3.9
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	better place. The problem clearly is not fees the problem is this collaborative	284.34	4.98
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	culture which is lacking in our country largely because the advisory universe or	289.32	6.06
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	the ecosystem is at a very early stage it lacks the kind of maturity and	295.38	5.94
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	understanding which can bring it the desired	301.32	3.12
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	efficiency because Indian investors have a very high Benchmark of what efficiency	304.44	4.199
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	they want but not prioritizing on what they need	308.639	3.661
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	they need to do and the advisor is also failing to communicate to the	312.3	3.899
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	investors about what he should do because you're	316.199	3.121
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	worried that the investor go away if you tell the truth. So	319.32	4.2
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	the truth is not discussed everything is hanging in thin air	323.52	4.14
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	and a lot of people end up being not as happy as they want to be which	327.66	6.06
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	effectively leads to a failure of our	333.72	4.62
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	eventual objective which is to serve the investors.	338.34	2.94
8NjLE7zraLM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NjLE7zraLM	Thank you for watching this video!	341.28	3.139
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	today we're going to be answering the question can  you take the risk in retirement most of the time	0.36	6.36
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	I find that you've been saving in maybe low-cost  index funds or equities for the majority of your	6.72	6.78
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	savings life your accumulation years trying  to accumulate as much as you can at the lowest	13.5	4.86
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	cost and the biggest return which means quite  often we find that most retirees are taking on	18.36	4.98
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	the risk of the market and then as you transition  into retirement you start asking can I still take	23.34	6.0
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	this level of risk can I handle the ups and downs  of the markets well today I'm going to give you a	29.34	5.04
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	simple acronym for you to better understand  the level of risk you can take in retirement	34.38	6.42
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	so we're going to start that with the letter C and  C stands for capacity do you have the capacity to	40.8	9.42
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	take on risk and retirement one being let's say  you saved a million dollars for retirement and	50.22	6.12
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	you want to spend a hundred thousand dollars a  year in retirement of that million dollars that's	56.34	5.46
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	a 10 withdrawal rate it's a hundred thousand  dollars a year now during your working years	61.8	4.98
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	taking on that level of risk when the million  might go to 500 000 you didn't really worry about	67.5	5.58
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	it because you didn't need to take a withdrawal  from those dollars now in retirement if you're	73.08	4.62
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	taking on the level of risk of the market  we know what can happen in 2008 during the	77.7	4.5
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	financial crisis your million would have turned  into about a half a million dollars now if that	82.2	4.74
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	happens in retirement now your million turns  into a half a million and you take a hundred	86.94	4.92
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	thousand dollar withdrawal now you have four  hundred thousand dollars it's going to take more	91.86	4.98
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	than a hundred percent return for you to ever  recover from those losses so you're clearly in	96.84	4.68
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	a situation that you do not have the capacity  for the risk now let's take that same million	101.52	7.32
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	dollar scenario and say that you're going to  spend forty thousand dollars a year spending	108.84	4.86
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	forty thousand dollars a year from that million  dollars in conjunction with Social Security maybe	113.7	5.28
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	pension income more than enough income to last the  rest of your life now you only need to make four	118.98	5.1
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	percent per year in order to Simply preserve  the principle of that million dollars so you	124.08	5.58
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	now have the capacity to take the risk the next  question should be though just because you have	129.66	5.58
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	the capacity or don't doesn't mean you should or  should not take the risk that is do you have the	135.24	5.28
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	attitude to take on that risk when it comes to  attitude that's something very personal to you	140.52	7.14
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	and it can come down to something very simple that  is what would you do if your million turned into	147.66	7.62
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	a half a million dollars the question being  would you panic if you took those kinds of	155.28	5.04
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	losses because Panic is what gets most retirees  in trouble and puts them back to work so we want	160.32	6.9
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	to gauge if you have the attitude to continue  to endure the ups and downs of the stock market	167.22	5.88
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	during your retirement years then we get to need  the n stands for need do you have the need to	173.1	8.22
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	take that level of risk if you have a million  dollars and you're only going to draw 30 40	181.32	5.94
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	000 dollars a year out of that portfolio then you  don't really have the need to take the risk of the	187.26	6.78
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	market you can downshift you can take on less  risk if you have that million dollars and you	194.04	6.12
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	want to draw a hundred thousand dollars a year  from that million well now you need to take the	200.16	5.76
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	risk of the market in order to satisfy all of your  income needs in retirement which puts you in a bit	205.92	7.02
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	of a conundrum if you are in that position where  you need to take the risk you probably don't have	212.94	5.34
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	the capacity to take the risk so it really comes  down to your attitude at that point in time what	218.28	6.12
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	you're looking for here is that you hit two out  of three of these bullet points do you have the	224.4	4.74
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	capacity okay I have the capacity do I have the  attitude no I don't have the attitude but I have	229.14	6.24
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	the need in that case you're going to need to  take the risk maybe you find you don't have the	235.38	5.28
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	need to take the risk and you have no capacity to  take that risk but you do have attitude to take	240.66	7.98
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	the risk then you don't take the risk it's as  simple as that spend time taking a look at your	248.64	6.06
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	unique situation and applying the can acronym to  determine how much risk you can take in retirement	254.7	6.18
r0vm_UKCtD0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vm_UKCtD0	foreign	264.06	0.72
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	There are all sorts of risks when it  comes to investing, but most of the time,	0.0	3.84
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	when somebody asks me about managing risks and  their investments, they are really talking about	3.84	5.22
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	volatility. They're wanting to prevent  significant declines in their portfolio.	9.06	4.74
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	Hi! I am Chris Alman and I work with small  business owners and entrepreneurs to take	14.7	4.74
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	the uncertainty out of exiting their  business and retiring comfortably.	19.44	3.36
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	So, how do you limit the chances of seeing  a significant decline in your portfolio?	23.7	4.62
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	Well, if that something that you're  wondering about too, stick around.	28.86	4.56
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	Foreign [Music]	36.72	1.24
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	If you’re like most small business owners,  you probably don't have a lot of experience	44.52	4.5
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	investing in the markets. And, if we are honest,  it's because you can't get the kind of returns,	49.02	5.46
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	that you see from your business  anywhere else. And, not to mention,	54.48	4.02
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	you feel like you have more control over  things. Keep telling yourself that darling. But,	58.5	5.82
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	in the stock market, it feels like  you have no control. [Screaming]	64.32	3.46
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	so, let's take a look at what you can do  to reduce the risk of seeing a significant	70.5	4.2
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	decline in your portfolio. So, first off, when  most people talk about investing in the market,	74.7	6.06
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	they're talking about the S&P 500. And while the  S&P 500 is a large and very well-known market,	80.76	6.36
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	it's just one of many. So, instead of me listing  out everyone of them, we’ll break them down into	87.12	6.0
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	categories called asset classes. So, in the US,  you have large cap, mid cap, small cap. You have	93.12	8.88
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	developed international markets. You've  got emerging markets. Then you have bonds.	102.66	6.0
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	And there are corporate bonds. There are  government bonds. There are municipal bonds.	108.66	5.34
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	Then, you have commodities. You've got real  estate and all sorts of different types of	114.72	4.92
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	alternative investments. You might be wondering  why all of this is important. So, let me ask you	119.64	5.4
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	a question. If you only had one customer for your  business, what would that mean for your success?	125.04	6.06
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	You're my number one customer. What would happen  if that customer decided one day that they were	131.1	5.52
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	unhappy with the results or they found a better  price somewhere else and they decided to leave?	136.62	5.52
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	Well, I can tell you it's not going to look good.  Uh, it's not good. It doesn't look good. And the	142.8	5.58
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	same is true for your portfolio. If you only have  one investment in your portfolio, then it's at a	148.38	7.2
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	significant risk of seeing a decline. If something  happens to that one investment that company could	155.58	5.82
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	go bankrupt or that market could collapse because  of some new technological innovation. Whatever it	161.4	7.68
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	may be, there's a tremendous amount of risk there  in just owning one investment. So, the first step	169.08	4.92
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	is to diversify. And you may not want to own every  single different type of investment or asset class	174.0	5.76
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	that I've mentioned, but you want to consider  what's going to fit well in your portfolio based	179.76	6.36
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	on your values and the goals that you have. So,  some of these investments come with higher risks,	186.12	5.64
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	but they're also typically paired with higher  returns. No pain. No gain. So you really have	191.76	5.58
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	to decide what's going to be best for you. So, the  second step to reducing the risk in your portfolio	197.34	6.48
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	is just to realize that you can't control the  markets, and you’re going to experience downturns.	203.82	6.54
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	And instead of trying to figure out what to buy  at the right time, you have to focus on the fact	211.5	7.62
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	that "time in the market always beats trying to  time the market.” So, prepare for those downturns.	219.12	8.7
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	Know that they are going to come. And instead of  focusing on the day-to-day news and information	227.82	5.88
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	that you hear constantly through the media, focus  on having a long-term perspective just like you	233.7	7.32
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	would in your business. I bet you didn’t start  your business with the thought that you were	241.02	4.02
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	going to start, see a little bit of growth, and  then sell. No, you started your business knowing	245.04	5.94
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	that there was going to be some rough patches,  especially in the early years. You’re going to see	250.98	4.26
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	some great growth. You’re also going to have some  setbacks along the way. Remember that the stock	255.24	4.98
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	markets are full of thousands of other companies  just like yours and their goal, their mission for	260.22	6.48
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	their company, is to serve their clients and their  customers to improve their lives while making	266.7	5.28
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	money at the same time. And, sometimes, they have  to borrow money. Sometimes they have customers	271.98	6.54
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	that get upset. Whatever it may be. They’re going  to have those setbacks just like you do, but at	278.52	5.88
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	the end of the day, you know that your business is  going to do well, and they expect the same thing.	284.4	4.8
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	So, quit looking at the day-to-day stuff. It’s  only going to cause stress. In fact, there was	290.4	4.92
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	some great research done by Richard Thaler, Amos  Tversky, Daniel Kahneman, and Alan Schwartz around	295.32	6.0
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	myopia or nearsightedness and loss aversion. And,  what they concluded was that investors that had	301.32	7.8
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	more frequent feedback on their investments, in  other words, they were watching it all the time,	309.12	5.82
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	they tended to have more poor results. So they  weren't taking as much risk in their portfolio	314.94	6.9
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	because they were feeling that stress, that  anxiety because they were looking at it more	321.84	5.1
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	frequently. So take your focus off of the short  term. Placed it on the long term because if you	326.94	8.1
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	focus on the short term things, it's only going  to lead to heartache. Nothing but a heartache.	335.04	10.5
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	Although there's no magic pill and there's  no special remedy to completely eliminate the	345.54	5.94
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	chance of having a downturn in the market,  if you'll remember that diversifying your	351.48	4.74
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	portfolio and focusing on the long-term, and  just remembering that time in the market always	356.22	6.6
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	outperforms trying to time the market, you're  going to have success. So with that do you have	362.82	7.38
qey2Rf6_3sA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qey2Rf6_3sA	any other questions for me? So, as always,  feel free to reach out! I'd love to hear	370.2	4.92

MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	investing there's likely no place else	152.099	4.021
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	where you're going to get the kind of	154.379	4.5
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	returns you've had with your business	156.12	5.1
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	and don't forget those returns don't	158.879	4.621
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	come without risk each and every day	161.22	4.2
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	being in business you're taking a risk	163.5	3.72
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	and you took a huge risk when you	165.42	3.899
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	decided to start your business	167.22	4.56
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	you risked everything to make sure that	169.319	4.261
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	it was successful and now you're	171.78	4.02
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	enjoying those returns so don't be	173.58	4.439
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	misled	175.8	5.519
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	number two work with the fiduciary so	178.019	5.341
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	there's been a lot of great regulatory	181.319	4.021
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	changes in the last few years that have	183.36	4.64
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	really benefited investors and consumers	185.34	5.58
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	but unfortunately the changes aren't	188.0	5.019
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	perfect and there are still some things	190.92	5.52
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	that aren't quite clear so when it comes	193.019	5.521
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	to the word fiduciary there's a little	196.44	3.78
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	bit of a gray area there	198.54	3.9
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	so let me tell you two phrases that	200.22	4.2
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	you're likely to hear as you start your	202.44	3.9
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	search for a financial advisor or	204.42	5.16
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	financial planner the first one is fee	206.34	5.88
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	based and fee based means that the	209.58	6.299
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	advisor may be paid by the client for	212.22	6.0
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	the advice that they provide but they	215.879	5.401
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	also may sell a product	218.22	6.32
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	and then the second phrase is fee only	221.28	6.3
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	fee only means that the advisor may be	224.54	5.68
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	paid by the client for the advice that	227.58	4.379
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	they give and they receive no other	230.22	5.22
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	outside commissions or compensation from	231.959	5.581
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	any third parties	235.44	4.74
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	so let me tell you why I believe that	237.54	5.759
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	fee only is the better of the two	240.18	5.18
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	so let's say that you need insurance	243.299	4.44
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	life insurance	245.36	4.54
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	and you know that you need it but you're	247.739	5.58
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	not sure how much or what kind so you	249.9	5.52
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	you found an advisor and you found out	253.319	4.26
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	that they're feed based and you go in	255.42	4.439
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	and ask them to help you calculate how	257.579	5.221
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	much Insurance you need and what type	259.859	5.221
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	well the problem with this relationship	262.8	3.72
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	is that	265.08	4.08
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	it's hard to trust the advice	266.52	4.82
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	because you're you're not always certain	269.16	5.819
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	if the advice is leading to the sale of	271.34	5.62
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	a product or if it's really in your best	274.979	4.561
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	interest so they may say that you need a	276.96	5.1
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	universal life product and you need you	279.54	4.26
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	know one million dollars worth of	282.06	4.26
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	coverage but how do you know if that	283.8	5.06
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	product is in your best interest because	286.32	5.34
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	they may be paid more for the universal	288.86	4.839
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	life policy than they would be paid for	291.66	4.259
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	a whole life policy or a term life	293.699	3.901
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	insurance policy	295.919	4.56
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	on the other hand if you went to a fee	297.6	4.8
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	only financial planner you don't have to	300.479	3.78
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	worry about whether the recommendations	302.4	4.2
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	are in your best interest or not because	304.259	4.44
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	the amount of compensation the advisor	306.6	4.5
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	receives doesn't change based on what	308.699	4.5
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	they recommend so if they recommend two	311.1	3.84
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	million dollars of whole life insurance	313.199	4.44
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	versus term insurance it's because it's	314.94	4.68
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	better for you not because they're going	317.639	3.421
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	to get paid more	319.62	3.24
MddGG702LSs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddGG702LSs	so if you're beginning to search for a	321.06	3.18

GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	let's talk about a secret to grow and protect  your portfolio prior to and in retirement and	0.78	6.54
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	I'm not talking about annuities here this is a  subject when the average investor hears about	7.32	5.52
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	it they get this look of confusion and  bewilderment on their face but if you're	12.84	5.04
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	patient it will be the best secret you learn  this year I would venture to Guess that 98 of	17.88	7.2
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	financial advisors avoid this like the plague  and your firm is most likely on that list	25.08	6.18
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	hello again Dave Dooley here sharing great ideas  for you to take into consideration when heading	31.86	5.52

GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	and your family on the right track when taking  advantage of processes you can use to maximize	44.94	5.34
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	wealth and income in retirement today is going to  be no different and this is especially important	50.28	5.76
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	in today's Financial volatile environment that  we're in so take the time to listen carefully	56.04	5.58
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	to the end and let me know if this gives you some  comfort knowing you can protect your portfolio and	61.62	6.66
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	yet grow your portfolio well into the future plus  I've got a free gift for you let's Dive In learn	68.28	8.16
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	to trade options yes you can do it I'm talking  basic strategies that will set you apart from 99	76.44	7.98
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	of the typical investors out there why learn to  trading options it provides leverage it reduces	84.42	7.92
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	risk generates income and lowers cost and it's a  great alternative and if you say Dave I don't want	92.34	7.56
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	to learn then at least be smart enough to use a  firm that has experts to do it let's start with	99.9	6.48
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	some Basics today an option contract is a security  just like a stock it has a bid and an Ask price it	106.38	7.68
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	is a negotiated contract that has strictly defined  terms and conditions stock options provides the	114.06	6.78
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	right not the obligation to buy or sell units of  100 shares of stock at a certain price and by a	120.84	7.44
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	certain date the stock price or exercise price is  the defined definition now remember each option	128.28	7.8
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	is represented by an underlying stock each option  contract is 100 shares so today's let's use apples	136.08	7.98
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	are example and plug-in terms as we go to make  it as simple as we possibly can so there are two	144.06	7.5
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	types of options a call option and a put option  now I can buy a call or sell a call option I can	151.56	7.86
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	buy a put option or sell a put option we and you  should use the most basic options today I will	159.42	8.34
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	focus only on buying a put option and selling a  call option the premise is you and I already own	167.76	6.18
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	the underlying security meaning we are not using  options to sell or buy a stock we already own the	173.94	7.44
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	stock let's start with buying a put option so  you own apple and let's say you currently own	181.38	6.0
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	300 shares apple is currently trading today at 160  dollars a share now you bought it with the idea	187.38	7.14
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	that it will go up in value correct but like your  car insurance your home you own you want to insure	194.52	6.66
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	your investment you want to protect it remember  you may have 15 different stocks worthwhile	201.18	6.18
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	five hundred thousand dollars in your portfolio  you want to protect it right you insure all your	207.36	6.06
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	major assets so in this example with just one  stock you have 300 shares at a hundred and sixty	213.42	7.26
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	dollars or forty eight thousand dollars invested  in one stock though you bought it thinking long	220.68	6.0
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	term you still want to cover your backside  you would then look at how much a put option	226.68	6.36
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	on Apple would cost you would determine how  much of that asset you want to protect let's	233.04	5.94
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	say you decide if Apple goes down to 155 dollars  that's okay meaning you realize stocks do have	238.98	7.02
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	volatility and go up and down but if it got below  150 a share I'd kill myself I'm kidding but your	246.0	8.82
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	wife would kill you so you may need a hundred  and fifty dollar put option and you find out	254.82	6.3
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	that the May 150 Apple put option will cost you  a dollar and fifty cents now what does that mean	261.12	8.76
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	first options expire the third Friday of each  month 99 of the time some options on widely traded	270.42	8.34
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	stocks may have other expert uh expiration dates  but most all on the third Friday of each month uh	278.76	6.72
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	month so today is April 15th and the third Friday  of May is the 19th next month so around 30 to 34	285.48	8.7
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	days from now what I know is I need three put  contracts for May 19th expiration the cost is a	294.18	8.82
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	hundred and fifty dollar or I should say a dollar  fifty times 100 uh shares because remember each	303.0	7.68
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	contract equals 100 shares keep in mind I can  choose to go longer out I could go to June or	310.68	6.78
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	July or August and so on but the longer I go out  the more expensive the option is why time value if	317.46	8.76
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	I insure my car for 30 days it's cheaper than if I  insured it for one year you own 300 shares so you	326.22	7.32
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	need three contracts at a cost of a dollar fifty  times three equals four hundred and fifty dollars	333.54	7.98
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	okay now let's recap let's stop here a minute  you have 300 shares of Apple stock worth forty	341.52	5.88
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	eight thousand dollars you just bought insurance  by purchasing three May one fifty put contracts	347.4	8.64
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	for four hundred and fifty dollars so three things  can happen between today and May 19 34 days from	356.04	7.8
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	now Apple can go up it can go down or it could  stay somewhere where it's at today if Apple goes	363.84	6.84
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	up awesome on May 19th if the stock is trading at  a hundred and seventy dollars a share you're up	370.68	6.18
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	three thousand dollars on Apple now you've got to  subtract the 450 dollars you pay for the insurance	376.86	5.64
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	and you netted twenty five hundred and fifty  dollars on the Other Extreme Apple drops to 130	382.5	7.8
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	dollars prior to May 19th or at expiration date  which uh is 34 days from now obviously you're 48	390.3	8.34
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	000 now is worth 39 000 or a nine thousand dollar  reduction from where you bought it at 160. now	398.64	7.56
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	it's not a loss yet because you still own the  stock but you have a put option at 150. meaning	406.2	7.44
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	you have the right to put it to someone at the  hundred and fifty dollar a share price which is	413.64	6.36
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	exactly what you would do since you bought the put  you have the right to put it at any time hence the	420.0	6.54
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	name put you could have done it once if the stock  got let's say anywhere below 150 let's say 149	426.54	7.86
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	two weeks ago but when you put it that means it's  gone or you sold it at the price of 150 which was	434.4	8.88
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	your put insurance here it was down to a hundred  and thirty dollars a share and you protected 20.	443.28	7.02
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	dollars or six thousand you would have lost had  you not had the put in place so you now buy Apple	450.3	8.04
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	at the 130 dollar price profit and it covers it  again so if the stock stays above 150 the contract	458.34	9.0
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	just expires worthless now let's figure out how to  pay for this put or this insurance that you just	467.34	8.52
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	got to protect the portfolio because to continue  every 30 60 90 days to purchase put options would	475.86	8.82
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	add up and eat into your returns so let's figure  out how to focus on selling a covered call on	484.68	6.84
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	Apple now coverage just means as we said earlier  that I already own the stock which is the only	491.52	6.3
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	way you want to do this so you own Apple at 160  dollars you now protect your downside with a put	497.82	7.2
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	option at a hundred and fifty dollars and you paid  450 dollars for that put or for that right now I'm	505.02	7.86
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	thinking hey if this stock by May 19th goes to a  hundred and eighty dollars a share I'd be willing	512.88	6.72
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	to sell it that means I would look to see if I can  get it least a dollar fifty or a hundred and fifty	519.6	7.26
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	dollars per contract times three or four hundred  and fifty to sell my call in a hundred and eighty	526.86	6.12
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	dollars again May 19th or sooner if the stock  goes above 180 it can get called away from me	532.98	8.28
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	because I've sold that right but they deposit into  my account today the 450 by selling that right now	541.26	8.7
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	remember I paid 450 for the put and the same day  I sold the call for 450. now that's the perfect	549.96	6.3
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	scenario it's break even I've got my position  covered if Apple jumps through 190 or 200 I'm out	556.26	9.24
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	of the 180. I could scream and say I left all that  money on the table or I could look at it and say	565.5	6.42
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	wow I made 11 return in 34 days this particular  option strategy is called a collar at this point	571.92	9.72
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	you may be saying they you lost me a while back  some may say wow why is it my firm doing this	581.64	7.68
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	type of strategy my reply is simple this takes  work and knowledge 99 of advisors won't do it	589.32	8.58
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	because they simply don't want to spend the time  and very few have the working knowledge to do it	597.9	5.28
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	with efficiency the wealthy surround themselves  with experts in this particular area they hedge	603.18	7.14
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	their bets in today's environment like never  before you better cover your backside a simple	610.32	5.88
GTmhEpei5ks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmhEpei5ks	way to do this is either learning the basic of  of options or hire a few dishes that are experts	616.2	7.26

fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	making any investment decisions and to	384.24	4.019
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	seek the advice of a financial	386.699	4.141

fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	thing that I consider the ingredient of	390.84	5.52
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	success in 2023 is buying precious	393.419	5.521
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	metals there are several reasons why	396.36	5.279
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	buying precious metals such as gold and	398.94	5.34
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	silver can be effective precious metals	401.639	4.861
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	have long been considered a store of	404.28	4.5
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	value and a hedge against inflation this	406.5	4.56
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	is because the supply of precious metals	408.78	4.44
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	is relatively stable whereas the supply	411.06	3.9
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	of Fiat currencies such as the US dollar	413.22	3.9
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	can be increased by central banks	414.96	3.78
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	through the process of printing more	417.12	3.78
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	money when the supply money increases	418.74	3.54
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	faster than the supply of goods and	420.9	3.359
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	services it can lead to inflation which	422.28	4.08
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	erodes the purchasing power of that	424.259	4.201
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	currency precious metals on the other	426.36	4.86
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	hand have a finite Supply and are not	428.46	4.26
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	subject to the same level of	431.22	3.599
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	manipulation making them potentially	432.72	5.16
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	more stable store of value this leads to	434.819	4.861
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	the fact that precious metals tend to	437.88	4.14
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	perform well during times of economic	439.68	3.78
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	uncertainty if you look at the	442.02	3.179
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	correlation between gold and the US	443.46	3.66
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	dollar you'll see that when the dollar	445.199	5.4
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	plummets the price of gold skyrockets so	447.12	5.46
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	when investors are worried about the	450.599	3.901
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	stability of the stock market or the	452.58	3.839
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	value of Fiat currencies they may turn	454.5	4.919
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	to Precious Metals as a safe haven asset	456.419	5.041
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	this can lead to an increase in demand	459.419	4.021
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	for precious metals which can drive up	461.46	4.26
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	their prices in fact during times of	463.44	4.8
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	economic recession or financial crisis	465.72	4.919
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	the price of gold has often increased	468.24	4.38
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	for example during the recession of 2008	470.639	4.141
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	the price of gold reached an all-time	472.62	4.919
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	high at the time and later was stopped	474.78	6.12
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	in 2021 almost time happened to Silver	477.539	6.301
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	but the prices of 2008 were not topped	480.9	4.799
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	if you look at precious metals as a	483.84	3.96
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	short time investment buying precious	485.699	4.56
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	metals before the recession and selling	487.8	5.519
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	it on top is also a viable strategy that	490.259	5.401
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	money later can be reinvested when the	493.319	5.22
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	recession stops and prices go down in	495.66	4.379
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	addition to that own in physical	498.539	3.72
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	precious metals such as gold or silver	500.039	5.28
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	coins or bars can offer a level of	502.259	4.681
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	security and privacy that other	505.319	4.081
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	investment vehicles may not provide for	506.94	4.68
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	example if your own physical gold it can	509.4	4.319
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	be stored in a safe place such as a bank	511.62	4.5
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	vault and it is not dependent on the	513.719	4.861
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	stability of any particular financial	516.12	4.859
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	institution or government this can be	518.58	3.959
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	especially important during times of	520.979	3.48
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	economic uncertainty when the stability	522.539	3.961
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	of financial institutions may be in	524.459	4.081
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	question however it is important to know	526.5	4.26
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	that invested in precious metals like	528.54	4.2
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	any investment carries some level of	530.76	3.9
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	risk and should be carefully considered	532.74	4.5
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	as part of a diversified Investment	534.66	5.76
fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	Portfolio 2023 is certainly going to be	537.24	5.58

fc8j_sOQljQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8j_sOQljQ	you should not fight for your money if	549.36	4.2

v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	For bond investors in 2022,	0.033	2.069
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	it felt a little bit like riding  a seesaw with an 800lb gorilla.	2.102	4.237
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	They were never in charge of the ride.	6.873	2.369
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	It was going up and down at a  really fast clip.	9.242	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	In 2022 bonds in the US, the aggregate market,	12.512	3.47
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	dropped the most that  it ever had in history.	16.116	3.169
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And so today we want to talk a little bit about the factors	19.319	3.136
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	that influence bond returns.	22.455	1.702
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	You know, as bond investors, we primarily need to remember that we're lenders.	28.695	3.47
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Whether we're lending to a government or to a company, we are lenders.	32.165	4.204
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And so we expect to be paid back the loan with interest.	36.369	3.504
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	But bonds kind of-- you can look at it and there's several different factors about why	40.44	5.105
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	certain companies or certain governments will pay a higher or lesser interest rate.	45.545	3.604
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And so today we want to look at the factors	49.649	1.735
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	that influence that interest rate and the price of bonds over time.	51.384	3.904
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And like you mentioned in the intro,  Spencer, 2022 was a rough year	55.288	3.27
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	for bond investors and we'll kind of look into that a little bit.	58.558	2.903
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	But if you need a refresher on bond investments,	61.461	2.603
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	you can take a look at our videos: An Overview of Fixed Income and Equity Securities	64.064	3.903
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	or Considerations of Risks When Investing	67.967	2.436
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And we'll link those in the descriptions below.	70.77	1.802
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	But you know, Spencer, when we think about equity investments,	72.572	3.237
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	they have factors and there's a lot of them. Bonds have factors as well.	75.809	3.903
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Today we're just going to consider term, credit quality, and liquidity.	80.046	3.437
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Anything we need to know just as we start off.	83.983	2.203
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	The first thing that we want to address is the inverse relationship	86.686	3.17
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	between bond prices on the one side and interest rates on the other side.	89.856	4.605
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So in 2022, interest rates rose.	94.994	3.104
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And then that seesaw analogy,  bond prices drop.	98.731	2.97
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Now, if we think back over the last number of years,	102.202	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	we've been talking in 2022 about that 800lb gorilla that we didn't have control over	105.505	7.975
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	as bond prices were pushed down in that seesaw effect.	113.48	3.57
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	But really, we've had a gorilla twice the size the last few years,	117.383	4.338
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	a 1600lb gorilla, King Kong of sorts  in the Federal Reserve.	121.721	4.037
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And the Federal Reserve essentially was pushing interest rates down,	126.159	4.404
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	which was pushing bond prices up.	130.563	2.369
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So printing a lot of money.	133.166	2.369
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And so as interest rates dropped again, those bond prices were moving up.	135.535	3.77
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Well, the 1600lb gorilla, King Kong got distracted,	139.305	5.139
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	maybe not even distracted, disinterested, just decided to step off the seesaw.	144.978	3.703
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So the opposite side took over.	148.882	3.169
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And that's what we really saw in 2022.	152.252	2.769
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Right. We had a little example for that.	155.021	1.768
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So we're going to take this hypothetical example of birthday gifts for our wives.	156.789	4.171
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So in March of 2020, I thought, “Hey, this is a great time.	161.427	4.505
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	We're going to buy Kayla  a 30 year Treasury.”	166.199	2.235
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	- Now, now, hold on. To be clear...	168.434	2.603
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	This isn't real Austin?	171.037	1.735
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	- No, no, no.  - This is this is hypothetical Austin?	172.772	1.902
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	- This is bad decision, hypothetical Austin. - Oh man, good.	174.674	2.336
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	- So the Treasury, the interest rate was whopping 0.99%.	177.677	4.671
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So you, on the other hand,	182.982	2.403
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	look at Emily and say, “Oh, I love my wife and I want to buy her a treasury.”	185.385	3.737
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	You do it, though...	189.489	0.801
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	In October of 2022, when interest rates were 4.4%.	190.29	3.904
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So I got distracted with the 1600lb King Kong	195.094	4.138
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	who was on my side pushing prices up.	199.232	2.069
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So I was like, this is a great time to buy.	201.301	2.168
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	I made a bad choice.	203.469	1.836
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	You, on the other hand, saw that the 800lb gorilla	205.305	2.903
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	had flown the interest rates up and you're going to get paid well.	208.208	3.069
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	But on the flip side, what's happening is that if Kayla's	212.145	4.538
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	treasury was $1,000, it's only to be paying her $9.90 annually.	216.683	4.538
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Emily's treasury, on the other hand, is going to be paying her $44,	221.754	3.204
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	for that same $1000 investment.	224.958	2.669
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And so if they wanted to trade bonds,  Kayla would know that	227.627	4.638
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Emily would be sacrificing $34.10	232.265	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	to take over - to trade the bonds equally.	235.535	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And so there's a little bit of price adjustment because Kayla’s held her	238.771	3.571
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	for two and a half years.	242.375	1.001
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	But let's just say that that's all equal.	243.376	2.836
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Kayla would have to pay Emily about $540 to make sure that Emily was whole	246.212	4.204
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	because of that loss of annual interest payment.	250.883	3.204
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So if you're keeping track of this at home,	254.42	3.17
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	that's a loss of basically half of the value of the bond	257.59	3.504
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	there because of those interest rate movements in two and a half years.	261.661	3.937
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Yeah, in two and half years.	265.632	1.067
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And you think about it, if bonds-- if that 30 year Treasury was paying 0.99%	266.699	5.372
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	and it shoots up to 4.4%, that's the low to the high across that time period.	272.071	5.739
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	That's a really big move in an interest rate that's 3.5%.	278.111	4.871
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	I mean, that's a big move in an interest rate.	283.016	1.735
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So it's going to be a big shock to the system,	284.751	2.435
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	especially if you're on that long end of that seesaw.	287.186	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So if we look inversely on that seesaw, instead of being out	290.189	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	30 years, we're that movement with that gorilla is really big.	293.192	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	If you're in closer to the middle,	296.396	1.668
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	that movement isn't going to be a substantial if.	298.064	1.802
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	I bought Kayla a 38 Treasury bill in March.	299.866	2.736
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Well, yeah, interest rates were still low in April and May,	302.602	3.603
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	but as they started rising, then my bonds would have turned over	306.472	3.838
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	every month and we would have been able to start realizing some of that	310.31	3.803
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	increase of interest rates that we saw in 2022.	314.714	2.936
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So that's where bond investors	317.65	1.001
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	really need to be aware of the term of their bond investment.	318.651	3.17
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	It's really crucial to know where interest rates are	321.921	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	and then where they are on that seesaw for that volatility.	324.991	3.503
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Because at the end of the day, we need to recognize that longer	329.329	3.636
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	term bonds generally pay us a higher rate	333.132	2.97
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	in most environments where the economy is kind of puttering along or doing better	336.102	3.77
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	because we're at risk  for a longer period of time.	340.94	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	There are circumstances where that can be flipped, it can be inverse,	344.41	3.47
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	but that's usually when we're heading towards recession or something like that.	348.047	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So, Spencer, we've just talked about term.	352.051	1.935
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Let’s talk about credit quality next, and we think about the highest credit quality,	353.986	4.605
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	we typically think the US government.	358.591	2.369
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	But there's a lot of different places that bond investors can invest,	360.96	3.37
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	and a lot of different credit quality that we can pursue higher rates of return.	364.63	3.671
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Why don't you explore credit quality a little bit for us?	368.334	2.436
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Well, if you look at any kind of financial planning or investment textbook, it's	370.77	3.87
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	going to say that the US government is the risk-free rate of return.	374.64	3.871
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	There's not any company that's out there that can go down in the basement	379.145	3.537
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	and fire up the printing press and pay off their debts.	382.682	2.736
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	The US government can do so.	385.418	1.435
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	We have our own currency there.	386.853	2.302
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So we have that unique capability	389.155	3.17
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	to be able to mitigate risk	392.692	3.27
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	I guess you could say.	395.962	1.301
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	If we think about generally lending,	397.263	2.536
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	if we lend, whether it's a person or an institution, government money.	399.799	4.204
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	One of the things in the back of our minds is that we've got to bear is	404.37	3.704
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	are we going to get our money back? Because we're typically lending,	408.908	4.004
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Say we lend $10,000. We're going to get paid interest through the term of that loan.	413.413	5.605
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And then at the end we get paid back our principal.	419.318	2.736
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So it's really important that we get paid back our principal.	422.054	2.67
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So the credit quality, though, is this analysis to say how likely are we	424.724	4.838
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	are we to get the payments	429.896	2.702
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	through the term of the loan, but then also at the end	432.598	4.338
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	that we get the principal back?	436.936	1.134
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	If we think about	439.105	1.535
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	a couple of different companies, let's say company ABC is very,	440.64	3.27
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	very strong, very good product line, a lot of cash on hand, run very well.	443.91	5.105
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	We might not require a whole lot more interest to be paid	449.615	3.771
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	if we're lending them money than say we lend to the US government.	453.386	3.403
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So let's say the government	456.989	1.302
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	we can get a ten year Treasury at this particular time for 4%.	458.291	3.537
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And this company we're lending to, we're requiring them	462.195	3.47
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	to pay us four and a half percent.	465.665	1.802
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	We think that the potential for default for them to go under or have issues	467.467	5.005
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	with their credit are almost nil over the term of the next ten years.	472.472	5.305
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Let's just say. Maybe we factor in a default rate of something	477.777	3.136
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	like 1/10 of 1%, but we are getting a half percent more.	480.913	4.204
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So it works out well for us, maybe relative to US treasuries,	485.485	3.737
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	if we think about a different company and let's call this company DEF,	490.056	3.804
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	then that company, perhaps their product line is not quite as strong.	494.327	4.704
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	They don't have quite as much cash on hand.	499.265	2.169
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	They don't have quite the brand.	501.434	1.401
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Let's say that we	504.57	0.901
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	think that the rate of default might be	505.471	2.97
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	probabilistically 3%.	509.242	2.402
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	We might require that they pay us 10% on an annual basis every year	511.644	5.138
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	because we're taking on some default risk there.	516.983	2.903
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	There are certain outcomes of of the direction of this company	519.886	3.637
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	where maybe one in 30, one in 40 times, they're going to go under over the next	523.523	5.138
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	ten years. So we're pricing that in.	528.661	2.669
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	As we do that, what we have to recognize	531.33	2.67
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	is that that increase in interest rate actually probably needs to be	534.0	5.071
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	far above and beyond the default rate because we're taking on more risk.	539.071	3.838
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	The ride is going to be more volatile typically	542.909	3.503
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	because if we have a slowdown related to the economy,	546.412	4.004
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	then those bonds are going to move up and down in value accordingly.	550.683	3.804
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So if we rolled things back to 2007, let's just say, and we're right on the cusp	554.921	4.471
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	of the global financial crisis, we don't know it, and that company	559.392	3.436
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	goes into difficult times.	563.596	3.136
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Then a year later, their bonds might only be trading	567.033	3.436
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	for $0.80 on the dollar, so that $10,000 investment now	570.469	3.838
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	I can only get $8,000 if I try to trade it,	574.307	2.502
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	because people are very concerned about a default risk.	576.809	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	What it's kind of like, I think about different people I could lend to.	580.112	3.037
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	I'm not going to lend somebody on the street the same amount of money	583.749	2.77
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	that I would maybe lend you or my parents, people that I trust.	586.519	3.47
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	I'm going to be a little bit more willing to take lower interest because I trust	590.69	4.704
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	that you're going to pay me back, whereas some random person.	595.394	3.504
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	But again, if it's somebody that I'm not as well accustomed	599.365	3.67
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	with or well acquainted with,	603.035	1.068
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	if it's just a neighbor that says, “Hey, I need $20, can you pay me back.”	604.103	4.171
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	I'm not going to be	609.308	0.801
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	as trusting that I will get my money back.	610.109	3.403
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And so that's kind of what we think about	613.98	1.234
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	in credit quality. If I know you,	615.214	1.668
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	if I know that there is trustworthiness behind what you're doing,	616.882	3.571
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	then you're not going to need to pay me as much.	620.953	2.503
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	But if I don't know you that well, you really need to.	623.456	2.536
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	I need some more more interest, more skin in the game	625.992	3.269
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	to be able to be willing to make that loan.	629.261	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So finally, we're going to talk about liquidity.	632.398	2.903
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	We want to think about the purpose of bonds,	635.301	2.636
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	and that is generally to have a less volatile ride	637.937	4.271
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	than stocks, give us some consistent income,	642.375	3.236
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	and if we need to to sell those bonds	646.379	3.303
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	for purchases or things that might come up unexpectedly even.	650.116	3.637
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	As we think about these different factors, this last one, in terms of the liquidity	655.187	6.273
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	is an important consideration because it just basically means that	661.527	3.17
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	we can't get to the bond as easily or the fixed income as easily.	664.697	4.771
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	If we think about an illiquid bond, it might be loaning	670.77	4.337
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	to an individual or to a company	675.174	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	or to some kind of circumstance where	678.31	3.104
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	since it's not publicly traded,	682.481	1.936
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	we can't access those funds nearly as easily.	684.417	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	If we lend to Apple or to the US government,	687.72	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	we can go to a bond market that opens five days a week	691.123	4.505
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	and we can trade that with someone else because they know that Apple	695.628	4.805
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	and the US government have certain characteristics	700.433	2.669
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	and there are certain ways that those bonds are set up.	703.102	2.469
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	The language, the legal language makes it easy to trade.	705.571	3.504
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	If we instead make a loan to a private company that might be smaller,	709.442	3.87
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	then we don't have that same capacity to trade in the publicly traded market.	713.979	5.072
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Now, the good news  on the other side of things,	720.319	2.202
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	is oftentimes if we're  lending to a company like that	722.521	3.27
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	or even to an individual, the interest rate is higher	725.791	3.203
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	and the credit quality may not be much different.	729.562	2.936
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So if the interest rate is higher and let's say we know that	732.498	3.37
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	that particular part of our fixed income, we're not going to touch	735.868	3.437
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	for the next couple of years that illiquidity may not be a big driver for us.	739.438	5.105
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	We might like the fact that instead of , again, in that last example	744.543	3.871
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	company DEF paying us 10%.	748.414	3.07
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Well, if we could lend to a company that had similar credit characteristics,	751.484	4.437
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	but we just knew that we weren't	756.388	1.202
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	going to be able to access the funds over the next quarter or year.	757.59	3.904
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Or maybe we have a limited level of liquidity.	761.494	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	If they pay us another two or 3%, maybe that starts to sound attractive	764.53	4.271
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	because there are some investments that we want to have, very liquid	769.201	3.103
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	primary reserve, you know, other things that we can take withdrawals from.	772.605	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	But if we have a portion of our investments	775.875	2.235
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	that are relatively illiquid or have some barriers	778.11	4.271
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	to get to them on a day to day basis, at least. That can actually be nice	782.381	4.104
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	for our portfolio if we're compensated for that illiquidity element.	786.485	4.171
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And typically that does happen.	791.19	1.802
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So it might be two or 3% more that an interest rate would be	792.992	4.738
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	paid to us to make those illiquid investments.	798.23	3.27
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And as we think about this kind of overall,	802.368	2.836
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	when you think about like you're saying, okay, primary reserve	805.204	3.236
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	needs to be very liquid, we have to always come back to	808.44	3.17
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	what are the risks that we're willing to take on.	811.61	2.77
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And if we need the funds, then we don't want to put it in these	814.38	3.57
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	higher risk investments unless we have liquidity	818.184	3.87
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	and unless we have the risk tolerance to be able to say, “Hey, I've got all that	822.354	4.004
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	I need for the next	826.358	0.935
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	X amount of months and I'm comfortable with that or the next X amount of years.”	827.293	3.47
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And so in all of these circumstances, we really need to factor	831.33	3.17
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	in what is that risk tolerance that I'm willing to take?	834.5	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Because you can be risky with bonds like we've seen.	837.503	3.37
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	You can go very illiquid, or low credit quality	840.873	4.471
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	or long duration or or short term,	845.344	3.003
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	but you just have to know what is my goal?	848.347	2.803
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	What am I going for with this investment?	851.15	1.668
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And if I don't know that, it's really hard to determine that for a client.	852.818	3.971
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	So that's where we really work hard with our clients to say,	856.789	3.437
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	Hey, what is your goal with this investment?	860.626	2.636
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	What are you hoping to do with it?	863.262	2.002
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	And then we start matching their goals with those investments	865.264	2.936
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	that they want to make.	868.2	0.968
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	But that's really the first place that we need to start.	869.168	2.302
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	We hope that this discussion of bonds, fixed income,	871.47	3.771
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	their factors, how we think about rates of return has been helpful.	875.241	3.036
v1r8VMWuWz4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1r8VMWuWz4	As always, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us.	878.277	3.003

QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Using an evidence based approach to investing	0.6	3.17
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	is a lot like using modern medicine. Just like physicians	3.77	3.103
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	have to have an empirical evidence to their prescribed paths,	6.873	4.771
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	when we look at the evidence based approach to investment,	11.911	3.037
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	we've got to look back at history and say, okay, we're learning some things here	14.948	3.737
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and we're trying to take those learnings and build a portfolio,	18.952	3.336
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	just like physicians are no longer prescribing leeches and bloodletting	22.522	5.305
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	for all kinds of different maladies like they were a couple hundred years ago.	28.028	3.236
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	We want to look at the evidence that we have and try	31.664	2.603
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	to construct a portfolio that makes sense given what we've seen.	34.267	4.004
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Today we're going to be  talking a little bit deeper	42.375	1.902
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	about the performance of the  factors that we talked about	44.277	3.137
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	in a previous video. Just as a reminder and some disclosures here.	47.414	3.57
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	We're going to be looking at size, value and profitability.	51.217	2.736
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	If you don't remember what we're talking about,	53.953	2.236
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	feel free to go back to the last episode and watch that	56.189	2.569
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and we're also gonna be looking at past performance. That doesn't guarantee	58.758	3.37
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	any future results, just like a doctor might prescribe statins.	62.162	3.27
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	It may not treat that illness.	65.698	2.303
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Past performance doesn't guarantee anything in the future.	68.001	3.136
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So, Spencer, as we look at these factors and the tilts of the portfolio	71.538	2.869
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	that we talked about in that previous episode,	74.407	2.336
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	what are some things that we need to know just in general	76.743	2.369
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	about when we look at performance of this?	79.112	1.902
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	One of the things that we	81.014	0.767
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	want to remind ourselves is that we don't want to just focus on one factor	81.781	3.871
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	or another.	85.652	0.767
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	You hit three of them	86.419	1.802
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and the way that we want to look at	88.221	1.501
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	this is kind of trying to bring them all together	89.722	2.47
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	because we know that there's going to be some seasons	92.192	2.068
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	when any one of them is not going to perform all that well.	94.26	3.17
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So as we build	97.464	0.8
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	a portfolio, we want to recognize that there's going to be periods again	98.264	3.737
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	where those factors don't show up or where the premium would be negative.	102.302	4.237
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	It would not be in our favor there.	106.806	3.003
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And so we want to frame this kind of as like there's a six sided die	110.076	5.139
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	that we're rolling.	115.248	0.734
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	If we had that dice and we had an opportunity to roll it one time	115.982	4.571
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and I posed you and	121.02	2.603
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and let's just say you're getting close to retirement.	123.623	2.736
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	You've saved a lifetime.	126.359	1.268
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And if you roll a one, two, three, or four, then your money doubles.	127.627	5.272
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	- I like it.  - Yeah.	133.333	1.134
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But if you're all of five or six, all that money goes away.	134.467	3.637
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	- I don’t like it... - You lose everything.	138.104	2.036
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Most folks, as they approach retirement, they're not going to take that gamble	140.14	3.37
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	because even though on average you're going to do well	143.843	3.937
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	there, you're going to have far too much risk in terms of being exposed.	147.947	4.505
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	If I then said, well, now you've got ten rolls of the dice	152.852	4.271
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and you only have to get five of them as a one, two, three or four,	157.123	4.038
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	that's stacking the odds in your favor again,	161.694	2.303
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	because we've got more rolls. In the same way,	163.997	2.936
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	if we can have more time instead of looking at one year	166.933	3.47
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	save for our factors, we think about ten years, then	170.67	2.87
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	we're able to stack the odds a bit more in our favor.	173.54	3.003
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So again, if you only have to roll a one, two, three or four,	176.809	3.637
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	five times out of ten, then your probability increases to 92%	180.914	5.538
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	that your money is going to double and still 8% that you lose everything.	186.653	4.304
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	That may still not be an acceptable risk.	191.191	2.769
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	You know, you've worked	193.96	1.435
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	a lifetime for these funds, so you may say too much risk still there.	195.395	3.937
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Well, what if we looked at it and we said, you get 100 rolls of the dice	199.599	3.804
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and you only have to get 50 as a one, two, three, or four.	203.636	3.137
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Now we look at a percentage that something like 99.98%.	207.073	5.405
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	I think.  So an incredibly high percentage	212.645	3.237
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and that may, you know, incline you again to move in that direction	215.882	4.338
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	to take the gamble because again, the the odds are stacked in your favor.	220.22	4.037
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	We don't believe that we can ever completely guarantee that we're going to	224.424	4.471
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	stack the odds in a client's favor to the point	230.029	2.136
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	where they're going to be certain of that benefit.	232.165	4.404
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But what we do want to do is progressively move things in a direction	236.836	3.67
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	where we are stacking the odds in their favor	240.773	2.169
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	without taking on a tremendous amount more risk in the process.	242.942	4.271
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	That's why we want to blend these factors size, value, profitability,	247.38	4.938
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	because we know that there's a high likelihood that at some point in time	252.719	3.77
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	one of those factors is not going to show up in a particular year.	256.489	2.469
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And we'll go through what we've seen over	258.958	2.069
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	the last many decades, but also over the last decade,	261.027	3.403
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	which has shown that the value premium has actually been negative	264.931	4.237
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	over the last ten years in the US and also around the world.	269.335	3.07
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So let's go ahead and look into some of these historical premiums.	272.538	3.003
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And really we want to look over, just like you were saying, it's not just a	275.708	3.704
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	one year, we're going to look five years and ten years down the line.	279.412	3.704
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So we're going to pull up a slide.	283.116	2.569
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	It's the historical performance of premiums over these rolling periods.	285.685	4.104
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So think about Tuesday, April 19th of 2023  to Tuesday, April 19th of 2024.	289.789	8.075
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	This data is going to come from	297.93	1.235
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	dimensional fund advisors and the research that they have done.	299.165	3.77
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So let's just go ahead and start off with the market against T-bills.	302.935	3.938
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So again, T-bills are those really short timeframe government issuances.	307.206	4.438
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	In a one year period, 70% of the time,	312.512	3.136
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	the stock market beat T-bills, Right?	316.382	3.404
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	That's a pretty good odd.	319.886	1.301
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And it's US stocks here against Treasury bills.	321.454	4.071
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So 30 day bonds	325.525	3.036
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	essentially are bills that are issued by the US government.	328.828	2.803
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	This would be in financial planning or investment textbooks.	331.631	3.17
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	This would be known as the risk free rate of return,	335.034	3.237
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	so guaranteed by the full faith	339.405	1.468
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and credit of the US government versus the stock market over a one year basis.	340.873	4.538
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	You know, we look back to the 1920s and 70% of the time, like you	345.678	5.172
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	said, Austin, we see US stock market beating Treasury bills.	350.85	4.938
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Yeah.	355.855	0.634
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Which, you know, you think about and you're like, that makes sense.	356.489	2.536
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	The US stock market should do that.	359.025	2.135
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But again, over those one year rolling periods, sometimes T-bills do better.	361.16	4.738
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	If the stock market is down for an extended period of time,	366.032	3.07
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	then T-bills are going to be better for you.	369.302	2.636
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But again, if we extend that out to a five year time frame, again,	371.938	3.804
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	those rolling five year times, 79% of the time, the stock market does better.	375.742	4.437
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	You stretch it out further, ten year time frame,	380.747	2.702
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	86% of the time the market does better than the T-bills.	383.449	3.003
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So again, it's kind of like we're rolling the dice	386.919	2.603
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	100 times versus rolling the dice six times.	389.522	3.537
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Right.	393.092	0.601
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Well, and when we look at that ten year period, it really is	393.693	2.936
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	kind of 1-in-6 or 1-in-7	396.629	3.47
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	periods where we see  T-bills outperforming the market.	401.067	3.904
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And we've seen that in the last 20 years.	404.971	1.601
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	You know, if you think about where the stock market was	406.572	3.003
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	at the technology bubble peak in 2000, we had a big drop thereafter.	409.575	5.139
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	We saw a recovery and pressed into new all time highs.	414.714	2.636
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But then we saw the global financial crisis.	417.35	2.135
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So from 2000 to 2010,	419.485	3.737
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	many of those periods in there, if we just look at that ten year time	423.456	3.403
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	frame, indeed, T-bills outperformed the US stock market,	426.859	4.238
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	but most of the time that's not going to be true.	431.464	2.736
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	We do have to recognize, though, that that is one of the pieces that can occur.	434.2	4.504
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So let's now take a look at value versus growth.	439.372	2.469
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Again, if you don't remember	441.841	0.901
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	what value and growth are, you take a look back at that last video that we did.	442.742	3.637
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But again, that one year time frame, 60% of the time value beats growth.	446.846	5.405
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	That's a pretty, pretty decent job.	452.718	2.203
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	You stretch it out five years, it's 70%.	454.921	3.436
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Ten years, we get to 79%.	458.357	2.57
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Again, there's going to be periods where it doesn't outperform growth rate.	460.927	3.67
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But over the last 100 years or so, it's done pretty well.	464.697	3.704
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Value's done pretty well.	468.601	1.501
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Yeah.	470.102	0.301
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And one of those ten year periods has been the last ten years.	470.403	3.236
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So we want to be open with that.	473.639	1.502
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	There are ten year periods where that doesn't work out,	475.141	2.536
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	but about four out of five times	477.677	2.536
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	if we're rounding there, it does work in our favor.	480.213	2.836
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So let's look at small versus large.	483.049	1.601
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And again, the story remains the same.	484.65	2.102
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	One year there's a much tighter window, 56%	486.752	3.404
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	of the time, small cap stocks do better than large cap in a five year	490.156	4.271
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	time frame, 60% in a ten year time frame, 69%.	494.427	4.071
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Right. So, again, this is just historical.	498.498	2.168
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	We're not saying going forward that this is going to be the case.	500.666	2.503
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But if we look at ten year periods, more than two thirds of the time	503.169	3.937
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	when looking back at the last hundred years or so, we see that	507.473	4.304
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	small companies have outperformed their large counterparts.	512.111	2.97
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Yeah.	515.081	0.767
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Finally, let's look at high versus low profitability.	515.848	3.003
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And again, the story remains true.	519.151	2.67
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	High profitability companies beat low profitability in that one year	521.821	3.904
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	66% of the time, five year, 82%,	525.725	3.103
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and then a ten year, 92% of the time.	529.161	3.003
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	High profitability companies regularly outperform	532.231	3.27
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	their low profitability counterparts.	535.501	2.97
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And we do want to just acknowledge	538.604	2.169
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	we don't go all the way back to the 1920s on this data sequence.	540.773	3.504
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	There were disclosures that started to be made, I think, in the 1960s that allowed	544.644	3.97
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	the research here so we can only go back about 60 years	549.282	3.27
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	rather than close to 100 years in terms of the research here.	552.552	3.069
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But you can see high profitability beating.	555.755	2.002
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Low profitability has been very, very consistent.	557.757	4.404
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	When we look at a ten year basis about 92% of the time.	562.161	3.437
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So again, not every time,	565.598	2.469
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	but about nine out of ten times when we look at those ten year sequences.	568.067	3.103
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Right.	571.17	0.634
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And I think this is where we come back and say, as we're	571.804	2.87
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	constructing portfolios, we're not just looking at one factor	574.674	4.204
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	nor are we saying we're going to put everything in smallcaps	579.211	2.97
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	or everything in value companies or everything in high profitability.	582.281	3.103
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	We're going to take a broad look at the market,	585.651	2.736
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	but just shade that portfolio a little bit towards small, a little bit more	588.387	3.904
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	towards value then maybe a traditional index that follows the S&P 500.	592.291	4.104
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Sure.	596.629	0.701
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And as we think about that, as companies move around there,	597.33	3.87
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	they become more or less attractive based on their characteristics	601.2	3.67
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	of value, size and profitability.	604.87	3.003
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So firms oftentimes over the course of a year	608.007	3.036
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	will be more attractive at one point, less attractive at one point.	611.043	3.27
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And that again, gives us the opportunity to align accordingly.	614.313	4.271
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So, Spencer, we want to take a look now at these premiums across different	618.584	4.304
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	geographies, so it's not just the US that we see these premiums popping up,	622.888	4.171
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	it's in the emerging markets within the developed markets.	627.293	2.836
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So as we look at this slide, what we want to show is really just	630.129	3.403
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	that you can see, yes, we don't have data going back	633.532	3.571
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	as far for the developed markets or for emerging markets,	637.103	3.003
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	but you can see that small companies outperform their large counterparts	640.139	4.471
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	across the US, the developed markets and the emerging.	644.91	3.437
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Again, this is historical,	649.081	1.502
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	so it's not looking forward, but it's saying what has the past shown us?	650.583	3.203
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	We look at value minus growth.	654.186	2.102
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Value has outperformed growth in the US, in the developed markets,	656.288	4.171
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	in the emerging markets, and as well profitability, high	660.459	3.904
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	profitability companies across all three planes,	664.363	3.37
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	the US, international, and emerging markets have outperformed over time.	667.733	4.271
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But again, that's not always the case.	672.004	1.502
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So let's take a look at the last ten years	673.506	1.701
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and as we think about the last ten years, we have	675.207	3.137
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	seen of those nine areas, five of them show up and four of them not,	678.344	5.572
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and value has been negative over that time.	684.15	3.837
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So going through that again the last ten years,	687.987	3.036
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	as we think about 2013 through 2022,	691.023	3.137
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	we look at company size and then the US large companies have actually beaten	694.86	4.071
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	their small counterparts by about 1.8% on average.	698.931	3.57
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	If we look overseas though, in the developed world,	702.968	3.204
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	those smaller companies	707.306	1.201
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	have outpaced their large counterparts by about 1.2% on average.	708.507	3.737
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And then in the emerging markets, even more so, about 2.4%.	712.244	4.038
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Now, across the board, when we look at value again relative price,	716.282	3.737
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	we see that value has underperformed growth in the last ten years.	720.286	3.737
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And I think if we go back to that, former slide and thought process,	724.023	3.637
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	about 1-in-5 10 year periods,	727.66	3.07
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	you're going to see value underperform growth.	730.73	3.203
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	If we go back many, many years going back into the 1920s in the US.	733.933	4.471
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	And it'd be similar if we looked at those time	738.938	1.735
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	periods in the developed world in the emerging markets.	740.673	2.069
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But in the last ten years, again it's shown up.	742.742	1.735
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So value has underperformed growth by about 1.75%	744.477	4.371
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	in the last ten years.	748.848	1.935
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	Value has underperformed growth by a smaller margin.	750.783	2.569
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	In the developed world that would be international outside	753.352	4.238
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	of the emerging markets,	757.59	1.067
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	again, by about 7/10 of a percent and then just barely underperformed	758.657	3.737
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	in the emerging markets by about 6/100 of a percent.	762.394	3.304
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	If we shift over to profitability, though, you can see it's really been	766.165	3.103
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	a banner season there for us stocks, high profitability versus	769.502	5.038
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	their low profitability counterparts over 5% in terms of that difference.	774.54	4.805
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	We look at that in the developed world, in the emerging markets,	779.645	3.036
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	not quite as much, a little bit over 2% in each one of those different areas.	782.681	4.071
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So that's why we look at these.	787.086	1.468
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	We know that there's going to be periods	788.554	2.469
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	where these factors don't show up or when they're negative.	791.023	3.37
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	But we also think as we look back at history, an evidence-based approach	794.393	4.104
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	would learn from these pieces and then use that in terms of portfolio construction.	798.764	4.538
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	As we do this, we want to remind you that past performance	803.569	3.503
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	does not guarantee any level of future results.	807.072	3.237
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	We try to learn from history,	810.442	1.335
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	but we acknowledge that the future may be quite different.	811.777	3.003
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	So it's important as you work to build a portfolio	815.014	3.837
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	that you talk with your financial advisor, you reflect on these things	818.851	3.57
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	and not take this as prescriptive in your particular case.	822.655	3.637
QcGWfoXXtj8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGWfoXXtj8	With that hope that you've enjoyed this video, Take care.	826.659	3.003
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	[Music]	0.761	0.439
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	thank you	1.2	10.08
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	yeah all right so let's move on from there and  wrap it up with oil because this is something you	12.9	6.06
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	know we two months ago we put out a our catching  the next wave newsletter we highlighted the energy	18.96	8.04
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	sector and I purposely did it right around that  time frame because I felt that short term there	27.0	6.78
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	could be some softness in oil and and energy names  that I would want to buy into because while I felt	33.78	6.72
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	that for the first half of first quarter of this  year oil prices could be soft based on the charts	40.5	6.72
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	and we talked about this last time that that we  felt oil was consolidating off of the first kind	48.36	6.48
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	of bear Market or bull market rally that it's  creating and we're expecting another rally of	54.84	5.58
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	similar size and so this is just that kind  of consolidation period where a market that	60.42	5.34
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	grows can correct by time or price and this  one's doing it really with time and price so	65.76	6.96
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	that those two green lines are really really key  it's a big support Zone that's a problem with big	73.68	6.18
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	support zones is you got to give it patience of  like a 10 point range which is not easy to do	79.86	4.92
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	and so that that we're resting right now in  oil we bounced off of it this past week that	85.62	6.72
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	dark green line so right now that critical  support line for oil looks like it's held	92.34	5.76
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	and it looks like you know and I I think of the  next few few weeks the next five percent in oil	98.88	6.3
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	could be up or down I don't know what it is  but I still believe the next 50 percent or 30	105.18	4.8
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	percent is higher not lower and our thesis  in our catch the next wave was really it's	109.98	8.1
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	around supply issues you've got some demand  things because China's coming back online	118.08	4.74
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	and but more so you've got some supply issues  and then also geopolitically if we have what	124.26	5.16
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	we talked about in the dollar and in gold and  foreign currencies trading oil I think we start	129.42	7.92
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	to get really in a situation where the Saudis it  really benefits them to keep pushing prices higher	137.34	6.72
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	I also think the Saudis are at an age where they  they need to make this their last hurray not that	144.06	5.58
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	they don't have enough money already but you know  when you're 50 and you like want to you know call	149.64	5.28
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	it quits you know the next 10 years you probably  push oil as high as you can and make as much money	154.92	5.16
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	as you can so and that being but that being said  that's maybe the Saudis view but you know we have	160.08	5.22
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	a lot of oil and gas investments in the alt space  and a lot of the oil companies aren't actually	165.3	4.8
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	in favor of 200 150 oil because it just creates  so much destruction so much long-term pain that	170.1	6.12
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	they're fine with 70 to 80 a barrel oil it's not  like they want that to potentially happen in the	176.22	5.76
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	U.S side no I don't think anybody really wants it  um other than the Saudis somebody's gonna have to	181.98	6.84
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	make a decision yeah because we were supposed to  be changing overall vehicles in 2035 according	188.82	5.76
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	to well and that's why I think political well  that's why it's changing yeah that's why I feel	194.58	7.38
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	that that's where you come into supply issues is  because we've had such a big ESG environmental	201.96	5.28
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	move around this you've kind of the last 10 years  you've really shut off a lot of Supply you've shut	207.24	5.88
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	off a lot of drilling you've shut off a lot of  things in anticipation of more solar and wind	213.12	5.34
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	um and now you know we're starting starting to see  that wow we didn't really plan this out you know	219.54	5.16
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	when when you see that that you know the perfect  comes to the government well yeah I mean a perfect	224.7	4.38
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	example is yeah I would love to see electric  cars really be perfect for the environment right	229.08	6.0
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	but then when I read articles about oh yeah you  know what you get in a small fender bender with	235.08	4.68
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	a Tesla and they end up scrapping it because  the expense to repair the battery is so high	239.76	5.7
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	the insurance company's like yeah so now you all  of a sudden you have cars with very minor damage	245.46	5.76
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	that are going off and getting scrapped and now  that's just adding to the environment you know	251.22	5.34
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	like that wasn't thought out right right and and  normally you would have had an industry that says	256.56	5.76
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	hey let's make sure it's right for the consumer  including replacement value right right that	262.32	5.64
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	wasn't thought through or take it granular and the  fact that all battery cars are twice as heavy as a	267.96	6.36
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	regular vehicle causing more wear and tear on the  roads and tires and all that type of stuff which	274.32	4.08
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	is increases yeah so I think all those things  the whole ESG movement has just helped add to the	278.4	6.06
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	demand and oil and you do it it's kind of gotten  the the unintended consequence of a good idea um	284.46	7.02
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	and bad execution um and it'll get better but in  the near term and from an investment perspective	291.48	5.94
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	um I like the idea of watching oil and and  that green line is really really crucial	298.68	4.86
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	if we break below that and say have sustained  trade below that then the whole thesis on oil	303.54	5.34
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	is completely wrong I'll have to you know  save fate out you know I don't know what	308.88	4.5
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	I'll do something an embarrassment our  next our next video yeah so stay tuned	313.38	6.48
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	[Music]	324.26	1.0
Wgn0DaZ7xjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgn0DaZ7xjk	thank you	325.26	1.44

xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	hi there it's Eric Bennis from the team	0.359	4.261
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	here at John Graham and Associates and	2.639	3.841
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	today we're going to be discussing six	4.62	6.68
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	keys for more successful investing	6.48	4.82
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	[Music]	12.27	16.1
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	the first key is to always think about	29.42	6.34
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	long-term compounding so when you go to	32.96	5.5
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	invest typically especially if you're	35.76	5.52
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	going for retirement Investments you're	38.46	4.619
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	thinking about the long term and what	41.28	3.18
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	does compounding actually look like	43.079	4.081
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	because it is a very powerful tool so	44.46	4.5
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	imagine this scenario you have ten	47.16	4.02
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	thousand dollars and you invest it for	48.96	4.56
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	the long term right and it makes eight	51.18	4.64
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	percent a year on average for 20 years	53.52	4.679
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	well I know you only started with ten	55.82	3.759
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	thousand but actually at the end of	58.199	3.061
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	those 20 years you end up with over	59.579	4.081
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	forty six thousand dollars simply by	61.26	4.14
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	being patient and allowing the money to	63.66	2.94
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	compound	65.4	3.3
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	now the real power in long-term	66.6	3.96
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	compounding is the longer that we wait	68.7	5.279
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	the more rapidly we can advance that	70.56	5.099
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	compounding so remember in our previous	73.979	4.741
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	scenario we waited about 20 years and we	75.659	4.621
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	made more than four times our initial	78.72	3.78
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	investment well let's say we wait just	80.28	4.56
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	another 10 years so now we've put in ten	82.5	3.96
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	thousand dollars and we've waited 30	84.84	3.0
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	years right	86.46	3.6
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	at that point you not only double your	87.84	3.36
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	investment triple your investment	90.06	3.3
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	quadruple you've actually made well over	91.2	4.739
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	a hundred thousand dollars off a simple	93.36	5.34
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	initial ten thousand dollar contribution	95.939	4.801
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	now what you have to remember is you	98.7	4.5
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	left it in we assumed an eight percent	100.74	5.4
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	average annual return and you didn't	103.2	4.32
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	make those withdrawals so you have to	106.14	2.339
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	leave it in there and allow it to	107.52	3.0
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	compound over time and that's where the	108.479	4.021
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	power of compounding comes from	110.52	4.68
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	so tip number two is you want to be able	112.5	5.22
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	to endure short-term pain in exchange	115.2	4.86
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	for a long-term gain what I mean by that	117.72	4.259
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	is every once in a while you're going to	120.06	3.78

xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	red lines with the arrows going down and	123.84	3.12

xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	for Wall Street or something like that	129.78	3.72
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	and you want to be able to stick with	131.7	3.899
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	your initial your initial plan that you	133.5	4.62
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	and your advisor came up with and you	135.599	4.801
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	want to be able to endure that initial	138.12	4.68
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	discomfort that you're going to	140.4	3.3
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	experience here and there with the	142.8	2.579
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	market ups and downs because you know in	143.7	3.84
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	the back of your mind that long term you	145.379	4.261
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	are averaging that eight percent you are	147.54	3.72
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	doubling your money tripling your money	149.64	4.02
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	over time so having the discipline to	151.26	4.86
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	stick with it is incredibly important	153.66	4.68
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	so tip number three is to pick an	156.12	5.16
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	appropriate asset allocation and this is	158.34	4.92
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	the step where a lot of people start to	161.28	4.14
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	involve a Financial Consultant such as	163.26	4.08
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	somebody on our team and the reason for	165.42	3.84
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	that is not a lot of people necessarily	167.34	4.14
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	feel comfortable picking their own asset	169.26	4.5
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	allocation and then obviously making the	171.48	3.66
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	necessary adjustments throughout their	173.76	3.54
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	life as circumstances change both in	175.14	4.739
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	their life and in the market	177.3	3.24
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	um	179.879	2.461
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	but it's a very important step because	180.54	3.419
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	if you don't start off with a good	182.34	4.14
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	foundation everything you build on top	183.959	4.14
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	is not necessarily going to turn out the	186.48	3.3
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	way you want it to so it's really	188.099	3.541
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	important to get that asset allocation	189.78	3.72
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	correct and think about you know what	191.64	4.019
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	are my goals what are my timelines all	193.5	3.72
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	those things when you're picking that	195.659	3.66
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	asset allocation and again if you don't	197.22	3.48
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	feel comfortable doing that that's what	199.319	3.241
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	we're here for so give us a call and	200.7	4.38
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	it's something that we do every day the	202.56	4.56
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	fourth tip is to understand your time	205.08	4.98
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	Horizon and have a plan for what you	207.12	4.92
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	anticipate in your life we all have	210.06	4.56
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	unknowns that come down the road that we	212.04	4.559
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	weren't expecting but certain things we	214.62	4.08
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	are able to anticipate so let me give	216.599	3.241
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	you an example	218.7	2.52
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	um if you have let's say a hundred	219.84	3.36
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	dollars you don't necessarily want to	221.22	3.9
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	invest all 100 because you want to have	223.2	3.72
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	some for your short-term savings because	225.12	3.3
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	you're going to have the water bill due	226.92	3.48
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	next month you're going to have you know	228.42	3.42
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	the new car that you've been planning to	230.4	2.759
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	get now and you know that you're going	231.84	3.3
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	to do that in six months a lot of these	233.159	4.5
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	short-term things you might not invest	235.14	3.78
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	in the same way that you do your	237.659	3.961
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	long-term stuff such as your retirement	238.92	5.099
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	so it's really important to have that	241.62	4.199
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	discussion with the person that you work	244.019	4.681
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	with if you work with an advisor in	245.819	4.98
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	order so that they understand that they	248.7	3.84
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	have to set aside a certain amount for	250.799	3.841
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	different goals because often somebody	252.54	3.659
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	will come in and they have many	254.64	4.02
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	different goals and the way that you	256.199	4.681
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	invest is very contingent upon what	258.66	4.68
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	you're trying to achieve with that money	260.88	5.4
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	so tip number five is to take advantage	263.34	5.7
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	of dollar cost averaging if you can so	266.28	4.62
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	what dollar cost averaging basically	269.04	3.96
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	does is it means you make an equal and	270.9	5.16
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	periodic investment that takes advantage	273.0	5.16
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	of the fact that you know stocks mutual	276.06	4.139
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	funds everything the prices go up and	278.16	3.36
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	down over time that's what the market	280.199	3.601
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	does it goes up and down but if you're	281.52	4.02
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	making periodic Investments sometimes	283.8	3.179
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	you'll buy it a little higher sometimes	285.54	2.82
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	you'll buy it much lower sometimes	286.979	3.061
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	you'll buy it right in the middle and	288.36	3.779
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	the end result of that typically is that	290.04	3.659
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	you'll end up actually paying less per	292.139	2.641
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	share of whatever it is you're	293.699	2.761
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	purchasing than if you made a single	294.78	4.44
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	lump sum contribution so for example	296.46	5.459
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	let's say that you want to invest for	299.22	5.28
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	your retirement and you're still working	301.919	4.381
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	so you should have current income month	304.5	4.38
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	to month instead of maybe waiting until	306.3	4.32
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	the end of the year and then writing a	308.88	3.48
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	big check for seven thousand dollars to	310.62	3.42
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	put in your IRA or something like that	312.36	3.899
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	where you end up purchasing let's say	314.04	4.08
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	December 20th whatever the prices are	316.259	4.201
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	that day that's what you get if you were	318.12	3.78
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	to spread it out over the 12 months and	320.46	3.54
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	make a monthly contribution	321.9	4.68
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	to your funds you're able to take	324.0	4.199
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	advantage of that dollar cost averaging	326.58	4.26
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	and it will likely end up helping you	328.199	4.621
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	get a better price per share in the long	330.84	2.699
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	run	332.82	3.36
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	our last tip for today is don't just buy	333.539	4.621
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	and forget you've heard the phrase Buy	336.18	3.6
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	and Hold which means to purchase	338.16	3.479
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	something be patient for it to rise in	339.78	3.9
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	value over time but there is a	341.639	3.361
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	difference between holding and	343.68	3.959
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	completely forgetting about the account	345.0	4.74
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	because you do constantly want to be	347.639	4.801
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	reevaluating where you are in life where	349.74	4.38
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	the account stands in relation to	352.44	4.44
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	different Market changes and you want to	354.12	5.22
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	consistently review that account	356.88	4.56
xa-pST69_3k	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-pST69_3k	so that's something that we do as	359.34	3.96

oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	you've got to start thinking differently	120.72	2.7
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	because now time isn't on your side	121.92	3.6

oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	returns that aren't great you could end	125.52	5.219
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	up having to work longer or just change	128.58	4.019
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	your lifestyle not live as as uh	130.739	3.421

oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	retirement so you have a good gain which	134.16	3.18
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	is great but it's only a gain once you	135.78	3.12
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	realize it so a lot of people try to	137.34	3.24
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	talk about the paper gains they have in	138.9	3.66
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	crypto or stock market look at the big	140.58	4.08
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	gain I have and I always say you're not	142.56	4.08
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	up until you're out yep because you	144.66	3.84
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	really haven't you realize the gain so	146.64	3.179
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	you could go up and down and I've seen	148.5	3.0
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	the stock charts you've everyone's seen	149.819	3.541

oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	like this it all bounces all around so	155.879	4.981
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	the secret is to make sure that you	158.819	3.661
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	don't depend on Market timing to have a	160.86	3.18
oHz2IGsHWrc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHz2IGsHWrc	successful retirement so take some of	162.48	3.06

01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Welcome everyone to the Retirement Road Map podcast, brought to you by SHP Financial.	19.09	35.899
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I’m Derek Gregoire with Keith Ellis.	54.989	3.051
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Matt’s out today, but the two of us are holding down the fort.	58.04	2.99
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And we want to introduce you to a special guest, a good friend of ours for well over	61.03	4.55
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	a decade now, Brad Johnson.	65.58	2.43
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And Brad is one of the principals at Triad, which is a firm that works with, helps develop	68.01	6.18
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	hundreds of advisors.	74.19	1.25
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And as we get into the conversation, you’ll kind of see how it relates to retirement planning	75.44	4.68
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	in general.	80.12	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But Brad was instrumental in our growing of SHP Financial over the years.	81.12	4.16
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, without further ado, welcome to the show, Brad.	85.28	3.17
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: What’s up, guys?	88.45	1.02
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Glad to be here.	89.47	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: How are you doing out there?	90.47	1.37
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	How’s Kansas?	91.84	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Kansas?	92.84	1.52
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	The Kansas City metro area is very solid this week.	94.36	3.48
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You may have heard of a team called the Chiefs, they’re in the Super Bowl coming up this	97.84	4.631
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Sunday.	102.471	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, it’s good.	103.471	1.029
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I know you all have to– when the Patriots had their glorious decade run, you had to	104.5	4.15
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	kind of share that with me.	108.65	1.21
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, I figured I would just make sure you guys were up to date on the current sports events.	109.86	3.75
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: But the difference is Keith and I could name more than three people on	113.61	3.11
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	the Patriots.	116.72	1.31
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Just remember that.	118.03	1.35
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: I’m open to the challenge.	119.38	2.81
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Anyhow, well…	122.19	1.73
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: The question is, could you now?	123.92	2.879
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Yes, I guess.	126.799	1.85
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: That’s a good question.	128.649	2.601
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: So, let’s fast forward back to almost around 2010, 2011, almost 13, 14	131.25	7.45
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	years ago or so, we had started our firm as SHP Financial in 2003.	138.7	6.07
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And one of the things that we thought we were growing a firm, we weren’t growing the firm.	144.77	3.95
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It was obviously very slow and steady.	148.72	2.57
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	We’re both in our 20s at that point, early 20s, actually, in early 2000 when we started	151.29	6.32
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	SHP.	157.61	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And then we started getting a little bit of growth over the years and building up our	158.61	2.79
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	clientele, but really, it was a pivotal point when we met and really started getting things	161.4	5.86
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	going around 2011, 2012, 2013, but fast back to that time period, obviously, we were much	167.26	7.14
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	younger, probably less wrinkles, little more hair.	174.4	2.95
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Well, not for you, you had less hair.	177.35	1.48
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: Not gray.	178.83	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: I had less hair back then.	179.83	1.48
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That’s true.	181.31	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: Yeah, you did.	182.31	1.19
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Brad was coming off as– you believe you were an all-American D2 football	183.5	4.23
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	player?	187.73	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: I appreciate you sliding the D2 in there.	188.73	3.97
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Thank you for that.	192.7	1.19
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That’s accurate.	193.89	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: I will say it, though.	194.89	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	On a quick side note, when we first met, I thought I was a pretty good athlete and I	195.89	4.03
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	tried to cover Brad in my backyard running a route.	199.92	2.92
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I was like, “Wow, he is pretty fast.”	202.84	1.72
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, I’ll give him that.	204.56	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I don’t know if he still has those wheels.	205.56	1.48
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: They’re disappearing quickly, but at least better it has been than it never	207.04	7.339
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	was.	214.379	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: The wheel is a little rusty, a little wobbly at this point.	215.379	1.69
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Yeah, they’re wobblier by the minute.	217.069	2.411
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Yeah, exactly.	219.48	1.28
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, even back then, as you’ve helped a lot of advisors, just I guess as a general landscape	220.76	6.07
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	of the advisory world, you’ve seen it all.	226.83	2.829
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You’ve seen the good, the bad, the ugly, the in-between.	229.659	2.891
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, I guess, just share because a lot of our listeners are either working with us or know	232.55	5.769
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	a little bit about us, but I guess just in general, like advisory firms, what does it	238.319	7.051
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	look like and why is it so different?	245.37	1.31
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Because a lot of people think, well, they’re all the same.	246.68	3.01
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	My advisor, this advisor, it’s all the same.	249.69	2.87
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Once they meet with different firms, they realize it’s totally not the case.	252.56	3.53
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But what have you seen over the years?	256.09	1.07
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I guess, how can you frame up the landscape as best as possible?	257.16	4.49
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Yeah.	261.65	2.19
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Short question, big answer, but I’ll try to summarize it.	263.84	5.09
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I know you all are working with a lot of Boston area retirees, and then of course, as they	268.93	5.049
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	retire and relocate and go different places, really retirees all over the country now.	273.979	6.721
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But my journey into finance, as you said, I played football in college.	280.7	4.52
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I was an IT major.	285.22	1.36
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And my first job right out of college was the infamous Payless ShoeSource that no longer	286.58	5.3
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	exists.	291.88	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, I was in corporate America for about three years before I just realized I had a different	292.88	5.48
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	calling.	298.36	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I’d always been interested in finance.	299.36	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Now, I remember buying Google and Chipotle and Under Armour when they IPO’d, that was	300.36	5.77
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	it in my first corporate job, and so, I was really taken the path to– very similar to	306.13	5.23
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	you all, to a captive kind of advisory space, which is what attracts a lot of, I think,	311.36	6.029
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	young advisors fresh out of college.	317.389	3.34
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I was really fortunate, what became one of the largest insurance brokerage companies	320.729	6.361
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and RIAs in the independent space was in my own backyard here in Topeka, Kansas, and I	327.09	6.01
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	got that job when I was 26 years old.	333.1	2.48
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And my job was to work with advisors all across the country, independents.	335.58	3.98
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And we can talk maybe about the difference between independent and captive because my	339.56	3.6
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	guess is a lot of retirees don’t know there is such a difference.	343.16	4.349
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But to fast forward, I remember one of my biggest aha’s.	347.509	5.181
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	This was really young in my career.	352.69	2.78
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I remember thinking of financial advisors very similar to how you think about a doctor.	355.47	5.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Here’s a professional.	360.47	1.5
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You walk into their office and you’ve got this problem or these symptoms of a problem	361.97	4.11
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and they diagnosed it and they offer you professional help.	366.08	3.32
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And that was very much the lens that I looked through in the financial advisory space as	369.4	4.21
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	a 26-year-old when I first got into this business.	373.61	2.77
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That was 2007.	376.38	1.95
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I remember I got on a phone call and we were a brokerage company and there was a product	378.33	6.97
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	that I’ll call it the litmus test for ethics in finance because it was three products.	385.3	8.05
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	They were all the same products.	393.35	1.15
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, think of that for, if you’re a retiree listening and out there, it was a five-year	394.5	3.71
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	just a fixed annuity, think CD, very much like a CD, just a very boring fixed rate product,	398.21	5.37
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	but this was an interesting one.	403.58	2.32
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Doesn’t exist anymore.	405.9	1.78
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But it was basically, think of it like a teeter-totter.	407.68	4.64
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And on one side was the fixed rate, it paid the client.	412.32	4.13
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I think it was like 1%, 3%, 5% per year.	416.45	3.49
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, that was one side.	419.94	1.67
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	On the other side of the teeter-totter was the commission that it paid that advisor.	421.61	6.55
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, it was kind of like 5%, 3%, 1%.	428.16	2.43
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, basically, if you paid the client 5%, the advisor made 1%, and it was just like	430.59	4.54
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	3% and 3% was in the middle.	435.13	2.08
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And then if you paid 1%, the advisor made the high commission.	437.21	4.03
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: That’s a fiduciary nightmare.	441.24	2.91
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That’s a fiduciary nightmare right there.	444.15	2.48
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Yeah.	446.63	1.22
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, I mean, this product doesn’t even exist.	447.85	3.06
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But back in 2007, it did.	450.91	2.909
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And it was incredible and scary to me, unfortunately, at the time, how many advisors, insurance	453.819	9.711
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	agents pick the high commission at the detriment of their clients.	463.53	6.08
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I know your all’s journey through the captive group that you came in, you had a	469.61	5.589
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	set shelf of limited products that you all were offered, but you didn’t know any better	475.199	4.5
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	at the time.	479.699	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It was just kind of like, here’s what we were trained as 20-something-year-olds to	480.699	3.661
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	basically offer our clients, and you were just doing the best you could.	484.36	2.809
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, that was kind of the first eye opener to me when I first got in the industry that	487.169	4.891
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	there are call it salespeople and there are financial planners and they aren’t all created	492.06	5.5
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	equal.	497.56	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, I won’t go too long, but that was kind of the first story where I remember like,	498.56	3.72
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	oh, this is not what I expected.	502.28	1.79
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Well, Keith, remember, that’s where Keith and I met.	504.07	2.55
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	In 2001, 2002, we’re at a captive company that you were only allowed to offer their	506.62	6.359
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	stuff, if you will.	512.979	1.19
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Like whatever they offered, you had to offer it.	514.169	2.011
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: You had a shelf of four or five different products and you went to	516.18	4.21
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Mr. and Mrs. Joneses house and you tried to fit that square peg in a round hole or that	520.39	4.99
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	shoe on that foot, even though it wasn’t the right size.	525.38	3.38
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That’s how you’re trained, in my opinion, in some of these captive agencies.	528.76	4.88
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And like Derek said, that’s where we started, which I think was a good place to start because	533.64	5.73
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	it kind of gives you, I guess, in my opinion, the worst side of the industry.	539.37	5.93
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: 100%.	545.3	1.389
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And then, all of a sudden, you go into every job with just a hammer and a wrench.	546.689	4.531
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, if the windows need cleaning, you got to hit it with a hammer, right?	551.22	5.41
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, it doesn’t make sense.	556.63	1.41
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: I would use the wrench.	558.04	2.19
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Yeah.	560.23	1.18
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith would definitely use the wrench.	561.41	2.35
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, people are like how did you start so young, 23, 24, or 25 years old, because in 2003,	563.76	6.22
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	we’d already been working for that company for a year or two.	569.98	3.26
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And once we realized there was a lot more options out there that were better for the	573.24	6.339
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	clients, it was like, all right, we have to move on.	579.579	1.521
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	We don’t know what that looks like, but we have to move on.	581.1	2.5
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: Yeah, I would say this company kept a pretty good way or they were pretty	583.6	7.929
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	good at keeping the blinders on, keeping the curtain down so we couldn’t look behind	591.529	3.091
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	it to know that there were other products or other opportunities.	594.62	5.469
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	They were actually a heck of a lot better for our investors, our clients, and the people	600.089	5.771
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	that we served.	605.86	1.49
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And like Derek said, once we found out that there was– because we were young, naive,	607.35	5.58
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	coming out of college, just thirsty to learn the industry, and then to be thrown into that	612.93	3.89
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	environment, it was, like I said, a very, very important learning experience.	616.82	5.13
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But looking back on it, it’s like, oh, you wish you had known everything so you could	621.95	5.329
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	have done better by the client.	627.279	1.141
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Yeah, it’s like you didn’t know what you didn’t know.	628.42	3.46
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: Exactly, exactly.	631.88	1.199
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: I had an advisor, and this is one of the things, guys, that I was just–	633.079	4.391
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	obviously, I met you guys a long time ago and it was cool to really grow up in the business	637.47	4.13
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	as you all evolved and grew your business and were able to serve a lot more clients	641.6	4.22
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	in your marketplace, grow the team.	645.82	1.949
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But that was in my chair, I kind of had this 30,000-foot view.	647.769	4.971
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I personally was working with hundreds of financial services firms across the country,	652.74	4.55
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and then the company I worked for was working with thousands.	657.29	3.81
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, I just kind of say I had an accelerated learning curve, and so I could really see	661.1	4.94
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	kind of the landscape of the independent financial advisory space.	666.04	3.68
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I guess, just to not assume when we say captive, an independent captive, really, how	669.72	7.89
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I would define that, it’s kind of working for a mothership.	677.61	3.969
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	We’ve all seen the commercials on TV where it’s this company or that company, there’s	681.579	5.221
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	another name over the door versus independent, obviously, you all as entrepreneurs created	686.8	6.74
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and built SHP.	693.54	1.65
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And then, typically, a very defining difference between a captive organization in finance	695.19	6.54
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and an independent is the product selection.	701.73	3.71
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And one of the things, the analogies I heard one advisor share, he’s like, you know,	705.44	4.23
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	when you go into a quick shop and you’re like, you need some laundry detergent and	709.67	4.859
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	what are you guys’ quick shops on the East Coast?	714.529	1.921
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	We’ve got like…	716.45	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: Cumberland Farms, maybe.	717.45	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: 7-Eleven.	718.45	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: Yeah, 7-Elevens up here.	719.45	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: So, call it like a 7-Eleven.	720.45	3.49
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I go into a 7-Eleven, I’m in a pinch, and I need some laundry detergent.	723.94	4.209
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You’re going to have two options maybe, and it’s going to be the smaller bottle	728.149	4.951
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	at the more expensive price, typically, like the Tide or whatever they’re carrying.	733.1	5.01
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And with a captive group that just oftentimes what happens is it’s like there’s only	738.11	6.49
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	so much bandwidth because they have to train their group on distributing certain products,	744.6	5.9
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and so, they can’t train them on everything.	750.5	1.68
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, it’s like, let’s pick two or three and let’s distribute those, where the analogy	752.18	5.04
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	of an independent advisor would be like going into Wal-Mart and looking at what’s that	757.22	4.369
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	shelf space when you look at laundry detergent, you’re going to have everyone you’ve ever	761.589	3.711
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	heard of and probably 15 you have it because it’s just what I would call open architecture	765.3	7.46
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	when it comes to solutions.	772.76	2.079
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I don’t know if you guys want to go into kind of the concept of fiduciary and	774.839	5.141
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	how that plays in, but I think those two kind of go hand in hand with independent, captive,	779.98	4.64
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and then fiduciary and how I think our industry markets that versus the definition, I think,	784.62	5.149
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	that might be helpful to your audience.	789.769	1.291
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: And before we get into that, I would say, Brad, the evolution was first	791.06	5.019
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	to, like you said, not just be captive to certain things to offer to clients.	796.079	6.5
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That was our decision back in– that was 20 years ago in 2003.	802.579	3.241
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Then, as we started building, it was like great, we can offer everything and anything	805.82	4.259
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	to our clients, which is great.	810.079	2.181
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But then around 2010, 2011, 2012, we said, “You know what?	812.26	2.96
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That’s great, but that’s only part of investment and income plan.	815.22	4.24
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That’s only a part of a financial plan.”	819.46	2.569
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, I think the evolvement from after we met you in around ‘11 or so, like ’12, ‘13,	822.029	7.75
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	‘14 was the growth and evolving of the SHP Retirement Road Map.	829.779	5.221
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And instead of just having the best access to all the investment tools which we do and	835.0	5.22
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	we did, then it was like, all right, well that’s one piece of the puzzle, but what	840.22	3.45
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	are we doing for tax planning?	843.67	2.599
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	How are we evolving that into our clients’ plans?	846.269	2.461
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Do we have a proper estate plan attorney to coordinate estate plans?	848.73	4.36
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	How about Medicare, long-term care?	853.09	3.01
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	When can I retire?	856.1	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Am I going to run out of money?	857.1	1.179
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, there’s…	858.279	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: Decisions around Social Security, when to take it?	859.279	1.571
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You know what I mean?	860.85	1.39
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	There’s so much that goes into this.	862.24	1.39
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: So, I think, as you mentioned, it’s like when someone’s looking for an	863.63	5.91
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	advisor, and as you mentioned, there’s captive versus independent.	869.54	4.31
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And then, okay, you’re independent, but what do you really do?	873.85	2.659
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You’re a small company that can only offer a few products and vehicles, maybe even your	876.509	5.591
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	fiduciary, but what are you actually really doing for that client from a full holistic	882.1	3.99
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	planning perspective?	886.09	1.15
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, it’s like everyone can have a similar designation, but what that firm does for their	887.24	5.32
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	clients, as you know, dealing with hundreds of advisors or probably thousands over the	892.56	3.74
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	years, it’s very, very different.	896.3	2.45
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, back to the fiduciary conversation, Brad, obviously, we’re held to the fiduciary standard,	898.75	5.769
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	act in the best interests of your clients ahead of your own situation, right?	904.519	4.38
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And some people almost market that.	908.899	1.601
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	If you watch commercials, it’s like, yep, we’re a fiduciary.	910.5	4.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That means you should come to us, right?	914.5	1.92
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Guys, I literally just saw a commercial this weekend.	916.42	4.56
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And my guess is many of the retirees or soon-to-be retirees or whoever is listening to this podcast	920.98	6.14
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	has seen the exact same commercial.	927.12	2.56
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Just write it down, write the word fiduciary down, and then watch the next financial services	929.68	5.019
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	commercial, and I bet, half of them are using it.	934.699	3.991
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But here’s the thing, they’re using it as a marketing angle versus the definition	938.69	5.899
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	of what a fiduciary actually is.	944.589	2.231
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I just pulled it up because I wanted to get one definition.	946.82	3.97
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	A fiduciary is someone who manages money or property for someone else.	950.79	4.109
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	When you are named a fiduciary, you are required by law to manage the person’s money and	954.899	4.501
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	property for their benefit, not yours.	959.4	2.16
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	For example, a friend of yours may name you her fiduciary through a power of attorney.	961.56	5.259
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, that’s very short and sweet.	966.819	3.46
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But here’s what’s interesting.	970.279	2.8
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I’ve seen this, and by the way, a Series 65, we’re getting a little into the weeds,	973.079	5.231
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	but a Series 65 means, which obviously, the guys are Keith and Derek and their team, it	978.31	6.611
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	allows you to charge a fee for financial planning.	984.921	3.598
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	One of the things that comes along with it is the requirement to be a fiduciary, right?	988.519	4.25
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, legally act in the best interest of your clients.	992.769	3.201
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, by definition, I’m legally obligated to act in the best interest of my clients.	995.97	6.359
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Now, let’s talk about the marketing spend that our industry puts on it.	1002.329	4.221
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It’s basically work with the fiduciary and no one else.	1006.55	4.979
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Now, the problem is, I’m going to go back to your guys’ analogy of the tools in the	1011.529	5.101
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	toolbox.	1016.63	1.85
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And one of the things I’ve found to be very true, in fact, as I’ve talked with retirees,	1018.48	4.19
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	as I’ve talked with advisors, it’s almost universal.	1022.67	3.37
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I’m just going to say, “Hey, I hire you to build a home for me.”	1026.04	4.34
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And if I’m the general contractor for your home and I open up my toolbox, I’m like,	1030.38	5.01
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	“Hey, guys, this can be an incredible home.	1035.39	2.27
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Can’t wait to build it.”	1037.66	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I pull out a hammer.	1038.66	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You’re like, “Awesome, cool.”	1039.66	1.049
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Yeah, we’re going to have to hammer some nails in.	1040.709	2.231
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Absolutely.	1042.94	1.55
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But then if you look in the toolbox and all that’s in there are hammers, you’re like,	1044.49	5.12
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	“Hey, where’s the rest of the tools?	1049.61	2.98
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And how sound of a structure are we going to be able to construct with just hammers?”	1052.59	5.35
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And that could trade out a hammer for a saw or a wrench or whatever.	1057.94	4.55
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, one of the things I see is there’s this war.	1062.49	3.41
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It’s almost like going on Facebook and scrolling right versus left politics.	1065.9	4.03
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But in the world of finance, it’s fee-based versus insurance-based planning.	1069.93	8.879
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And just swap those two terms out for here’s a hammer on one side, here’s a saw on the	1078.809	5.001
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	other.	1083.81	1.8
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And truth be told, I strongly believe a fiduciary if you’re actually going to deliver on the	1085.61	6.74
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	term fiduciary, you should open up the toolbox and ideally have every financial product,	1092.35	6.77
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	every tool in this analogy possible in that toolbox to serve your clients.	1099.12	5.939
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I think one of the things that happens on a lot of these, whether it’s– I see	1105.059	3.512
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	a lot in the AUM-based world, hey, we’re a fiduciary.	1108.571	4.429
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	We’re legally obligated to do what’s in your best interest.	1113.0	3.78
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And then you’re like, okay, cool.	1116.78	1.24
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	What sort of insurance planning do you do?	1118.02	1.26
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And they’re like, we don’t do insurance planning.	1119.28	1.83
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Like, wait, you work with retirees, and how do you not have life insurance options or	1121.11	5.63
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	income-based solutions, annuities, other products that you can– these are tools that were	1126.74	4.95
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	designed to solve for that need.	1131.69	3.4
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Or on the flip side, if you go on the insurance side and there’s not fee-based, it’s like	1135.09	4.2
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	wait, definitely get the protections that insurance allows, but my guess is they also	1139.29	4.96
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	want to grow some assets as well, keep up with inflation.	1144.25	2.799
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Maybe they’ve got extra in the portfolio that they just want to grow that aligns with	1147.049	5.401
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	their risk tolerance, all that.	1152.45	2.69
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, if I’m just going to circle back, I think one of the things as a retiree, if	1155.14	5.87
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	somebody says, “Hey, I’m a fiduciary, I’m obligated to do what’s in your best	1161.01	5.549
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	interest,” I would say, “Hey, let’s open up the toolbox of tools.	1166.559	4.141
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	What all solutions do you offer?	1170.7	1.66
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	What are your insurance solutions?	1172.36	1.809
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	What are your fee-based solutions?”	1174.169	2.071
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And literally, because you can say you’re a fiduciary and you can legally be a fiduciary,	1176.24	4.65
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	licensed to be one, the question is what’s in the toolbox?	1180.89	3.57
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Because if they don’t have the solutions in the toolbox or they haven’t trained,	1184.46	3.25
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	been trained to offer a broad breadth of solutions, then it’s like I’m a fiduciary with one	1187.71	6.77
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	tool.	1194.48	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And we know how that works out, right?	1195.48	1.63
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, anyway, that’s kind of the stance I’ve looked at that’s been eye opening over the	1197.11	4.401
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	last 10, 15 years.	1201.511	1.019
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Well, I would say those same things.	1202.53	2.42
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That’s really good points, Brad, but on the same token, you have those same commercials	1204.95	3.8
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and people that market that they’re a fiduciary, right?	1208.75	2.68
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But we assume if we get our 65, technically, we’re fiduciaries, many, many years ago.	1211.43	5.08
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, this is how I always thought about it.	1216.51	2.39
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And obviously, this is the difference between the CFP standard maybe and being a fiduciary,	1218.9	4.25
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	but if you’re a fiduciary and you can just put someone in, like let’s say you run a	1223.15	4.83
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	commercial, people call, you do a risk questionnaire.	1227.98	2.8
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Oh, you’re moderate, okay, you’re going to go in our moderate portfolio.	1230.78	3.47
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Done.	1234.25	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That’s being technically on paper, right?	1235.25	1.679
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That’s being a fiduciary.	1236.929	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You have your license.	1237.929	1.291
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	They filled out a risk score.	1239.22	1.339
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	They end up moderate.	1240.559	1.381
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You put them in a moderate portfolio, you rebalance it, and you manage it.	1241.94	4.13
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It’s good.	1246.07	1.44
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	My point is like, what I think the biggest thing that a good advisor, a good advisory	1247.51	6.13
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	firm, it’s independent, differentiates themselves, is having that just be one piece of the practice.	1253.64	5.62
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	What I always say is ask your advisor, what are you doing that you’re not necessarily	1259.26	3.85
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	getting paid for?	1263.11	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It sounds like a crazy question.	1264.11	1.36
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Well, obviously, I’m going to pay someone to do the work, but like how, if you look	1265.47	3.79
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	at the SHP model, we’re paid to manage clients’ portfolios and so forth.	1269.26	4.62
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But with that, we’re also building clients have access to a full portal, the amazing	1273.88	5.24
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	technology suite, right?	1279.12	1.36
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And this isn’t to brag about.	1280.48	1.199
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I’m just saying they have a full plan on income, cash flow, taxes, health care, estate	1281.679	5.821
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	planning, all this is being built out as a full plan.	1287.5	2.96
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, I would take it one step further and say, because so many people that say they’re	1290.46	4.7
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	fiduciaries would never even have a conversation about proactive tax planning.	1295.16	3.7
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I’m not talking about tax returns, I’m talking about, hey, if the tax code looks	1298.86	3.33
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	like it might go up and you have a lot of money in IRAs and 401(k)s that you have paid	1302.19	4.63
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	$0 in taxes in, are we just going to let that sit and then deal with it when you’re 73	1306.82	5.39
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	years old and RMDs come out?	1312.21	2.54
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And now, it’s putting you into a higher bracket, which might even be higher than it	1314.75	2.94
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	is now and your Medicare premiums might be higher.	1317.69	2.619
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Is that being a fiduciary?	1320.309	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I guess it is.	1321.309	1.75
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But my point is that true advising needs to go so much more beyond that, in my opinion.	1323.059	5.451
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: It needs to go beyond stocks, bonds, mutual funds.	1328.51	2.1
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Exactly.	1330.61	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: It needs to be holistic, like Derek was saying.	1331.61	2.99
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I always think of it as like five gears in this retirement machine and all the gears	1334.6	6.809
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	need to be working together to make sure the plan is working – income, investments, taxes,	1341.409	4.62
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	health care, and legacy.	1346.029	1.511
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And if one of those gears is broken, if one of those gears isn’t up to date, if one	1347.54	3.6
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	of those gears is not even being looked at, then you don’t have a full plan.	1351.14	5.52
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That machine, like I said, is not working.	1356.66	1.6
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I don’t know if that’s the best analogy, but that’s kind of the way I use it.	1358.26	2.649
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: And Brad, you know, Keith, Matt, and myself and Michelle, kind of our	1360.909	4.031
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	leadership team here, we’ve been working on the same team for 10 years almost in terms	1364.94	4.75
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	of that particular because we hired Michelle as our COO and we mentally grind on ways to	1369.69	6.08
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	provide more value.	1375.77	3.54
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And obviously, it’s a lot different than where it was 10 years ago, 15 years ago.	1379.31	4.72
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It takes firms a while to get to the point where they can offer true advice, but a lot	1384.03	4.22
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	of people will ask, well, how come your team is so big?	1388.25	2.45
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Why do you have 45, 50 people?	1390.7	2.469
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I think going back to that same thing, in order to deliver on a true fiduciary-based	1393.169	5.76
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	plan, if you use a CFP model, which we have a few CFPs in our team here at SHP, to have	1398.929	8.351
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	that planning, you need a planning team.	1407.28	1.879
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You need a team that can manage portfolios.	1409.159	2.111
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You need an investment committee.	1411.27	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You need an operations team.	1412.27	1.159
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You need a new business team.	1413.429	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You need a business development team.	1414.429	1.121
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: You need people to help you execute.	1415.55	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Correct.	1416.55	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: That’s really what it is.	1417.55	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: I could never on my own sit here and do the type of planning we offer	1418.55	2.629
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	to our clients.	1421.179	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	If it was just me, there’s no way, unless I have two clients, and…	1422.179	3.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: It’s impossible.	1425.179	1.11
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: So, a lot of times, a lot of advisors, they just keep scaling, scaling,	1426.289	3.701
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	scaling, and growing.	1429.99	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	If you’re not growing your team to support that and building the value, then are you	1430.99	3.789
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	really providing the best value to your clients?	1434.779	2.351
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You know what I mean?	1437.13	2.86
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Yeah.	1439.99	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I think I borrowed this from you guys.	1440.99	1.89
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Do you have a portfolio?	1442.88	1.169
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Or do you have a plan?	1444.049	1.88
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And if you look at what’s very common based on many of the offices we work with nationwide,	1445.929	8.331
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	is oftentimes a retiree will come into their office with– they’ve done the work, they’ve	1454.26	5.19
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	done what they were supposed to do.	1459.45	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	They were diligent, they saved, they invested, and maybe they have half a mil, maybe they	1460.45	5.24
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	have a mil, maybe they have two mil or more.	1465.69	3.25
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And in reality, once you peel back the onion, it’s a basket of stocks that’s diversified,	1468.94	7.24
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	but the analogy I’ll make a lot is many retirees are only seeing half of the picture.	1476.18	6.35
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	If you say you’ve got this lifelong goal of I want to climb Mount Everest, I want to	1482.53	5.96
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	make it to the peak, many retirees do the same thing with their money.	1488.49	4.54
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I want to get a million dollars in the nest egg, $2 million in the nest egg.	1493.03	2.749
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And it’s kind of this big number that’s like this goal, the summit in their mind.	1495.779	4.941
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	The thing is, once they make it to the peak, guess what?	1500.72	2.81
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Mount Everest, you have to make it down to the base.	1503.53	2.66
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And weird statistic is more people actually perish on the way down than the way up because	1506.19	3.66
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	they haven’t adequately planned for the second half of the journey.	1509.85	3.13
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I think it’s a really interesting analogy when you look at retirees because they’ve	1512.98	4.16
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	worked on all the accumulation piece, which is the working years, where, by the way, we	1517.14	4.01
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	have a recent market downturn, like all of us have recently experienced here.	1521.15	3.59
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That’s okay because I’ve got the paycheck and it just keeps– I live off the paycheck	1524.74	4.49
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	in my working years.	1529.23	1.04
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Well, once you retire, and now, I’ve got the million-dollar nest egg if the million-dollar	1530.27	5.11
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	nest egg is now an 800k nest egg or a 700k nest egg because of market exposure, uh-oh,	1535.38	7.66
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	as a retiree, I’m in trouble now.	1543.04	1.39
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It’s kind of hard to go back and retro fix that.	1544.43	3.51
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, as you guys look and you solve for income, there is no such thing as retirement	1547.94	4.839
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	without income, you need that foundational base.	1552.779	2.821
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And most retirees, unfortunately, don’t have pensions these days.	1555.6	3.03
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, you create that income base.	1558.63	1.67
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Then you’ve got the growth of investments on top of it.	1560.3	2.52
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But guess what?	1562.82	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	We can do those two really well.	1563.82	2.16
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And let’s just say my imaginary advisor makes me an extra 5% per year compared to	1565.98	4.949
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	the guy down the road.	1570.929	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Well, if I’m paying 20% more in taxes because I don’t have a tax plan, proactive tax planning,	1571.929	5.37
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	none of that matters anyway.	1577.299	1.591
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, to your guys’ point, it all works together.	1578.89	4.25
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And if you focus in on one or two of those pieces of the pie and ignore the other three,	1583.14	5.73
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	by the way, that can come back to bite you really hard.	1588.87	2.48
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, as you guys have built out your team, one of the things that I’ve seen evolve	1591.35	5.39
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	is to build a true holistic financial plan built on a CFP standard and check all the	1596.74	4.99
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	boxes.	1601.73	1.42
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It can’t be done with the solo advisor because there’s so much to take into account.	1603.15	4.85
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Like your guy Nick that oversees the planning team, I mean, that guy is like a black belt	1608.0	6.14
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	ninja in eMoney, your financial planning software, for those that aren’t familiar.	1614.14	5.36
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And it’s insane to see the level we were talking not that long ago last week.	1619.5	6.72
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And he’s going into scenarios that I’ve never even dreamed up and testing for those.	1626.22	5.16
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, to your guys’ point, you had to have a team if you were going to deliver on the	1631.38	3.28
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	promise of true holistic financial planning.	1634.66	2.52
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I love that you guys have invested in your company to actually build out the team	1637.18	4.51
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	in order to deliver on that.	1641.69	1.03
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Well, I think you have to.	1642.72	2.31
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You really have to deliver that true plan.	1645.03	2.22
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I think that’s what leads to clients telling their friends and the referrals.	1647.25	4.23
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It’s just doing the planning and doing what we say we’re going to do from the beginning	1651.48	3.01
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and living up to what we promised each client.	1654.49	2.98
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And one of the things I love doing and exercise, if we have a real plan because my thought	1657.47	5.74
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	is like maybe I’m a little more uptight and OCD type– I’m like, if I’m on a	1663.21	5.99
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	vacation…	1669.2	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Derek, you are.	1670.2	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You are.	1671.2	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: I’m 100%.	1672.2	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But if let’s say I’m on vacation somewhere and I’m retired, and maybe you could probably	1673.2	6.05
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	get away with this, Brad, but I wouldn’t be able to sit there and be like, I have a	1679.25	4.09
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	good– like if I feel like a lot of things in my retirement plan where I’m not being	1683.34	2.99
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	taken care of, that could be, that weren’t being fully looked at, or even around taxes,	1686.33	4.43
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	like if I have all this money in 401(k)s, no one’s ever talk to me about taxes, that	1690.76	3.691
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	would just bother me, right?	1694.451	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, I like to make sure all the i’s are dotted and t’s are crossed.	1695.451	3.429
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	For me, it’s everything, but for everyone, it should be at least for your financial plan.	1698.88	4.52
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And once you have a plan where everything is built out properly, meaning we have a portal	1703.4	4.83
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	that lets our clients know what their income is going to be, what their Social Security,	1708.23	4.79
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	their work, their projected returns.	1713.02	2.269
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Then, this is the cool part, what I love being able to do with our clients is showing them	1715.289	5.361
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	what’s possible because a lot of times, they say, I would like to be great if I could	1720.65	6.3
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	do one vacation a year, nothing too fancy because we don’t want to spend our money	1726.95	4.36
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	down.	1731.31	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But it would be great if I could do one vacation a year, maybe bring our grandkids once every	1732.31	2.999
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	three years, and then we look at their plan, it’s like, “Hey, Joe and Mary, do you	1735.309	5.451
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	know that you could do that every year, three times a year and still be fine?”	1740.76	3.94
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I mean, like, what?	1744.7	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, a lot of people, like you said, try to get to this number, then they don’t have	1745.7	2.64
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	a plan.	1748.34	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, they’re not sure how much they should be spending or what they can do.	1749.34	2.86
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, it’s like, I love that– here’s covering your base plan is easy, and obviously, every	1752.2	5.54
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	scenario is different, but this happens a lot.	1757.74	2.069
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	However, here’s what’s possible, here’s what you could live off and still not worry	1759.809	4.25
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	about running out of money down the road.	1764.059	1.781
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, that’s cool to see for clients to be able to see the impact of the planning that’s	1765.84	4.429
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	allowing them to live their fullest life in retirement.	1770.269	4.451
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	We love seeing the outcome of that type of scenario.	1774.72	3.57
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: I love that.	1778.29	2.21
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	A mentor actually shared that question with me one time.	1780.5	4.14
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Any time you’re faced with something, ask yourself the question, what could this make	1784.64	4.83
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	possible?	1789.47	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, if I was a retiree listening in right now, what could having a super dialed in financial	1790.47	5.77
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	plan make possible?	1796.24	1.46
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I know one of the things we’ve talked a lot about is being an advisor, being a financial	1797.7	6.979
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	advisor by title, by licensing, hundreds of thousands of posts in the United States of	1804.679	5.851
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	America.	1810.53	1.17
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	What most retirees need from my experience is somebody that helps lead their financial	1811.7	5.359
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	lives.	1817.059	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	They need leadership, they need mentorship.	1818.059	2.71
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	They need someone when it gets crazy, like the recent market conditions, let’s be honest,	1820.769	7.76
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	a therapist some days, if I’m waking up and I’m stressed out, I can’t sleep well	1828.529	3.53
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	at night.	1832.059	1.74
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And what’s really cool to see how you guys approach it is you’re helping retirees spend	1833.799	11.591
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	with confidence, but there’s no worse travesty.	1845.39	3.539
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I mean, I wasn’t planning on sharing the story, but I’m going to share it because	1848.929	2.511
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	it just came to mind.	1851.44	1.359
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	My wife’s grandma, so she was a Catholic school teacher her whole life and she grew	1852.799	7.12
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	up in the Great Depression.	1859.919	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, she was the type that would literally save the pennies and not a lavish lifestyle,	1860.919	7.031
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	tiny house, Salina, Kansas, not a high cost of living.	1867.95	5.69
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And she was the type of Catholic that would go to church Wednesday, Sunday, probably slip	1873.64	5.259
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	a Saturday in there too, like multiple times a week.	1878.899	3.421
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And her one goal in life was to go visit the Vatican in Rome, Italy.	1882.32	6.37
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And unfortunately, she passed away, never checked off that bucket list item.	1888.69	6.209
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And Sarah’s mom, my mother-in-law, like that just ate away at her because that was	1894.899	5.431
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	her mom’s lifelong goal.	1900.33	2.39
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	She died with over $60,000 in the bank that was distributed to her kids.	1902.72	6.04
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so that, to me, is the saddest retirement story.	1908.76	4.83
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	The funds were there.	1913.59	1.53
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	She could have taken multiple, she could have taken the most lavish trip to Italy ever.	1915.12	7.09
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And because the planning was not in place, because the prioritization was not in place,	1922.21	4.559
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	because it was kind of like, well, what if rainy days?	1926.769	4.02
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I’m here to tell you, you guys do this all the time, it’s possible with proper planning	1930.789	4.091
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	to say, “Hey, here is the vacation fund every year.”	1934.88	3.96
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It’s almost contractually locked in.	1938.84	2.559
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You don’t have to think about it.	1941.399	1.301
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	The market goes up, down, sideways.	1942.7	2.14
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It’s literally built into the planning.	1944.84	2.75
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And to me, if I’m a retiree out there, and this is my own personal view, there’s a	1947.59	5.78
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	reason you work hard during your years and raising the kids and grinding.	1953.37	5.12
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I’ve got three kiddos at home.	1958.49	2.05
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I know some days, it’s like, man, this is just a grind.	1960.54	3.42
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I had somebody once told me the days are long and the years are short as a parent.	1963.96	6.53
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I want to make sure once my wife and I are empty nesters and we have a lot of traveling	1970.49	9.08
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	aspirations, I will absolutely have a plan in place that it isn’t even second thought,	1979.57	4.88
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	it’s like, where are we going this month?	1984.45	1.68
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Where are we going next month?	1986.13	2.169
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And the cool thing is, with proper financial planning, and I know we’ve shared some of	1988.299	3.391
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	these stories privately, not only is it possible.	1991.69	3.8
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	To your point there, like you said, some people are like, well, every three years.	1995.49	3.53
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You’re like, no, the math works out.	1999.02	1.389
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You could take three of these trips a year if you want it.	2000.409	2.111
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Yeah, exactly.	2002.52	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Because the planning’s in place, right?	2003.52	1.409
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, just clarity is the key.	2004.929	2.401
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I think that’s awesome.	2007.33	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You guys provide that by having proper planning in place.	2008.33	2.36
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: And I’ll share, I know we got to run soon.	2010.69	2.512
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Actually, one of the stories that was pretty impactful that we had a client spend with	2013.202	3.128
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	us a few years.	2016.33	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And when they came on board, we kind of went through the scenario of what’s possible	2017.33	3.849
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and they actually retired in their 50s.	2021.179	1.49
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It was pretty cool.	2022.669	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	They retired early.	2023.669	1.47
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And on that theme of what’s possible, they went on a trip and I don’t remember where.	2025.139	4.571
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It might have been Italy, but it was wherever they ended up, there was a spot where they	2029.71	3.8
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	took some sort of a tram or something to the top of the mountain.	2033.51	3.99
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And then for the last, I don’t want to say quarter mile, there was a certain amount of	2037.5	3.429
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	steps you had to get to the very, very top to this peak ultimate view.	2040.929	5.421
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, as they were about to go up, they met this couple that was older than them in	2046.35	4.42
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	their late 70s, and they talked to the couple, like they get to know each other.	2050.77	4.45
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	They had these last several steps to get to this top peak and they said, “Hey, let’s	2055.22	4.149
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	go up together.	2059.369	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Let’s just do this together.”	2060.369	1.24
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And this other couple said, “No, we’re not going to be able to make it.”	2061.609	3.921
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	“Come on, let’s go.”	2065.53	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And they said, “You know what?	2066.53	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	If I had one regret, we were so nervous about running out of money that we waited to travel	2067.53	4.5
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	so long that now that we’re here, we physically can’t get to the top.”	2072.03	4.41
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, kudos to you, as you were saying to our clients for actually taking the time and	2076.44	7.28
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	getting it to the top because, in all seriousness, that was like they took it to heart.	2083.72	5.75
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That was a story I heard many years ago, and it stuck with me like, don’t wait.	2089.47	3.97
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And obviously, some people just might not be able to afford it.	2093.44	3.26
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But if you have a financial plan in place and you’re able to do so or you’re not	2096.7	3.66
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	sure, make sure you’re having that conversation of what is possible because you get one life,	2100.36	5.64
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and like you said, it’s a quick one and whatever it is that you want to do, charities	2106.0	4.619
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	you want to support, whatever it is, could be charities, could be mission trips, could	2110.619	3.521
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	be travel, could be grandkids, could be golf, could be all of the above, you want to know	2114.14	4.83
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	what’s possible.	2118.97	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And that’s what I think I should sit with everyone.	2119.97	2.3
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And to know what’s possible, it doesn’t just take having all the products and having	2122.27	4.96
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	all the options.	2127.23	1.07
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It isn’t just being independent versus captive.	2128.3	2.6
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	To me, it takes true financial planning, not just fiduciary.	2130.9	4.13
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Take it one step further – income, investments, taxes, health care, estate planning.	2135.03	4.74
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, any last…	2139.77	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Well, the truth is, Derek, you can’t take it with you.	2140.77	4.16
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, either make sure you leave it behind to a person, a cause, church charity to your	2144.93	6.87
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	point, or you should probably spend it while you’re here and enjoy it.	2151.8	4.24
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	To me, money is just a vehicle that allows you to create experiences with those that	2156.04	4.35
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	you love.	2160.39	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It’s just a tool.	2161.39	1.03
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I had one of my clients actually, this was like 10 years ago on that exact conversation.	2162.42	6.6
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	He says, “My goal is to retire a little bit more each year, not slave away for 40	2169.02	5.47
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	years,” and then not be the couple that can’t make it all the way up the mountain	2174.49	5.599
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	in Italy.	2180.089	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That was the bucket list thing.	2181.089	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And it’s easy– I mean, it’s possible with proper planning.	2182.089	4.761
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	As a 50-some-year-old, 40-some-year-old, you can start creating those experiences and they	2186.85	5.72
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	can just be long weekend, start now as you grow the nest egg.	2192.57	3.12
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	But it’s all about priority and putting the big rocks on the calendar that matter.	2195.69	3.36
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: Yeah.	2199.05	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And on the don’t wait front, I had a client call me when we were out on our adventure	2200.05	6.319
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and he had a heart attack.	2206.369	2.25
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And unfortunately, thank God now recovered, but when I met with him three years ago and	2208.619	8.5
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I’ve continued to meet with him ongoing, he just wanted to push, push, push through	2217.119	3.561
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	work.	2220.68	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I said, you need to take some time and enjoy life and enjoy what are some things?	2221.68	3.56
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	He always wanted to go to the Amalfi Coast, Italy.	2225.24	2.609
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I know we’ve talked a lot about Italy, really promoting that vacation.	2227.849	2.741
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Actually, Italy was…	2230.59	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Amalfi Coast, he should go yesterday.	2231.59	2.51
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It’s amazing.	2234.1	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: So, needless to say, he goes through his heart surgery and then calls	2235.1	5.1
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	me and he goes, “Keith, I need to take some money out of the accounts.	2240.2	3.669
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I’m finally going to listen to you.”	2243.869	2.821
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I said, “You can’t get back health, you can’t get back time.	2246.69	4.419
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You got to do it while you can.”	2251.109	1.951
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, we sent out the check late last week.	2253.06	2.71
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I can’t wait to get the pictures.	2255.77	1.63
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: I love it.	2257.4	1.82
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Our most finite resource, and I think a lot of people think it’s money, it’s time.	2259.22	4.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: Definitely time.	2263.22	1.23
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: And you talk to somebody that’s in poor health or towards the end of their	2264.45	3.56
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	journey on this planet, and they’ll all say, I’d spend all the money in the account	2268.01	4.19
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	to get my health back or time back.	2272.2	1.869
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: Absolutely.	2274.069	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: And so, don’t take it for granted while you got it.	2275.069	2.3
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	That’s for sure.	2277.369	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: Well, even though you bashed me about being uptight, even though I was	2278.369	3.371
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	the one who brought it up, you’re not supposed to agree with me.	2281.74	2.74
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	We do appreciate.	2284.48	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Keith Ellis, Jr.: I do too.	2285.48	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Derek Gregoire: I know all these– yeah, I’m going to get back later.	2286.48	1.49
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	All these years of– back in the day, I know you guys believe in us long term.	2287.97	6.02
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And so, a vision of our company, we were just six or seven of us here.	2293.99	4.36
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, obviously, we really appreciate that and all the support ongoing, and your friendship	2298.35	5.99
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	and everything else means a lot to us.	2304.34	1.97
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, thank you.	2306.31	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Brad Johnson: Well, guys, on my side, it’s been an awesome journey.	2307.31	3.809
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	We all met each other as 20-something-year-olds, young in this business.	2311.119	4.621
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And I feel really, really fortunate to have been able to just be beside you guys watching	2315.74	6.82
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	the journey play out.	2322.56	1.57
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And one of the things– I have an opportunity to work with hundreds of financial services	2324.13	5.56
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	offices over 15 years now.	2329.69	2.27
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	I’m not the young guy in the business anymore.	2331.96	1.859
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	One thing that always stood out with just SHP, I know I’ve got the two of you and	2333.819	4.78
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	Matt, Michelle, and you’ve got a great team around you all, it was just the heart.	2338.599	5.76
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	The heart, you guys cared, and that’s something you can’t fake.	2344.359	4.361
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And that, I believe if I really look at where all of this came from and how it’s evolved,	2348.72	4.37
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	you guys cared.	2353.09	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You cared more about your clients and retirees than you did, trying to make this or that.	2354.09	6.9
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	It was just like, it’s a testament to like the Zig Ziglar, you help enough other people	2360.99	5.61
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	get what they want.	2366.6	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	You’ll get what you want.	2367.6	1.0
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And to me, that’s been SHP’s journey is it’s just a testament of you’ve helped	2368.6	3.18
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	a lot of retirees in your marketplace get those goals checked off for their retirement.	2371.78	6.33
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	And because of that, your company has grown and benefited.	2378.11	2.79
01yaQt92ta0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yaQt92ta0	So, humbled to have been along for the ride.	2380.9	2.71

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	bigger topic and has been over the last	236.76	4.74

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	able to use them to accomplish your	249.659	3.66

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	for your questions and then remind you	253.319	3.361
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the next investor updates that we have	255.06	3.72
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	going on	256.68	5.1
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	in regards to the economic environment	258.78	5.88
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that we're in you will see that for GDP	261.78	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	growth which isn't coming out yet I	264.66	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	believe it comes out on the 23rd or the	266.1	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	26th I apologize I think we get the	268.5	5.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fourth quarter GDP numbers in so far	270.78	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it's kind of a plus minus the first two	273.66	3.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	quarters were down slightly third	275.58	4.619
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	quarter was up not too bad it wasn't	277.56	4.079
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	quite what you would hope for but it	280.199	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	wasn't bad making it sort of flat I'll	281.639	4.681
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	show you some information here that's	284.639	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what we sort of expect here in a moment	286.32	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	as we come into out of the fourth	288.479	5.041
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	quarter and then into the new year	290.88	5.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	business profitability has been kind of	293.52	4.98
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	around like all over the charts some	296.04	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	companies doing pretty well some are not	298.5	3.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that's to be expected that does happen	300.54	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	uh as you cycle through sort of a sector	302.36	5.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	rotation of the industries in America	305.34	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	they go through good times and bad times	307.56	3.78
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so at this point I would tend to say	309.66	4.319
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it's been more of a plus minus not a	311.34	5.46
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	minus plus so that's a good sign you	313.979	4.261
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	know unemployment rates still continue	316.8	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to be low uh uh historically low which	318.24	5.04
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	is a wonderful thing and interest rates	321.18	4.799
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	uh have have been rising which is sort	323.28	5.699
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	of challenging in a business environment	325.979	5.94
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	but actually it's quite nice as an	328.979	6.06
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	investor opportunity money markets like	331.919	5.041
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	ours right now are paying between three	335.039	3.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and a half and four and a half percent	336.96	4.079
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	uh that's not bad I don't remember those	338.419	4.961
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	days for quite some time so there are	341.039	4.621
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	pluses there and for those investors who	343.38	3.659
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	are wanting more conservative approach	345.66	3.3
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	kind of miss the days of some better	347.039	3.901
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	interest rate that's a plus for	348.96	3.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	businesses trying to access Capital it's	350.94	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	kind of a minus so I think it's uh it's	352.86	4.559
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	going to be kind of a wash here as we	355.44	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	look at this as a as a choice at this	357.419	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	point so I would say if I'm looking at	359.82	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the four engines on this plane they're	361.979	5.701
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	all firing uh one is firing normally and	364.5	4.979
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the others are kind of in the mix right	367.68	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	now which may speak to how the	369.479	4.741
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	volatility would look here the first uh	371.52	5.76
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and second quarter of this year possibly	374.22	5.28
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	let's take a moment and break down the	377.28	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	markets and see what we we have with	379.5	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that uh because I've got some	381.84	4.919
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	information on the markets themselves so	383.58	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	here we are again let's get rid of this	386.759	3.481
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	I want to talk about inflation in a	388.44	2.94
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	second but I will take a look at the	390.24	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	market so when we look at the the Dow	391.38	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	for instance now this is looking back	394.38	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	over a two-year time frame this to your	395.94	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	time frame we come back here we can see	398.94	4.979
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the high in January of 2022	400.62	5.46
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and then we can see how the Market's	403.919	3.541
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	gone down and for those of you who've	406.08	3.119
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	been on this update a number of times	407.46	5.28
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	you realize that uh uh I've been talking	409.199	6.481
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	about the uh 50-day moving average or	412.74	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	blue line the 200-day moving average or	415.68	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	red line and you can see how this has	417.6	5.159
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	played into it uh we hit kind of a a	419.88	6.3
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	real serious downturn in June of this	422.759	6.06
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	last year grows back up very nicely by	426.18	4.92
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	August took a much bigger hit in	428.819	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	September and October has come back up	431.1	6.48
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and you'll note that it has recently uh	433.259	7.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	back in November surpassed what we had	437.58	6.3
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	is that last uptick in August which is a	440.759	5.461
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	good sign you'll also note if you follow	443.88	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the gray line all the way across to the	446.22	5.28
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	far Edge that we are currently right at	448.44	6.599
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that same area again we are testing that	451.5	6.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	uh that ceiling of resistance meaning	455.039	5.581
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that we're looking at having potential	458.34	4.079
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	opportunity to break that and then	460.62	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	possibly go higher if you consider where	462.419	5.581
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we are today with the Dow closing today	465.36	6.779
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	at uh to close at 33 9 10 and then you	468.0	6.66
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	compare that to the close back here at	472.139	6.361
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	36 799 or 36 8. you can tell we've got	474.66	6.18
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	about 10 up if the Dow were to continue	478.5	5.34
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	on up as it is you would also note that	480.84	4.859
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the 50-day moving average is definitely	483.84	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	in a positive trend and we have the	485.699	4.261
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	daily activity above it we can see that	487.44	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the 200-day moving average is still	489.96	5.88
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	heading down slightly but it is still at	492.06	4.979
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	this point	495.84	3.419
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	um not in the positive area we'd like	497.039	3.961
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	for it to be so we've got at this point	499.259	4.021
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	two out of the three indicators looking	501.0	3.18
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	better	503.28	3.0
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we'll drop down here to moving average	504.18	3.959
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	convergence Divergence on the short	506.28	3.78
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	terms we can see that this time around	508.139	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	when the market broke it barely broke	510.06	5.159
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	down through the uh	512.459	4.861
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	uh nine-day average here	515.219	3.481
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and we can see it turn around headed	517.32	3.48
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	back up again so I'm very curious to see	518.7	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what that means as we roll forward here	520.8	6.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	into the next month or two months so far	523.14	6.18
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	January has been a pretty good month we	526.92	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	can't complain about it starting here	529.32	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	January 6th and then moving on up we're	531.3	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	certainly in positive territory for the	534.12	2.7
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	month	535.86	3.599
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	all of these pieces together would cause	536.82	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	me to say well from the Dow's	539.459	4.621
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	perspective it's not too bad not too bad	541.56	3.42
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	at all	544.08	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	if I want to look at another one of the	544.98	7.02
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	indexes let's take for instance the uh	548.22	7.46
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the S P 500	552.0	3.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what I see similarly but not quite the	560.7	5.46
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	same so here's the high back in January	564.12	5.82
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	but you'll notice that the uh	566.16	6.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the disparity between the high of where	569.94	5.22
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we were back in January of 2022 compared	572.76	3.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to the high where we are today with the	575.16	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	with the Russell tooth or the S P 500	576.66	5.46
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we're just barely breaking that 200-day	579.48	5.039
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	moving average and the 50-day moving	582.12	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	average the blue is down here it is	584.519	3.661
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	moving back up again we're seeing some	586.26	5.579
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	some interesting upward Trend but you'll	588.18	6.779
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	note each High has still been lower than	591.839	5.821
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the previous so far we will note though	594.959	4.141
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that the lows are starting to pick back	597.66	3.179
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	up again so we're starting to move into	599.1	3.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	this place where as they come together	600.839	4.081
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that convergence Divergence will force	602.54	5.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it either up or down now compared to the	604.92	5.4
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Dow which is the 30 multinational	607.92	3.72
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	companies that represent various	610.32	5.04
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Industries the s p is representing uh	611.64	5.639
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	500 different companies in the these 11	615.36	5.22
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Industries and so being a broader index	617.279	5.581
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we can see that it's not reacting quite	620.58	7.52
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	as uh exuberantly as the as the Dow was	622.86	8.099
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	which is important here in a minute we	628.1	4.48
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	can tell that it's kind of come up and	630.959	3.541
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and taken off again on the short-term	632.58	5.64
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	macd but still we're not seeing quite	634.5	5.82
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the excitement with the broader index of	638.22	5.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the S P 500 as we had seen to the Dow	640.32	5.82
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	let's go and take a look then at the	643.38	5.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Russell 2000.	646.14	3.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so the Russell we move back here we see	654.54	5.52
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it had its high back in November of 2021	657.24	6.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	in January it it was coming back down	660.06	6.0
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it's come down we can see again that if	663.36	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we look at just the tops here the	666.06	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	ceilings of resistance we can see that	668.04	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we're sort of stuck here other than this	670.38	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	one anomaly we're sort of stuck here at	672.72	3.78
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	this point where they haven't quite	675.24	3.779
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	broken Above This higher level now the	676.5	5.579
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Russell 2000 by its name two thousand	679.019	5.101
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	largest companies in America obviously	682.079	3.481
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we have a much broader group of	684.12	3.36
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	companies in there and so they're not	685.56	4.019
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	getting quite the same growth however	687.48	4.02
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	having said that you will note the	689.579	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	50-day moving average is positive and	691.5	7.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the um daily activity for the Russell is	693.899	7.801
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	still above that that margin by quite a	698.7	4.92
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	bit the 200-day moving average is still	701.7	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	negative we're also seeing though the	703.62	3.18
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	same kind of behavior down here in the	705.54	2.58
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	short macd	706.8	3.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so we see that if we go back to the high	708.12	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	of November we can tell we have quite a	710.04	4.919
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	ways to go to do that much more than a	712.5	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	10 growth to make that happen and so	714.959	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that gives us some pause for a second	717.3	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	why aren't these keeping up why isn't	719.339	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the s p and the Russell keeping up with	721.44	4.139
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the Dow we'll come to that in one more	723.839	2.881
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	second	725.579	6.021
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	lastly let's take a look at the NASDAQ	726.72	4.88
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	NASDAQ is the worst of them uh has had	734.399	6.18
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the uh the the least excitement there	737.82	6.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	certainly the high back in January	740.579	5.581
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	uh compared to the fact the daily	743.94	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	activity is still just barely breaking	746.16	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	above the 50-day moving average 50-day	748.68	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	moving average still hasn't shown quite	750.48	4.94
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that upward Trend we'd like to see yet	753.18	5.58
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so if I'm looking at this and also I did	755.42	5.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	mention or did I failed to mention that	758.76	3.36
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we're seeing a similar kind of behavior	760.74	4.02
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	but this time around we took a much	762.12	5.519
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	bigger dip below the short macd and	764.76	4.259
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we're starting to move back up again so	767.639	3.241
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what does all this mean well I don't	769.019	3.841
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	know what it means but I have opinions	770.88	5.22
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and so here's my opinion when uh when a	772.86	5.4
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	bull market or a bear Market is over you	776.1	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	find that first thing that happens is	778.26	5.28
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the Risk Takers jump in and the Very the	780.24	5.7
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	very uh conservative people jump in to	783.54	5.82
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the the the Dow the the multinationals	785.94	5.82
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the the Blue Chips those are the first	789.36	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	two behaviors we've seen that for sure	791.76	3.54
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	from when I showed you on the Dow we've	793.56	3.3
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	seen money moving back into the Dow	795.3	3.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that's what drives the market up is	796.86	3.719
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	money moving in so that makes me think	798.54	4.739
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	okay we might be moving to a place where	800.579	6.741
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	this particular uh bear Market or or or	803.279	6.481
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	uh down market we've been experiencing	807.32	5.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	maybe starting to come to an end but we	809.76	5.22
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	don't see it in the broader indexes yet	812.82	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	certainly with uh the NASDAQ which is	814.98	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	very Tech heavy we still don't see it	817.68	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	there and that has been one of the	819.6	5.58
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	leading uh growth areas out of the	821.88	5.94
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	pandemic and so maybe that's part of the	825.18	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	retrenching right now maybe that's part	827.82	4.139
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	of what's going on but it's still not	829.38	3.959
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	there yet	831.959	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so we got the 500 companies in America	833.339	6.901
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the 2000 the tech heavy NASDAQ none of	836.339	5.761
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	them showing quite that kind of support	840.24	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	or excitement yet for the economy that	842.1	6.179
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the Dow is but again remember the Dow	845.1	5.76
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	because it's Blue Chip and safe and	848.279	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	strong typically tends to be that first	850.86	3.539
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	place as you move through sector	853.079	3.601
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	rotation that people jump in the Risk	854.399	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Takers will jump into the smaller	856.68	3.959
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	companies and there's some information	858.959	3.481
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that shows that could be happening too	860.639	4.561
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	but it doesn't mean it's over yet it	862.44	4.199
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	just means that we might be moving in	865.2	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the right direction so those who are who	866.639	4.561
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	aren't faint of heart this might be the	869.04	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	time to get back in again this might be	871.2	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the time to go ahead and take advantage	873.12	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	of that understanding that you might see	875.16	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	some volatility we might see some up and	877.38	2.94
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	down that we aren't looking forward to	879.0	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	or not expecting and that that might uh	880.32	6.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	kind of be scary for moments but uh	883.5	5.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	depending upon what comes out of these	887.22	3.419
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	next two quarters I was just talking	888.66	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	with a number of clients today who were	890.639	3.721
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	saying oh my goodness you know I hear	893.04	3.0
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that 2023 is going to be bad I hear	894.36	3.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	there's recession I hear there's this I	896.04	2.58
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	hear there's that	897.48	3.719
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it's possible and certainly there are	898.62	3.959
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	some indications those things are true	901.199	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	but there's also other indications that	902.579	5.101
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it might not be quite as bad yet so that	905.459	3.841
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	maybe once we get through the first and	907.68	4.019
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	second quarters and move into the latter	909.3	4.02
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	part of the year we might see some more	911.699	2.7
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	opportunity	913.32	2.28
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	again	914.399	4.141
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	time and more information will give us	915.6	5.22
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that uh that understanding	918.54	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	having said that let's take a look at	920.82	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	inflation because inflation is one of	922.5	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	those things where it has certainly been	924.42	5.34
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	heavy on the hearts of many people uh	927.0	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	you're looking here at the inflation	929.76	5.04
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	obviously back in June of last year we	931.26	5.819
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	hit a high but you'll notice we have	934.8	4.979
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	been turning down each month so now	937.079	6.481
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we're at in December of last of 22 we	939.779	6.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	experienced 6.5 percent inflation year	943.56	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	over year	946.019	5.281
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that's not terrible it's much higher	948.06	5.399
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	than what we've seen before and it does	951.3	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	take us back to if we go over here for	953.459	4.261
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	instance 6.2 six point somewhere there	955.44	3.78
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	takes us back to October November of	957.72	4.679
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	2021 be nice to get back down here to	959.22	5.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	these lower inflations that we were so	962.399	3.601
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	used to	964.38	4.079
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	um certainly uh after all this inflation	966.0	5.42
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	is said and done we're going to be uh	968.459	5.401
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	challenged by the fact that costs are	971.42	4.419
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	much higher matter of fact in this	973.86	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	report further down here it identifies	975.839	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	where did I read that at	978.18	6.019
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we don't want to misquote what it said	980.459	7.201
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	oh there we are uh U.S super price index	984.199	8.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	or CPI was about 258 dollars uh 258.84	987.66	8.299
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	in 2020 is forecasted to be as high as	992.519	7.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	325.6 in 2027. uh comparing that the	995.959	5.981
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	monetary fund the value of a dollar on	999.959	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the international monetary fund so we	1001.94	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	can see over the next uh	1004.699	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	well since we're in 2023 the startup we	1006.74	4.019
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	can see over the next four years that	1009.139	3.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it's going to grow we're going to have	1010.759	3.841
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	some more cost of living but we also	1012.259	5.88
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	will see jobs which are uh very low on	1014.6	5.94
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	unemployment we'll see corporations that	1018.139	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	are making decent profit we'll see all	1020.54	3.239
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	those pieces come together and so	1022.519	2.581
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	hopefully we'll see this inflation	1023.779	4.501
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	continue to tick down uh having said	1025.1	5.4
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that when we find that the printing of	1028.28	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	US Dollars continues to create sort of	1030.5	3.839
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that inflationary Trend that we're	1032.78	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	struggling with a bit hopefully we'll	1034.339	4.321
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	see government policy start to change	1036.38	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and do that better	1038.66	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	one last piece I want to hit on is GDP	1039.98	5.219
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	information we don't have the current uh	1042.62	6.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Q4 numbers yet but they're coming out we	1045.199	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	are expected to see those it was the	1048.74	4.58
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	26th we're expected to see those and the	1050.059	5.521
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	consensus would be probably around one	1053.32	4.719
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	point I'm sorry consensus 2.8 uh this	1055.58	3.959
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	particular website's Viewpoint is about	1058.039	5.401
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	1.2 positive which would mean that we	1059.539	6.921
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	will end up with a slight growth for	1063.44	5.34
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	2022 even though we had a couple of bad	1066.46	5.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	quarters or uncomfortable quarters we	1068.78	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	would end up with some growth for the	1071.72	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	year uh there is still a question about	1073.52	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	whether or not we're going to exceed	1075.86	5.58
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	more uh slow down in in GDP growth or	1077.36	7.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	maybe even negative GDP in 2023	1081.44	5.94
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	again we'll deal more with that as we	1085.22	4.98
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	come into uh next the next month's	1087.38	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	meeting because we'll have more data to	1090.2	3.479
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	work off of there I'm not going to make	1091.7	3.359
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	a prediction because honestly I don't	1093.679	2.701
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	know	1095.059	3.301
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	um there's so many moving parts and the	1096.38	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	economy seems to be so wonky right now	1098.36	5.22
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so I'm going to tell you that I see some	1100.58	6.479
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	blue sky out there I see some clouds but	1103.58	6.479
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	I do have a relatively strong opinion	1107.059	5.161
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that I think by the end of this year we	1110.059	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	could see sort of a normalization of	1112.22	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	market performance that would be a	1114.679	4.201
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	result of good or stronger economic	1116.78	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	performance but	1118.88	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we will continue to watch carefully and	1120.62	4.919
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	work through that process and decide how	1122.72	5.459
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to divide out assets to make the best	1125.539	5.76
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	outcome for that	1128.179	6.921
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	let me go back here	1131.299	3.801
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so as always	1137.48	3.02
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	versification is our friend	1142.88	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	not putting all of our eggs in one	1145.88	2.94
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	basket	1147.62	3.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	casting our bread upon the Water to	1148.82	3.719
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	seven yes to eight portions because we	1150.74	2.76
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	don't know what's going to work and	1152.539	3.841
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what's not so bottom line is is that we	1153.5	5.4
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	continue to adjust portfolios we became	1156.38	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	more conservative in September and	1158.9	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	October and quite honestly missed a	1160.46	3.48
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	little bit of that upturn but we're	1162.5	3.299
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	taking a look now that we think this is	1163.94	3.42
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	based on the information I was showing	1165.799	3.301
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	you looked like this could really be the	1167.36	3.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	start of that and so for those of you	1169.1	3.42
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	who have a higher risk tolerance we're	1170.6	3.36
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	going to begin moving some of these	1172.52	3.18
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	different models back up to more	1173.96	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	aggressive positions we will talk with	1175.7	5.04
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	you who are not quite as comfortable and	1178.16	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we'll make a discussion we'll have a	1180.74	2.939
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	discussion on that make a decision based	1182.0	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	on what your thoughts are but dividing	1183.679	4.921
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	out your assets into the various groups	1186.38	4.679
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	identifying how not just one group did	1188.6	5.22
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	but all of the groups combined it is a	1191.059	4.441
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	is a big determination here by either	1193.82	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	dollar amount or percentage to make sure	1195.5	4.799
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that your Tactical consensus for all of	1197.66	5.1
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	your Investments both with us what we	1200.299	5.281
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	call Asset Center management or AUM and	1202.76	5.1
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	assets outside of us which we'd call aha	1205.58	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	assets held away we're looking to see	1207.86	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that your total portfolio shows a	1210.32	5.7
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	continuous movement forward and very you	1212.6	5.22
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	know work very hard to minimize risk on	1216.02	3.18
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that at the same time	1217.82	3.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	no guarantees	1219.2	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it's not possible in this world but we	1220.94	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	do the very best we can through	1223.58	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	diversification and balancing out and	1225.02	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	trying to match your needs for cash	1227.72	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Reserve or income or probability or	1229.34	5.82
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Surety tax minimization understanding	1232.4	5.279
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	your risk tolerance diversifying as this	1235.16	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	chart shows and then using some of the	1237.679	3.901
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	tools of dollar cost averaging asset	1239.6	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	cyclical management waiting and waiting	1241.58	3.839
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and maintaining entry and exit	1244.1	3.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	strategies to help balance everything	1245.419	4.441
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	out and create the the best process	1247.22	5.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	going through difficult times and then	1249.86	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	coming out of those difficult times so	1252.38	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we're going to continue to be proactive	1253.94	5.04
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	wherever possible and reactive whenever	1256.7	5.58
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	necessary and as always your Insight	1258.98	6.0
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	your opinions your concerns and the	1262.28	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	goals you see will be critical to our	1264.98	3.78
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	thinking to my thinking when I'm talking	1266.9	3.72
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	with you	1268.76	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so now that's about all I'm going to hit	1270.62	6.059
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	on for the uh market update economic	1272.96	5.099
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	update because I think we're waiting for	1276.679	3.36
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	some more information and I think as we	1278.059	3.48
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	come out of Q4 it's probably going to	1280.039	3.121
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	have a much better discussion next month	1281.539	2.76
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	for that	1283.16	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	having said that though this last year	1284.299	6.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	has been a a big discussion in my	1287.12	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	industry which is kind of inside	1290.539	3.901
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	baseball for you about fiduciary	1291.74	4.319
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	responsibilities	1294.44	5.28
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it started in 2016 and it became this uh	1296.059	6.48
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	this discussion about best interest and	1299.72	5.52
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	prohibited transaction exemptions and	1302.539	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	looking at how we were handling	1305.24	4.679
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	qualified plans not we but the entire	1306.799	7.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	industry looking at how for instance uh	1309.919	8.461
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	a plan administrator for a 401k has to	1314.419	6.181
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	be identified has to be as a process in	1318.38	4.679
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	place for uh to be classified as a	1320.6	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fiduciary	1323.059	4.681
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	uh I have a a registered investment	1324.2	6.479
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	advisor license as well as I work with	1327.74	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	broker dealer where we are part of their	1330.679	5.821
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	investment advisory uh team and not that	1332.6	5.4
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we're part of their team but we work	1336.5	3.539
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	with their resources we use third-party	1338.0	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	managers and we have some input in all	1340.039	4.801
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	of the processes that we do here and I	1342.86	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	enjoy that and that's because I've	1344.84	3.719
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	always thought of myself ever since I	1346.82	3.479
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	started over three and a half decade	1348.559	5.641
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	decades ago as a fiduciary whether I was	1350.299	6.301
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	identified as one listed as one or just	1354.2	5.099
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	wasn't but I have always considered I	1356.6	6.059
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	want to be that fiduciary when it comes	1359.299	6.061
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to helping clients maximize their family	1362.659	4.081
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	resources	1365.36	3.54
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	but lately here in the last year or two	1366.74	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it's become much bigger question about	1368.9	4.259
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	handling all the qualified money as	1371.0	4.799
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	people retire they roll money out of	1373.159	6.241
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	401ks into IRAs what is that fiduciary	1375.799	5.221
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	responsibility to the advisor he's	1379.4	3.659
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	taking over that management and that has	1381.02	4.92
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	been a much bigger question which really	1383.059	5.341
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fit fine for me but we began to look at	1385.94	5.34
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	how we're going to manage this wisely to	1388.4	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	make sure that we really are stepping up	1391.28	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	our game because in today's world now	1393.08	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	everybody who is working with qualified	1395.36	4.679
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	plans has to be able to meet that	1397.64	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	standard and we've been doing it but now	1400.039	4.741
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	I want to say how do we go one step	1402.5	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	further than everybody else how do we	1404.78	3.899
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	provide Excellence beyond the average	1406.34	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and so that's what I want to take some	1408.679	4.681
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	time to talk about today with you on how	1410.9	4.259
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we're doing that	1413.36	4.319
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what is a fiduciary I suspect probably	1415.159	5.88
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	everybody on the on the call has has	1417.679	5.161
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	experienced that term before or heard	1421.039	3.421
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	about it or maybe even has some	1422.84	2.88
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	understanding of it but I thought to	1424.46	3.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	break it down into sort of a working	1425.72	4.319
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	example there are many kinds of	1427.9	3.94
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fiduciaries directors of Corporations	1430.039	3.901
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	may be fiduciaries for the stockholders	1431.84	3.42
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	meaning they're supposed to make	1433.94	3.479
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	decisions in the best interest of their	1435.26	5.159
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	stockholders executors maybe fiduciaries	1437.419	5.581
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	for trust accounts for the decedents for	1440.419	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	those beneficiaries of that trust	1443.0	4.799
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	uh trustees maybe fiduciaries for the	1445.159	4.441
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	beneficiaries in the accounts where	1447.799	3.961
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	they're helping to deal with the	1449.6	4.319
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	administrative responsibilities lawyers	1451.76	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	maybe fiduciaries for their clients	1453.919	4.201
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	because they're supposed to say if I	1456.26	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	were sitting over in that seat how would	1458.12	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	I want to be treated fiduciaries are	1460.4	5.519
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	people who act in a position of trust	1462.98	5.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	they're expected to bring their best	1465.919	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	their a game to the discussion	1468.14	6.06
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	but that language is even more important	1470.539	4.921
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	as you start to break it out and say	1474.2	3.479
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	well who is and who is not acting like	1475.46	3.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that	1477.679	3.36
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so while every industry has different	1478.7	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	standards for it and ours does as well	1481.039	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	they typically fall to these Five Points	1482.84	5.52
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	about Karen skill loyalty no conflicts	1485.179	5.521
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	information and accountability	1488.36	5.4
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and some of the common rules governing	1490.7	4.979
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	most fiduciaries are as follows	1493.76	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fiduciaries must act with Karen skill	1495.679	4.021
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	for the people they're caring for	1498.02	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	they're serving they're working with	1499.7	4.979
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fiduciaries must act with loyalty to the	1501.98	5.04
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	beneficiary doing their very best to try	1504.679	4.441
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to figure out what's the next best move	1507.02	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	for that person especially in light if I	1509.12	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	were in their situation how would I want	1511.88	5.22
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to be worked with if I'm a risk taker	1513.74	4.98
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that's one way if I'm a risk avoider	1517.1	3.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that's a different responsibility of the	1518.72	4.459
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fiduciary has to think about	1520.34	5.579
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fiduciaries may not profit from their	1523.179	6.041
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fiduciary position at the expense of the	1525.919	5.281
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	beneficiaries other than reasonable	1529.22	4.02
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	compensation reasonable compensation	1531.2	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	being decided by the entire industry	1533.24	5.88
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what is reasonable but outside of that	1535.82	6.0
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the fiduciary shouldn't profit off of	1539.12	6.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	some inside knowledge or some difficult	1541.82	6.3
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	situation or challenging situation the	1545.72	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	person they're caring for is in so	1548.12	4.919
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	compensation is fine but anything beyond	1550.46	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	reasonable compensation is problematic	1553.039	4.201
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	from a fiduciary viewpoint	1555.08	3.78
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and fiduciaries must inform	1557.24	3.539
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	beneficiaries about their activities and	1558.86	3.66
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	are accountable if they violate these	1560.779	3.361
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fiduciary duties	1562.52	4.259
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	meaning that they have to be looking at	1564.14	4.98
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what the the people they're caring for	1566.779	5.161
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	need if something happens that that it's	1569.12	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	not working out like they thought they	1571.94	3.119
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	need to talk about it try to be do their	1573.38	4.22
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	very best to keep that person up to date	1575.059	4.98
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and and take their accountability	1577.6	4.179
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	seriously	1580.039	5.101
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	now as I said I've always as long as I	1581.779	4.681
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	remember being in this industry which I	1585.14	3.36
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	started in 1986 I've always thought of	1586.46	5.76
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	myself as operating with this standard	1588.5	6.779
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	but now as I look at the fact that many	1592.22	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	people in my industry are being called	1595.279	3.061
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to do this and that's a whole other	1596.9	2.7
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	discussion if I wanted to share with you	1598.34	2.579
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	about the difference between sales	1599.6	3.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	people and managers and fiduciaries and	1600.919	5.041
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	how that all fits together but now I'm	1603.5	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	thinking and I as I always have how do	1605.96	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we bring Excellence to this model as it	1608.0	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	is learning as it's changing and growing	1610.22	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	right now and so that's what I wanted to	1612.5	3.179
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	talk with you about what we've been	1614.6	3.3
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	doing in the last year or so and what	1615.679	4.141
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we're wanting to do is we go forward	1617.9	5.279
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so let me share with you my experience	1619.82	5.64
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	working with different clients over this	1623.179	3.48
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	length of time	1625.46	3.42
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that I kind of come to realize that	1626.659	4.741
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	clients sort of fall into four groups	1628.88	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	from an advisory Viewpoint first off	1631.4	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	there's a self-directed the	1633.62	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	do-it-yourselfers and that's great I	1635.6	5.34
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	think that's a fantastic person and we	1638.24	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	don't really do a lot of work with	1640.94	3.719
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	diy-ers because why well they're diy-ers	1642.2	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	I mean if you're a guy or a gal who	1644.659	3.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	builds stuff at your house you typically	1647.0	3.179
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	don't hire a contractor to come in and	1648.559	4.381
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	do the work unless you get beyond your	1650.179	5.641
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	your expertise so diy-ers they're	1652.94	4.979
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	they're wonderful people I I talk to	1655.82	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	them every so often but most time that's	1657.919	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	not our primary relationships and if	1660.02	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	they are it's a temporary sort of thing	1662.539	3.361
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	where we're helping them with one thing	1664.58	3.42
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	which brings you the second type event	1665.9	6.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	driven somebody gets a a large bonus or	1668.0	6.179
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	they get an inheritance or they have a	1672.02	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	big tax bill or they have some loss they	1674.179	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	have to deal with special circumstances	1676.4	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	those are people that usually when they	1678.559	4.681
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	come into the office or we meet they	1681.08	3.839
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	will say hey I got this problem can you	1683.24	3.0
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	help me with it and we take a look at	1684.919	3.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that particular or event and say you	1686.24	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	know we can and here's how we might do	1688.159	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that	1690.32	5.099
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	next would be the value-added advisory	1692.299	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	relationship and that's that person who	1695.419	4.021
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	wants some assistance they kind of want	1697.159	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to run things themselves and do things	1699.44	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	they maybe have an attorney or an	1701.419	4.201
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	accountant or a financial advisor or	1703.4	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	somebody who helps them with various	1705.62	4.799
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	pieces but they kind of want to handle	1707.24	4.74

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what I've experienced over the time is	1756.08	3.18
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to say that if I find somebody who's	1757.64	3.36

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	sort of model that it certainly involves	1778.279	4.561
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fiduciary thinking but it's the bottom	1780.86	4.38

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	in all of this there's sort of two	1806.96	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	questions I think that become incumbent	1808.64	4.86

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and that might give you some Clues to	1826.58	3.719
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	where you are on this process second	1828.5	5.159

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and that kind of then moves me on to	1843.62	3.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what we're trying to bring to the table	1845.6	4.439

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	as a quick reminder there are three	1856.88	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	phases for your financial Journey the	1859.1	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	first phase where the green line is	1861.74	2.64
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	going up the mountain that's the	1863.36	2.58
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	accumulation phase or we might call it	1864.38	2.76
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	pre-retirement	1865.94	3.239
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it's not all about retirement to be	1867.14	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	honest with you but truthfully most	1869.179	4.441
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	people do have a focus on that and so	1871.46	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	during that pre-retirement accumulation	1873.62	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	phase you might have other things you're	1876.26	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	trying to do have children raise	1877.58	4.319
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	children put children through college	1880.22	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	buy a house start a business do other	1881.899	4.681
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	things that you enjoy take care of	1884.96	3.06
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	things you don't enjoy along the way	1886.58	3.839
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that's just part of the process	1888.02	4.019
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	you get to the top of that mountain you	1890.419	3.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	plant your flag and you say you know	1892.039	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what I am ready to retire or redirect	1893.539	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and then you start back down that's	1896.899	3.841
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	where you go into the decumulation phase	1898.279	4.681
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and the first few years of that there is	1900.74	5.7
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	sequence of of uh return risk meaning	1902.96	4.439
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that	1906.44	3.359
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	if you have a really bad a couple of	1907.399	4.441
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	years in those first five years it can	1909.799	3.541
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	absolutely blow up your retirement	1911.84	3.66
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	planning process so we try to be very	1913.34	3.719
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	careful about that as you go further	1915.5	3.899
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	down the plan down the mountain you then	1917.059	4.321
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	get to the bottom where you have EOL	1919.399	5.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	risk or end of life issues those are the	1921.38	5.279
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	risks where for instance most people	1924.559	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	spend the bulk of their health care	1926.659	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	dollars in the last year of their life	1928.159	4.801
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	all over all the other years combined	1930.799	4.081
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it's typically that last year where they	1932.96	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	spend the most and so end of life issues	1934.88	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	incapacitation whether it's physical or	1937.1	5.1
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	cognitively those are all issues that we	1939.74	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	thought about in that last phase of life	1942.2	3.959
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and then once you're are done with those	1944.24	4.319
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	resources now you transfer	1946.159	4.441
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to your loved ones the people you care	1948.559	5.1
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	about the Charities you enjoy uh the	1950.6	5.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	friends whoever it is that you want to	1953.659	5.221
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to prepare resources for that's what	1955.76	4.919
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that last phase is about so the three	1958.88	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	phases accumulation decumulation and	1960.679	4.081
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	transfer	1963.44	3.42
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and I'm going to point to two things	1964.76	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	here one at the top where it says	1966.86	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Direction determines destination	1968.36	5.22
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	all of our planning resources are are	1970.7	5.82
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	designed to identify Direction	1973.58	5.339
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	it doesn't determine outcome it	1976.52	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	determines a direction that you're	1978.919	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	headed which points us to a direction or	1981.14	4.98
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	a destination that you might experience	1983.779	4.02
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and we want to make sure that people can	1986.12	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	see carefully as we try to put together	1987.799	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	various calculations that we are	1990.26	4.139
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	thinking this through carefully	1992.659	3.961

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	important	2364.599	4.861

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	are and to understand and in this case	2374.74	5.04
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	assets you might have with us and assets	2377.26	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	you might not have with us you might	2379.78	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	have various Assets in here and we're	2381.82	3.299
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	applying a score to it	2383.38	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	matching that score up to what you say	2385.119	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	your risk tolerance is and then you	2387.82	3.299
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	might have assets that aren't with us	2389.859	3.601
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and we're matching that risk score up to	2391.119	4.921
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	come to a an overall number and then	2393.46	5.1
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	individual number per asset now I want	2396.04	3.78
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to say something here very clearly	2398.56	2.82
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	you'll note there's a little note down	2399.82	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	here financial calculators are a way to	2401.38	4.739
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	analyze information and help make	2404.44	3.54
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	predictions they cannot guarantee	2406.119	4.321
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	outcomes there is no guarantee on here	2407.98	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so while it identifies what the	2410.44	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	riskalized GPA is and identifies a	2412.42	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	portfolio next six months could be	2414.82	4.92
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	really good maybe not so good there's no	2417.16	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	guarantee that that's the case because	2419.74	3.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	this is identifying here it's 95	2421.24	5.099
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	probability there's no guarantee on that	2423.64	5.64
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that it can do that but again Direction	2426.339	4.981
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	determines destination so we can see	2429.28	5.46
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what direction this portfolio is how	2431.32	6.06
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	various accounts compared to your risk	2434.74	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	scoring and how the overall portfolio	2437.38	4.199
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	compares to your total risk score	2439.48	4.619
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that's the purpose of this to help you	2441.579	5.161
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	have a tool to be able to assess where	2444.099	4.621
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	you are and then help us be able to make	2446.74	3.3
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	sure that we're doing everything in our	2448.72	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	power to help keep you on that track we	2450.04	5.34
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	can then do a stress test with it and	2452.98	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	compare it for instance what happens in	2455.38	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the 2013 bull market were to happen	2457.42	5.1
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	again or the 2008 bear Market or if the	2459.46	5.1
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	financial crisis were to happen what	2462.52	4.92
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	kind of experience would your portfolio	2464.56	5.039
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	work with that and we have other tools	2467.44	4.139
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that we use that I'll show you in a	2469.599	5.341
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	second but the bottom line is is that	2471.579	6.54
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	I think that especially from a fiduciary	2474.94	6.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Viewpoint or from a financial advisory	2478.119	5.401
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Viewpoint we manage people's	2481.18	5.1
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	expectations maybe more than we manage	2483.52	3.66
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	money	2486.28	3.059
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	trying to make sure that when things are	2487.18	3.78
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	not working quite like they'd like it	2489.339	3.361
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that we understand that and can help	2490.96	3.899
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	them make adjustments accordingly	2492.7	5.34
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so our goal is not that oh we're always	2494.859	6.121
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	going to outperform the S P 500 or we're	2498.04	5.46
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	always going to have Investments that	2500.98	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	always go up and never go down those	2503.5	5.46
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	things are are wonderful but unrealistic	2505.18	6.36
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the longer you do this business but what	2508.96	5.46
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we can do is work very hard to make sure	2511.54	5.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that what you're expecting is what we're	2514.42	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	working to to make happen and those	2516.7	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	results become obvious as we do our job	2518.5	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and you see how this is fitting together	2521.2	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that's my plan and so the risk reward	2522.88	5.88
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	evaluation is another tool we use to	2525.46	4.92
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	make sure that we understand what you	2528.76	3.839
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	want you understand what we're thinking	2530.38	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and that we have a good way to	2532.599	3.901
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	communicate that out not to say this is	2533.98	4.92
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	perfect it'll never have a problem but	2536.5	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	rather to say this is imperfect let's	2538.9	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	figure out what the best way to make	2541.06	5.12

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	bank would only work with this software	2607.06	3.539
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	if they had a written signed agreement	2608.98	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	where they had decided that they felt	2610.599	5.281
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	comfortable the security protocols were	2613.54	5.039
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	satisfactory for their customers are	2615.88	5.04

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	401k plan same thing's true with	2622.42	4.679
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	everything that we report online through	2624.099	5.76
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	this through this application to update	2627.099	4.921

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and with that in mind if they've agreed	2632.02	4.02
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that this is safe then you should have	2634.599	4.081
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	confidence about that too now one other	2636.04	4.559
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	thing about this this particular	2638.68	5.04
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	software comes in two versions that we	2640.599	5.941
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	use for clients that have a have a	2643.72	5.52
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	full-on comprehensive financial plan	2646.54	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	uh we have an advanced version there's a	2649.24	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fee attached to it but in my opinion	2651.22	3.78
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	based on some of the things that I'll	2653.5	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	show you it is very much worth that fee	2655.0	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and then for those who don't want to	2657.76	3.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	have a comprehensive plan but they like	2659.5	3.18
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	having the planning software available	2661.0	3.54
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	for them to do a few things	2662.68	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that is a a tradition a foundational	2664.54	5.039
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	model doesn't have the extra bells and	2667.0	3.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	whistles on it doesn't do some of the	2669.579	3.301
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	things that the other one does matter of	2670.9	3.48
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	fact quite a few of the things but it	2672.88	3.06
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	does enough that the average person be	2674.38	2.88
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	like hey you know what this has helped	2675.94	2.94
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	me know what I need to know and I'm good	2677.26	3.839
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	with that we're happy to provide that to	2678.88	4.979
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	all of our clients but as I'm operating	2681.099	5.341
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	in this mindset of saying a fiduciary is	2683.859	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	a person who's really working to help	2686.44	3.0
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	you maximize what you have	2687.819	4.201
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the advanced version of this particular	2689.44	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	application is what I love to work with	2692.02	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	because it can really drill down and	2694.18	5.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	answer questions that help you determine	2696.52	6.059
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	your your direction as well as the	2699.42	5.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	potential destination where you're	2702.579	3.661
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	headed with this	2704.68	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	so the first thing it starts with is a	2706.24	5.64
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	baseline wealth advisor extrapolation	2708.94	5.34
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and again I would remind you financial	2711.88	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	calculators whether they're ours or	2714.28	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	anybody else's are just a way to analyze	2716.14	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	information and help make predictions	2718.72	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	they can't guarantee outcomes now we	2720.22	5.399
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	take this and we use this to review what	2722.98	5.04
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we call your up and your npv squared	2725.619	4.441
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	your unique personalized possibility	2728.02	4.079
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	because everybody's different after all	2730.06	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	these years I've never met anybody who	2732.099	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	has exactly the same situation as	2734.44	4.139
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	somebody else	2736.599	5.461
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and your Net Present potential values in	2738.579	5.881
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	PV squared that kind of shows us that	2742.06	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	direction where it's going so we can see	2744.46	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	with the up where we are today we can	2746.74	3.599
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	also see expanding Back to the Future	2748.78	3.42
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what that looks like or at least what it	2750.339	3.721
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	could look like and it helps us think	2752.2	4.379
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	through the process of is this the right	2754.06	5.88
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	strategy or not now along with it I'm	2756.579	4.861
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	going to share with you that if you've	2759.94	3.36
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	done one of these reviews with me you've	2761.44	4.379
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	heard me say before I only really focus	2763.3	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	on the first three to five year I'm	2765.819	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	sorry five to seven years I I think this	2767.74	3.96
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	is all wonderful up here but there's no	2770.079	3.121
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	guarantee this is going to happen this	2771.7	4.08
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	way it just simply shows us that on the	2773.2	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	current track we're on with a straight	2775.78	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	line analysis it probably could look	2778.0	4.079
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	like it it's capable of looking like	2779.98	4.98
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that how about that but these first five	2782.079	4.681
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to seven years that's what we're focused	2784.96	3.78
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	on because that then determines the rest	2786.76	5.28
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	of this uh as we go forward year over	2788.74	5.04
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	year over year and keep updating this	2792.04	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and working with you on it we're going	2793.78	3.839
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to have	2796.18	3.36
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that ability to look out five to seven	2797.619	4.021
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	years in the future not that we can	2799.54	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	guarantee it but rather that we can at	2801.64	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	least make sure that the direction we're	2803.92	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	headed is the direction that makes the	2806.26	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	most sense for you in a retirement sense	2808.24	4.02
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	for those of you who've heard me talk	2810.94	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	about this before there is a red line a	2812.26	5.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	blue line and a green line the red line	2815.2	3.899
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	is where you run out of money before you	2817.42	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	run out of life the blue line is the	2819.099	3.72
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	sort of average of what most people see	2821.26	2.94
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	where it goes up for a while and then	2822.819	2.881
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	curves over and starts heading down as	2824.2	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the cost of living exceeds the ability	2825.7	5.58
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	of their assets to produce and then the	2828.64	4.14
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	green curve is what we call the runaway	2831.28	3.839
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	green curve that's for the person who	2832.78	5.039
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	their income is more than their outgo	2835.119	4.921
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and so therefore their assets just	2837.819	4.321
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	continue to increase and we talk about	2840.04	5.4
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	how to maximize rol in that program in	2842.14	5.28
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that strategy as well as in the blue	2845.44	4.98
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	line also that's why we have the up and	2847.42	4.919
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the npv square to help you think through	2850.42	3.12
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	the process	2852.339	5.041
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	now two examples of that uh using our	2853.54	6.539
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	test case here hairy arm we've	2857.38	4.5
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	identified what if Harry had a long-term	2860.079	4.621
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	care need at age 70 and we can see from	2861.88	4.439
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	here this is what it looked like before	2864.7	3.84
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	but with the without having long-term	2866.319	4.381
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	care coverage we can see what happens to	2868.54	4.92
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Harry's finances over over that period	2870.7	4.919
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	of time and then what happens if he	2873.46	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	passes away to his wife Mary what	2875.619	4.681
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	happens in our situation it helps us	2878.26	4.98
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	identify a stress-tested model to say	2880.3	5.46
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	hey the first one looked really really	2883.24	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	good but the second one with some	2885.76	3.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	challenges added to it might be	2887.98	3.3
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	problematic so we can then decide what	2889.66	3.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	should we do with that I decide to do	2891.28	4.079
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	nothing client might be like I'm not	2893.56	3.059
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	going to worry about it I have kids	2895.359	3.541
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	they'll step in in this example with	2896.619	3.541
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	long-term care	2898.9	2.699
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	or they might say you know what let's	2900.16	3.06
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	take a look at resources that could fix	2901.599	4.02
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that that's part of that fiduciary	2903.22	4.619
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	thinking in my mind this helping people	2905.619	4.801
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	assess where they are move forward	2907.839	6.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	wisely with their situation in mind not	2910.42	5.76
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	mine I'm not here to say Harry you have	2914.079	3.54
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to buy long-term care	2916.18	3.72
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	he might it may not make sense in his in	2917.619	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	his situation but with this information	2919.9	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Harry and Mary can then make a much	2922.359	3.541
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	better decision	2924.46	4.139
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	or we could also look at it this way an	2925.9	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	opportunity stress testing a wealth	2928.599	3.961
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	advisor opportunity in this case a	2930.7	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	business succession strategy where the	2932.56	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	person sells their business and they're	2934.96	2.879
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	trying to figure out if I sell my	2936.76	2.16
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	business what's that going to look like	2937.839	2.401
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what am I going to deal with how would	2938.92	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that work in the future so the green	2940.24	5.04
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	line shows us what happened and this	2942.52	4.62
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	supersedes what the blue line was before	2945.28	3.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and now we see all the upside growth	2947.14	5.459
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	again no guarantees	2948.96	7.54
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	but a way to identify potentially what	2952.599	5.701
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	could happen so we can make smart	2956.5	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	decisions or wise decisions with that so	2958.3	5.4
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	with that in mind we use this software	2961.18	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to help people think through decisions	2963.7	5.34
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that may be you know significantly	2965.98	5.4
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	impactful in their financial life for	2969.04	4.74
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	both today and their immediate family	2971.38	4.979
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	needs and long-term strategies and this	2973.78	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	is one of the tools we use to help do	2976.359	4.021
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that your financial dashboard gives us	2977.98	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	all kinds of data so we're not guessing	2980.38	3.66
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we're actually making good decisions	2982.54	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	based on your situation to make that	2984.04	4.34
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	happen	2986.14	2.24
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we also can take a look at a wealth	2988.48	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	transfer remember there's the	2991.54	3.6
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	accumulation phase the deacumulation	2992.8	4.68
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	phase and then the wealth transfer phase	2995.14	4.86
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and so looking at Harry and Mary's	2997.48	5.16

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that's what we're looking off of here	3002.64	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	today uh there States this if Harry were	3003.72	5.34
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to pass away first we can see what taxes	3007.02	4.26
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and fees would be What expenses would	3009.06	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	happen and then what would come to	3011.28	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	Mary's estate and when Mary passes away	3013.38	3.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we can see what the taxes and expenses	3015.66	3.9
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	are as you can sit down here as well and	3017.28	4.92
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	what goes to the heirs now then we can	3019.56	4.44
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	take the same information	3022.2	4.619
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and we can bump it forward a few years	3024.0	5.7
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	into the future and see what happens and	3026.819	4.561
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	we can see the change in numbers we can	3029.7	3.659

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and quite honestly and while I've done	3034.98	4.2
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	this in uh previous meetings I think uh	3037.079	3.661
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	September and October I reviewed this	3039.18	4.32
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	with you we can take a look at well my	3040.74	5.579
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	goodness 2.3 million 2.4 million in	3043.5	4.38
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	taxes is there anything we can do to	3046.319	3.361
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	reduce that and the answer is we can	3047.88	3.719
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that's what the purpose of this is is	3049.68	4.56
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	not just to create a will or a trust a	3051.599	4.201
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	power of attorney all these things but	3054.24	3.119
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	to actually start saying well okay so	3055.8	3.779
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	this is what I have how would I take	3057.359	4.381

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	and in the future to minimize that outgo	3061.74	5.64
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	because given the choice of given 2.4	3064.92	4.8
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	million dollars or I guess 2.9 Million	3067.38	5.52

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	that and the answer is sure there is uh	3079.14	5.459
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	not all not all ideas are are created	3082.14	4.14

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	others might not that's why we want to	3086.28	3.059
a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	take time to look at them and then	3088.14	3.12

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	hopefully the financial dashboards I I	3680.16	4.199

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	anything we're here for you but until	3805.859	5.541

a-uexWx2P74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-uexWx2P74	[Music]	3814.4	12.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Good evening.	9.24	1.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And welcome to the February edition  of Investment Advisory Review.	11.52	4.62
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	To bring you up to speed with what we see  going on, in the economy, in the markets.	16.14	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Taking a look at your financial journey, and  looking how to create, grow, protect, and preserve	21.84	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	wealth, your family's wealth, in today's economy.  I am looking forward to today's discussion. I will	26.94	7.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	be honest and say, I'm a little nervous because  I'm doing something a little different today.	34.86	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Something that I haven't done in a while with  you and to catch up on a few things that sort of,	38.88	6.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	feel challenging in the environment. So, we're going to jump into this, and I'll	46.2	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	see what I can do to share, and, and if I can shed  some light on some of the thoughts here, you're	50.76	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	aware of, and some of the things that maybe you're  thinking, but just haven't put it together yet.	55.74	3.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, hopefully tonight you'll find some  value in what we're going to talk about.	59.22	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	As always, I would remind you that there  is no one size fits all answer to anything.	63.84	6.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	You want to make sure that whatever  items you look at when it comes to	71.58	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	investing or planning, tax strategies,  legal strategies, whatever those are,	75.78	7.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	you want to make sure that they match what  your short-, mid-, and long-term goals are.	83.58	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And so, these disclosures are here just to  remind you that there is no one size that	88.26	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	fits every situation, and every family, and  every individual is unique, and therefore,	93.6	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	the strategies they use for their family wealth  management should also be unique for their needs.	98.58	6.42
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We will take a time for questions at the end,  so if you have questions, please feel free	106.2	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to raise your hand or chat those questions,  and I probably will answer them at the end.	111.0	6.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	However, if I start seeing a lot of questions  on a particular item I'm going to cover tonight,	117.54	4.38
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	then I will stop and take time  there, if that seems appropriate.	121.92	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, tonight, we're going to take a moment  to look at the market and economic review	127.5	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and update you from last month. I'm going to discuss with you	131.82	3.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	a concept: what is real wealth? I also want to show you some new	135.18	6.12
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	items on our website that I think would be very  helpful, beneficial to you, and to your family	141.3	6.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	when it comes to growing and managing wealth. Then take out, we'll close out with some wealth	147.48	6.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	advisory reflections that I think  are important for this discussion.	154.2	3.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Review your questions and update you on what's  coming next as far as our next advisory review.	157.2	6.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, when I look at the, the economic  engine, you know, it's funny.	165.24	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	During COVID, I pulled this out a few years  back when we had a different Administration.	169.74	8.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Primarily with the Obama Administration,  I pulled this out because people seem to	179.16	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	have a lot of questions and thoughts and concerns  about how policies are working and what that would	182.94	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	look like. And so, I still continue to use this,  because I think it does illustrate some thoughts.	187.26	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But I think that, when we look at the  chart tonight, or the slide tonight,	193.32	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	there hopefully, will be some more confidence,	197.46	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but we'll see. When I look at GDP growth, for  the fourth quarter of last year, it was good.	200.7	6.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It was good. We're looking almost 3% in GDP growth,	207.36	3.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and that's a very good sign. Business  profitability across the board has been better.	211.02	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	There have been some places where there are  problems, primarily tech, they had quite a	215.94	5.52
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	few layoffs, which has had a domino effect  in some other of the industries around tech.	221.46	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But, overall, there have been a continued  increase in business profitability.	226.38	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	As the supply chain whack a mole  has continued to improve through	231.96	6.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	the ingenuity of American entrepreneurs  as well as entrepreneurs around the world.	238.44	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We see that more companies are doing better than  before, but we also see some areas out there.	242.22	5.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, I gave it a plus, minus. Unemployment rates,  I will say unemployment rates are clearly a	247.68	7.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	plus. They are at record lows right now. I'm not sure that doesn't somehow feed into	254.7	5.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	another problem, which is underemployment. Employers struggling to get workers to	259.92	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	come in and stay with them. But if I'm looking at just	265.02	3.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	un- unemployment rates, they're clearly  a plus because they're so low right now.	268.2	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And interest rates are a plus minus at this  point, meaning that we have rising interest	272.52	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	rates. They haven't gotten to the point  where they're terribly problematic yet.	278.1	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Um, and from an investor's viewpoint,  somebody who’s looking for income.	283.32	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It's kind of nice to have some of those  higher rates in your savings accounts,	287.88	3.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	or your CDs, or maybe even in some of the  bonds or other programs you might use. But	291.54	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	if you're a business owner, or you're trying  to buy a house, those higher interest rates	296.64	4.62
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	have been a little more problematic. So, we've  got a plus, minus on interest rates right now.	301.26	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, two of these engines in the US. economy are  pluses, they're firing, they’re seemingly doing a	306.9	6.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	well, a good job. And then two of them are they're  running and they're, they're not flaming out,	313.62	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they’re strong, but they're just not as strong as  we'd like for them to be. So overall, I would say	318.96	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that's not a bad economic review, simplistic as it  is, it does at least give some insight into where	323.88	5.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we think things are at the current time, anyway. So, we're going to take a look at the markets,	329.7	6.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	here, and take a look at some of what the  thermometer of the markets or maybe a thermostat,	336.6	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	in some cases, what the market is, but I thought  I'm going to spend some time, and this is kinda	340.86	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	why I'm doing it a little differently tonight. You know I know I talked with, with many of you,	344.94	5.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and, and I talk with advisors across the  country, and certainly our investment firm	350.58	5.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	partners who bring different solutions to us. And it seems like at some level, there's sort of	356.4	5.94
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	this unspoken concern, that there is a disconnect  between Wall Street, Main Street, and your street.	362.34	8.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And I think that's part of what  the challenge we're facing is.	370.44	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, I thought I was gonna spend a little  bit of time tonight trying to break down	374.34	3.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	some of what that is, and what might be causing  it, and then what we might do to offset that.	377.94	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So let me stop for a second  here and go to our software.	383.34	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, this is the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  As you can tell, I've gone back a year in time.	391.32	7.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And as, for those of you who've seen me do this  before, me turn on the elements, so you can	398.82	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	see the comparatives. As those of you who've seen  me do this, before, you realize that the jagged	405.06	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	line is the daily activity of what's going on in  the day. The red line is a 200 day moving average,	410.4	6.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	which means it's an average looking at the  last 199 days with today, added to that.	416.58	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	To create more of a smooth viewpoint, so you can  kind of see what direction things are headed in.	421.92	6.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And then the blue line is a 50-day moving  average, where it's a little faster line.	428.28	6.12
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It's not quite as jagged as the daily activity,  but it still gives us a little quicker reaction	434.4	5.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to what might be happening at any point in time. As compared to, say, the 200 day moving average.	440.22	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I think it goes without saying  that the green represents up days,	445.62	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and the red represents down days. So, when I'm looking here at the at the Dow,	448.86	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	you know, since October of last year, the  Dow really started doing pretty well. I mean,	454.14	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it looked like things were gonna go south,  but they didn't turn out to be that way.	459.3	3.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And if I go back here and put the line  across, what you see is that we're now	462.9	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	back where we were in August of last year. We're not quite as good as what we would	467.34	4.38
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	have been in January of, of 2022, but we've  hit that place where we're doing better.	471.72	5.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But it seems like it could  be stalling a bit right now.	477.48	3.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And I think that has a lot to do with some  of the other concerns I'm gonna talk about	481.2	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	in a moment regarding Wall Street, Main  Street and your street, because the,	484.44	4.38
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	the economy and certainly the market's  reaction to the economy, is pretty healthy.	488.82	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We're probably only between 5 and 10% away  from the top of what we were in January.	494.16	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But somehow that doesn't feel right, because other  things feel like they're sort of, off somehow.	499.44	5.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	If I'm looking here at the activity, you can see  most recently, that today, it's gone down again,	506.46	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and we're down here sort of testing these  previous lows. I've put it right in here.	511.38	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We are sort of bouncing across this  bottom here. This floor of support,	516.66	6.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we appear to be approaching it. And that's, that's a sign	524.1	3.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that could be a challenge. But I don't know that it's going to be,	527.58	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to be honest with you. I don't think  we're going to have a big problem.	531.42	3.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I think the markets are probably  going to continue to do well,	535.02	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	even if some of the other issues that maybe  Main Street, or you, and I, on our Street,	538.26	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	find challenging. But I think the markets and the, the investment	544.98	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	firms and large, multinational companies, they  are looking at opportunity. They see a lot to	549.9	7.38
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	work with. And so, they're growing as a result  of that. So, I’m gonna tie this together here in	557.28	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	a second. So, this is the 30 largest companies  in America, broken out by several industries.	561.54	5.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We want to see something a little different. We can look at the S&P 500	566.76	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and see how it has done during the same timeframe. We can see that, so, again, going back to,	572.46	7.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	say August, it hasn't hit that high yet. We do see that the red line is a continued	579.78	5.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	downturn, but we would also note that the  highs and the last since, since December,	585.42	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	have continued to get higher until this  most recent time. And the lows are still	590.28	3.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	moving up. But it will be dependent upon what  things look like here in the next few days.	594.0	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I would say that I would not  be surprised if it breaks down	600.12	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	through the 50 day and then through the 200. But I think that, honestly, may be the signal	603.36	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	for a chance to get back in now, and really  start investing more like you have in the past.	608.22	5.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But we're going to talk about that as well. Let's take a look at one more.	613.98	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	The Russell 2000. We look at the Russell 2000,	621.96	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we can see that again, we go back to August. It  did hit that high, but it didn't hold it and it's	626.76	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	continued to go back down. It's now bouncing off  of what was a previous high, it's now breaking	632.04	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	through that. And we'll see how that looks over  the next few days. Again, wouldn't, I personally,	636.18	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	wouldn't be surprised if it runs down here breaks  through the 50-day moving average and then,	640.74	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	depending on what kind of news happens, we  what we see around the world and in the US,	645.84	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it could turn around and take off again. Now, having said that, certainly things like,	651.18	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	as a war, World War III have, I'm not suggesting  that's what's going to happen or what that would	655.74	5.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	even be, could just be a Cold War. But if that  were to happen, that certainly could be a problem.	661.56	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	If China were to do something with Taiwan, that  can be a problem, but outside of those factors,	665.76	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	there really seems to be some movement forward, a  lot of capital on hand, still low interest rates.	671.34	6.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Still, inflation is problematic,  but is steadily moving down.	678.78	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Gas prices are higher than they were before  the current administration stepped in,	683.76	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but they've come down from their highs. And so, these are all pieces that the economy	688.56	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	is looking at, and Wall Street in general is  looking at and saying, I think this is something	692.46	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we can work with, so, this kind of speaks to  what's happening in the markets. I, I know that	697.44	5.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I had expressed concerns back here in October  that we were going to see some real problems.	703.08	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Obviously, that is continued to show itself as  being a, having a desire to work itself out.	706.98	6.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I try not to get in when I think  things are problematic like this,	713.16	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but I do think that we're kind of come to  that place now, where we see enough highs	717.36	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and the lows are getting higher. That it makes  me think that we're ready for another run here.	721.44	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Maybe we're looking at single, high single  digit returns, a share, maybe low double digit.	726.72	5.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Again, it's all over the board,  because nobody really knows.	732.36	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	There's obviously concerns of a  recession continuing. Last year,	735.66	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	despite having two quarters that were negative, we  still end up not in a recessionary year. And so,	740.34	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	this year may be that year we have  a recession, but it could be a very,	745.68	2.94
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	very short-term, and a very  shallow recession, as well,	749.22	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	so those would be things we'd be watching here. But all the pieces on Wall Street do make me	753.9	6.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	think that we're moving back into that  opportunity, to make some money again,	759.96	3.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	as we look at the markets from this economy. Now, that may seem odd. I know that, again,	763.14	6.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	talking to many of you, you have concerns,  we're dealing with something else,	769.5	3.12
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and that's kind of what I wanted to spend  some energy on tonight, talking about.	772.62	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, with that in mind, let's go to that  part that I was wanting to share with you.	781.92	5.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Why the disconnect is concerning, and I don't  know that the concern is paramount for today.	787.68	10.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But I think there's this sort of uncomfortable  feeling, that somewhere down the road,	799.2	4.38
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	this disconnect can become more  problematic, and I think that's part of,	803.58	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	part of the concern that many people have. So now, I'm gonna use this chart and start off,	808.62	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	off the, the, the right side of the  chart, we're going to go backwards,	813.42	3.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I’m going to start on your street, our street. Each of us has thoughts about what's going on in	816.42	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	the economy and such, and there's the, obviously  the concern of the rising cost of living,	821.76	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and how much harder it is to make things work  now, than it was say a couple of years ago.	826.26	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Job layoffs, although not many people I've  spoken to, have had problems with job layoffs,	831.06	5.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but I think a lot of people are concerned that  somehow, that could be a problem down the road for	836.52	3.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	others. Rising interest rates, if the Fed is able  to control rising interest rates, and not make it	840.0	6.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	problematic, keep it from becoming a problem.  I think that'll be fine. But I do think that	846.54	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	is something that many are concerned about. Even  as I've talked with some of you who are trying to	850.86	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	get houses and do mortgages, you're finding it's  harder to do that. We find some banks are, are	855.0	5.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	not lending much money now, and they're actually  doing things to inhibit loaning money for houses.	860.22	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, there's some issues there going on in  the economy that I think are interesting.	865.2	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Increasing taxes. We are seeing discussions about taxes increasing.	871.02	5.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I think it's going to be harder to get that  done in the last two years of the Biden's,	876.48	4.62
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Biden’s presidency. But I do think that it  is a concern. And there certainly is other	881.1	6.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	taxes that are being levied upon people  rather than just federal income taxes.	887.4	3.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And then government intervention, which I think  is, is probably the one thing that I find most	891.96	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	interesting about this conversation, is that  depending upon where you stand politically,	897.24	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	government intervention is one  of those things where either A,	902.58	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	people think it's not enough, there should be  more government intervention to fix things.	905.82	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And then other people, depending on where they  sit on the political spectrum, they think that we,	910.14	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we need to have less government intervention. So, you just think there's too much or too	915.18	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	little depending on your political  views, and I think that's part of	919.32	3.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	this big discussion going on in the country and  across the board as it relates to the economy.	922.86	6.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Now, when you go to Main Street, Main  Street has a little different viewpoint,	928.92	3.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but not too dissimilar. Main Street is concerned	932.64	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	about rising cost of business. Certainly, many businesses have	936.54	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	either sold or gone out of business,  new businesses have replaced them,	940.74	3.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and the rising cost of business has certainly  been one of the big issues connected to that.	943.92	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Every, every month, I hear of one, of  a business that's been here for a long	948.84	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	time that has shut their doors. And it's because of the rising	952.98	3.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	cost of business. That's what they've  expressed in almost every single case.	956.34	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Increasing wages. I just got a call today from a friend	960.3	3.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	of mine, who's like, so what, I gotta hire some  employees. What is the going rate for this job?	963.84	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And so, we did some research, and  answered, and increasing wages.	968.16	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	He made a comment that he can't imagine that this  is what he paid his best employees before and now	973.02	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	just to get people in the door, he's having  to raise his wages to meet this new wage	977.7	6.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	thinking that people have today. Underemployment. It's amazing how, when you go into restaurants,	983.94	5.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they're like, we don't, you have to, we can't let  you have a reservation, because we're going to be	989.7	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	full, but you go in there, it's not full. And, because, they don't have enough	995.04	2.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	employees, and it's not just there. It's a lot of places where I find that it's hard	997.26	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	for people to find for business owners, to find  good quality candidates, to do the jobs they want.	1002.0	6.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Either because they don't want to work or because, meaning that people don't want to do that job,	1008.54	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	or because the wages are being paid by bigger  companies who have a bigger bank to pull from,	1013.28	6.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to pay those wages. Rising interest rates,	1019.88	3.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	small businesses are really struggling with that. It's been a problem for them when it comes to how	1024.2	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they're handling floor plans and, and rents  and, and buying businesses or buying property,	1028.52	6.42
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	those are all issues that they're working with.  Increasing taxes and fees across the board,	1034.94	5.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	whereas, whereas a rising cost of  living for all of us is problematic.	1041.3	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	The fees and the expenses they get  stuck on small business now are just	1046.22	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	more than they’ve ever seen before. And  then, finally, government intervention.	1051.92	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I think most businesses tend to think there's  too much government intervention, most mainstream	1055.22	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	businesses would like to see much less. And that would help them have more money,	1059.9	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to pay employees, and to meet the needs of  their customers, and to grow their business.	1063.98	6.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, your street, Main Street, and  now, let's look at Wall Street.	1071.12	2.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And this, I think, is where we see the disconnect,  because Wall Street sees us differently.	1074.0	5.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	They see this differently than you, and I do. They see this differently than Main Street	1079.88	3.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	sees it, because what they're really  looking at is capital investment.	1083.24	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	They're interested in how Main Street  is doing, but only to the point of how	1087.02	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it impacts capital investment. They don't particularly care	1090.98	3.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	because they're not involved in the  day-to-day operations of a business.	1094.58	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	They're just wanting to get the growth  off of that or the income off of that.	1098.36	6.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Return on assets and return on equity,  which we'll talk more about in a minute.	1105.02	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But when they're looking at how they value  a business and how they value a stock,	1108.98	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	if they're going to invest in a stock,  or how they value, what they might do if	1113.9	3.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they're going to lend money or do a bond issue. Return on assets and equity are two issues that	1117.44	6.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they're looking at because, again, it's not day  to day manufacturing or whatever or distribution,	1124.1	5.52
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it is the Return on Assets and  Equity that drive their thinking.	1129.62	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Quarterly earnings reports, they watch those  like a hawk, and, quite honestly, quarterly	1134.84	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	earnings reports, used to be simply an update of  what's going on. Now, they're a big production.	1138.8	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Making sure that your quarterly earnings report  reads well, so that your stock price won't drop.	1144.5	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Which is then a big impact on Wall Street and  Investment Bankers and brokers and advisors,	1149.84	5.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	because they're watching a reaction to something  that may or may not be totally accurate.	1155.54	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I'm not saying that the Quarterly Earnings  reports are wrong, but there is definitely the	1160.58	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	ability to manipulate dollars and move them  from one place to another during a quarter,	1164.9	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	or toward the end of a quarter, to  make the report look better than it is.	1169.76	2.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And we've certainly seen that  happen before in other companies.	1172.58	2.94
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Fed watching, what the Fed has to say, because  it's a governmental institution, and the watching	1176.18	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	for that seems to be a huge issue that the Wall  Street, and the investment firms are keeping	1181.52	7.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	their eye on. ESG, environmental, social, and  governance, governance policies, big issues now.	1188.72	7.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	In a lot of companies, I just had a client  reached out to me the other day and said,	1196.46	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	hey, do you think this is going  to be a problem based on some new	1199.76	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	rules that came out of the Biden Administration? What I said was that currently 90% of the Fortune	1203.06	5.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	500 are already working under ESG thinking. We don't, you know.	1208.82	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	If you understand what the ESG debate is. Essentially, yeah, I really don't have to	1214.16	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	go too far into that discussion. But if you don't, if you're new	1219.14	2.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to the party, it is certainly making  sure that all this social scoring,	1222.02	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and how we're handling environmental issues and  using governance to control certain matters, these	1226.88	6.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	are all items that that Wall Street is watching  carefully, because they're very important to them.	1233.42	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Maybe not so much to Main Street or your  street. But to Wall Street, it's a big deal.	1239.36	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And then, finally, government intervention. I think it's reasonable to say that, that,	1244.46	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	especially for multinational companies, for  S&P 500 companies, for the Dow companies,	1249.02	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	even for the Russell 2000, many of them would  like to have more government intervention.	1253.58	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And you might say, why would they want  that? And this may be that place where	1258.14	3.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	you start to see a difference in the two groups. Is that the government intervention, if you're,	1261.32	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	if you're Bank of America, or you're  Amazon, government intervention means	1265.82	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that you have the capacity to go to work  through that, that government regulation,	1270.98	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and keep and stay in business and keep going. But a small business can't compete.	1275.72	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And so, using government regulations to help  control the business environment is something that	1280.46	6.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	a lot of large companies really like. That's  why they put so much money in to lobbying.	1286.94	5.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It doesn't matter that it's  going to hurt Main Street. It	1292.16	2.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	just matters that it's going to work for them. Now, if you think that what I'm saying is, oh,	1294.92	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they're evil, they’re bad, and so on, I'm not  saying that. What I'm saying is that we need	1299.66	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to be aware that's what's going on. Because it  helps us make better decisions along the way.	1303.74	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	If, if we want to vote differently, to  get politicians in who think differently	1310.16	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	about how we're going to handle  items like that in our country.	1314.72	2.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	That's obviously one level, but from an investment  viewpoint, as an advisor, I'm required to think	1317.42	6.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	through this process and try to figure out,  how do we manage this? How do we maneuver	1323.42	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	our clients’ accounts, and assets and wealth,  through this process, to get the best outcome?	1328.34	5.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Because I can't make Wall  Street change their mind.	1334.16	3.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But what I can do is take a look at what items  help make the best opportunities for our clients.	1337.16	7.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And honestly, this topic, I could spend probably  all night talking about this, because I think not	1344.48	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	just Wall Street but Main Street, your  street, how these pieces fit together.	1349.88	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But I decided what I was going to do is just  take some time tonight to hit on basically three	1353.18	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	concepts and this is the start of the first one,  which is: is the economic outlook problematic?	1358.76	6.42
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I think it's obviously, it's obvious that  it's a challenge and we're struggling with	1365.72	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	some of the challenges of the economic  outlook, Main Street. Some businesses	1369.5	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	are doing phenomenally well right now. Commercial construction is doing well.	1373.76	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Multi-family is doing well in some sectors,  but not, but doing terrible in other sectors,	1378.68	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	small business, where it's distribution or  small-time stores or, uh, stores that specialize	1384.56	6.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	in boutique kind of products and services. Those companies are having a more difficult	1391.4	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	time right now. Restaurants are having a  difficult time, but the big chains are doing	1396.32	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	much better because they have a different  process. They have a whole process when it	1400.52	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	comes to working through regulatory items. They  have legal departments. They have all kinds of	1405.8	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	resources to keep everything going, so I could  sit and rail about how that is fair or unfair.	1410.06	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But the reality is, is that my job is to try to  figure out the best way, your job, is to try to	1414.86	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	figure out the best way to maneuver this so that  we can grow wealth to meet your long-term need,	1420.2	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	your short-, mid-, and long-term need. So, is  the economic outlook problematic, I think it is.	1425.36	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Is it, is it impossible to  maneuver? I don't think so.	1429.86	3.12
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But I do think that we have to be wise  and sort of thoughtful in our processes	1432.98	5.94
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	how we're going to go forward with this. So, now, if we take that turn to the next	1438.92	3.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	level, I wanted to get a thought out  here, which is, what is real wealth?	1442.58	5.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And it's a more complex  question than you might think.	1448.34	2.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I, I listen to lots of different resources to  try to stay connected with what makes sense,	1450.98	7.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and then to identify what might not make sense. And lately, in the last year or so, I've been	1458.12	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	hearing different things that I thought were  sort of fascinating about how, how real wealth	1463.16	5.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	should actually be looked at. Whether, again,  it's Wall Street, Main Street, or your street.	1468.8	5.52
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, if I'm going to do that,  it's, it's a complex question.	1474.32	3.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Maybe more than what you might think, and so I'm  going to try to, I'm going to try to wade down	1477.98	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	a little bit into it to identify what that is.  Now, you've seen this chart before I identify the	1483.08	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	eight different asset groups that we invest in and  try to help our clients be diversified, and meet	1488.24	5.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	their growth needs and have flexibility, and, and  have income opportunities when they need those?	1494.0	5.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And that's, That's, this is what  we do from an investment viewpoint.	1499.88	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But if you were to stop and think for a  moment about real wealth, and this isn't	1503.96	4.38
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	exhaustive either, but if you start to think  about, what is real wealth start to think	1508.34	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	about what types of wealth do you have? You would say, well, I've got cash and checking,	1512.48	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	maybe savings, CDs. You have vehicles. If you, you  might have some equipment, you might not think of	1516.68	5.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	yourself as having equipment, but you do, if you  have a TV and a refrigerator, if your business	1521.9	3.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	owner, you have even more equipment and machinery. You have your home. That's a	1525.44	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that's a piece of wealth. You have insurance policies,	1530.24	3.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	which is a protection process, to protect  against catastrophic loss of income or assets.	1533.3	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And some of those insurance products might even  have cash value in them, like life insurance,	1538.88	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	bonds, which is an asset that loans money out  to people, and pays back interests to the,	1543.5	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to the loners, uh, from, for  the, for the use of their money.	1549.08	4.38
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Stocks which represent ownership assets  where you own a piece of a company.	1554.36	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Annuities where you have an insurance  company who gets in between, and they	1559.52	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	provide certain guarantees or stabilizers,  to offset risks that you might want to avoid.	1564.38	6.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Property outside of your home. It could be personal property,	1570.62	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it could be, it could be real estate  that you own outside of your home.	1574.64	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Could be business property. Precious metals and,  and industrial metals, which I'm going to show you	1579.62	5.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	why, I know a fair number of you own precious  metals and, and as a commodity, it's something	1584.84	5.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that you find a lot of solace in. I agree with  that. And, but it is certainly a type of wealth.	1590.66	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Your business, if you're a business owner  and whether you have a small business or you	1595.22	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	have a big-small business, that is certainly  another type of wealth. Commodities, energy,	1600.38	6.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	grains, pork bellies, things of that nature,  crypto, which really hasn't been defined	1607.4	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	very well by any governmental agency. But it is clear that it is some sort	1612.68	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	of a piece of wealth, because it has  made a lot of people very wealthy and	1616.46	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it's made even more people poor, because they  didn't, they didn't understand how it worked.	1620.66	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Again, I'm not putting any judgement  or rationale on any of these types of	1626.36	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	assets. They all have strengths and weaknesses. But they do represent a way to kind of consider,	1631.04	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	what types of wealth do you have?  And again, this isn't exhaustive,	1636.02	3.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we could break this down and down and down, and  there was so much I could have put in this chart.	1639.08	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But I just wanted to kind of expand how people  think about wealth from an advisory viewpoint.	1642.98	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So along with that, let's, and this  is going to kinda be where I drive	1649.46	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	down a little bit into some of the thinking. Thinking about money past, present, and future,	1653.66	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	if you go back into history, I just listened to a  fascinating podcast from a gentleman who his whole	1658.4	7.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	focus is on buying and selling mines, M-I-N-E-S,  mines, and holding those, value them, and then	1665.9	8.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	selling them for a profit in the future, whether  that's a short-term future, a long-term future.	1674.72	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But in that podcast, he talked a great  deal about how, the thing about metal,	1679.94	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	is it is really the sort of first real  type of currency coins that we had.	1684.74	7.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It's true that there was, there were some  societies that used wood, or other things for,	1692.24	6.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	for our currency, but coinage, those little hard  pieces of metal, they were able to manufacture	1698.84	9.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	those and process them in a way, and they were  more durable and, and they would last longer.	1707.9	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And so, those, that type of coinage was really  the first real money that we actually had of	1713.06	6.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	any value on a broad basis. So, coinage was,  obviously made with metals, industrial metals,	1719.84	6.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	there are some coins that were in bronze or  copper, others that were made in silver and gold.	1726.62	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And the reason I have it that way  is that what's very interesting is,	1731.36	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	when you look at the amount of gold that  exists on planet Earth, it's minuscule.	1735.44	6.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It's very hard to produce more of it. I was just watching a show last week about	1742.04	5.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	these different companies that were competing to  mine gold, and basically, pulling out, literally,	1747.74	8.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	tons and tons and tons of dirt to get granular,  sand-type gold in, in, in grams, in micrograms,	1755.96	11.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	so the small amounts of minuscule amounts of gold. It's so hard to get it. Silver. There's more	1767.3	6.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	silver. There's more copper, and  there's more bronze out there.	1773.54	2.94
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And so even the very value of  some of these types of coins,	1776.48	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	start to give us a clue to what wealth is, the  ability to have something that has substance,	1780.56	7.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and can be used for more than just coins. Talk about that in a second.	1787.58	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Coins, while they're great. They're heavy. And you  gotta carry them in your pockets, and it's no fun.	1792.98	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	You'd have to carry giant coins  if you're going to try to match	1797.66	3.12
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	them up to evaluations. And it's just a mess. So, we went to paper as societies went along,	1800.78	5.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they moved to paper, and we went  to originally asset backed paper,	1806.6	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and that asset backed paper could be backed by  land or metals. Something that had something	1811.16	7.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	more solvent, like there was a time when US  currency, most currency was backed by gold.	1819.14	6.12
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And then today, no society has a, has a  metals backed, a gold backed currency.	1825.92	8.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Now, currency is backed by the  taxing authority of the government.	1834.62	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	No matter what nation it is, it's  backed by its ability to tax. So,	1839.54	3.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it's a faith backed currency. We're trusting that a government	1842.6	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	would have the ability to make that paper that's  in our pocket, worth what we think it's worth.	1847.04	6.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, that's where we are today in most societies  have that you may have noticed a matter-of-fact	1854.48	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	coins are kind of going away. After COVID  you started seeing signs everywhere saying,	1859.64	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	you know, we don't have any coins if you  have some, we'll trade out coins for dollars.	1863.96	3.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Coins are different, and paper is what people use,  however, that’s not where we are today, as well.	1868.16	6.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We are kind of shifting, and we're going  to more of a digital kind of currency.	1874.7	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	An NGO, Non-Governmental Organization crypto,  meaning that some organization, whether it's	1881.0	6.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Bitcoin or Ethereum or any of the other thousands  that are out there, or FTX, if you know what that	1887.0	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	is, it's some group that said, hey, we're going to  create an artificial currency, and we're going to	1892.4	7.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	use it as a promise, backed by blue sky. It's a promise that we're going to	1899.48	5.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	only create this much in this block  chain and say, that's all there is.	1905.3	4.62
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And so that will determine the value of it,  but that promise could go away in a heartbeat,	1909.92	4.62
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they can change their mind, and, and  double the amount, and then that makes	1914.54	2.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that that currency go down, because there's  nothing backing it, other than a promise.	1917.3	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And to be honest, I think it's realistic to say,	1922.64	2.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	if we look into the future, I  hear more and more about it today.	1924.98	2.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Central Bank Digital Currency, someday  we might have a government backed crypto.	1927.56	7.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It could be a national crypto. It could be an  international crypto backed by what, I don't know,	1934.58	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	would it be backed by the taxing authority of that  government? Or, if it's, like, an international	1939.5	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	monetary fund, would it be backed by the world? Would it be backed by assets, hard assets,	1944.06	5.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	don't know but when you start to look at money,  this currency, this wealth that we hang onto,	1949.88	7.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	because money is both, it is currency, you can  use it for commerce, but it's also, wealth.	1957.02	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	When you start to look at it in this sense, you  begin to realize that money, currency, coinage,	1961.46	6.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they represent something very interesting  about, what is real and what is not real.	1968.96	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And I think that's where I wanted to start  this, to think about what is real wealth.	1974.6	4.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	What is real wealth? Well, there  are many categories of wealth.	1979.46	2.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	If you look at balance sheets for  companies, there's current assets	1982.22	3.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	versus fixed assets and then for individuals and  in companies, there's variable assets as well.	1985.82	5.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	There's personal property,  there's business property.	1991.52	2.94
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	There's brand / intellectual property, there's  traditional assets versus contemporary assets.	1994.46	7.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	There's tangible assets versus intangible  assets and I'm going to even add to it	2002.38	6.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	youthful capital versus experiential capital. Because all of these types of wealth represent	2008.74	6.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	opportunities for growth, but also represent  various amounts of risk that people have to	2015.22	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	consider when they choose to invest this way. So, if I were to break out these different types,	2020.8	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	what I would say is this, current  assets are typically thought of as	2026.98	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	assets that are short-term, available  within a 12-month period of time.	2030.88	3.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Fixed assets are typically assets that are seen  as longer than that 12-month period of time.	2035.02	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	They probably can't be converted to  liquidity, or reserves or cash, if,	2040.06	6.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	any, faster than 12 months, so current assets  are within 12 months, fixed assets are longer.	2046.24	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And I am simplifying here, because  this, again, can't be exhaustive,	2051.04	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but it starts to lay out a thought  process for you. Variable assets,	2054.82	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	which are volatile, meaning they're subject  to economic and market fluctuations.	2058.78	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Then you drop to the bottom line,  personal property assets that are	2064.18	3.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	owned by individuals and families. Business property, assets that are	2067.18	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	owned by businesses and corporations,  and brand or intellectual property are	2071.02	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	assets owned by businesses, corporations,  and are typically thought of as blue sky.	2075.46	4.62
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Now, the others, you probably get those  pretty well. Let me just stop for a second,	2080.08	3.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	on brand or intellectual property. Suppose you've got a brand. Not going	2083.8	5.52
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to name any company, 'cause I don't  wanna sound like I'm saying something	2089.32	1.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	bad about somebody or good about somebody. But you can think of brands that you've heard	2091.18	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	about before, that, maybe they were great brands  at one time, but then, something bad happened.	2095.08	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Maybe, maybe they had a bad product, or they  had a bad situation or whatever, and that	2100.78	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	brand wasn't worth anything anymore, or, that  brand was seriously damaged in the discussion.	2104.62	6.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And that's just simply blue sky.  It was good one day, and then some	2110.92	4.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	bad things happened. It wasn't good anymore. Same thing is true with intellectual property.	2114.94	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Maybe you have an idea that has a lot of power,  and could produce huge amounts of wealth,	2118.84	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but then something comes along  that makes your idea useless. So,	2124.12	3.42
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it had no real value, it's just blue sky. But make no mistake, that brand,	2127.54	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	or intellectual property, is certainly, what  has made many corporations, DOW, S&P 500,	2132.1	6.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Russell 2000, multinational corporations. That brand and intellectual thinking,	2138.76	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	is what has made those companies worth  billions and billions of dollars.	2144.1	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, it is clearly an asset model, even  though it's not something that most	2149.2	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	of us think we're back to either current  assets or fixed assets, personal property,	2153.4	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	maybe variable assets, or business property. But, make no mistake it is that difference	2157.72	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	between these huge multinational companies and  that's why they protect their brands so carefully.	2162.64	5.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	That's why they protect their intellectual  property so carefully, but it's also what makes	2168.1	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	their stock, their, the equity ownership  in their companies so valuable as well.	2172.66	5.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, if we look at tangible assets, what,  what I mean by tangible are these are	2179.92	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	things that you can actually get a hold of.  You can sort of put your arms around them.	2183.82	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	They're tangible. If modern society	2188.74	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	were to collapse, I don't think that's  what's going to happen, but if it did,	2191.98	2.94
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	these would still remain. They would likely still  be in position because you would still need them.	2194.92	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	They're connected to something real. That's  why they're traditional and tangible.	2200.26	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And they're the building blocks  of all investment or wealth.	2204.1	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, what are they? Well, land for farming. And  when we had a land economy long before we had the	2207.4	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	industrial revolution, generation after generation  would pass land on, and that was the wealth.	2212.56	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And maybe, maybe one landowner and him  and his, he and his wife would have a son	2217.54	6.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and he would know somebody on the next farm  over, and that man and his wife would have a	2224.14	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	daughter and they'd marry. They’d combine the  farms, and they would grow wealth that way.	2229.0	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	That was how the land economy worked. And then when the industrial revolution	2233.2	3.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	happened, we changed from a land  economy to a, an income economy.	2236.92	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We went from land to income, meaning that the  family farm, which was that thing that was passed	2243.04	6.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	from generation to generation, people didn't own  the family farm. Many people, didn't they, they	2249.1	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	gave up the family farm. They got jobs. They worked for companies, and they had	2253.24	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to rebuild their assets in other things. Along  with that farming economy you had commodities,	2257.44	6.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	these are the things that we need to, to live. They usually have a short timeframe.	2263.74	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Meaning these things are like wheat, grains,  pork bellies, beef, things that they have a	2268.24	6.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	short timeframe that you can use them. So as an  asset, they have the time that they're useful. You	2275.2	5.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	can sell them and make a profit but if you hold on  to them too long they won't be worth anything. And	2280.66	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	certainly, within commodities, you have industrial  metals and so on, those can exchange on that.	2285.76	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But in the sense of commodities, this  way, land is obviously a long-term thing,	2289.72	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and the commodities I'm referring to in  this case are more of the short-term things.	2293.56	3.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	If you go down to the bottom left, you'll see  metals there, and this is where you start to begin	2297.04	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to think through the difference, in real wealth,  if you will, versus other things. And that is,	2302.08	6.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	if you have bronze, bronze could be  a coin, but it could also be a tool.	2308.56	5.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It can be a weapon. It could be jewelry. You could take copper, you could take silver,	2313.78	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	you could take gold and you can use them for many  different things, and even though you might use	2319.06	4.62
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it as a coin to start with, if times became tough  and you need it for something else you could meld	2323.68	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	into something and then fashion it into something  that you could sell that had different value.	2328.6	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Then we go to trade, trade which would be  sort of like a, a commerce model typically non	2335.26	6.288
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	farming. It might be that somebody’s inventing  something, or somebody's producing something.	2341.548	5.592
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It may be that somebody's  building something, and maybe	2347.14	3.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they're distributing something, it's commerce. And having that thing that you do, that skill	2350.74	6.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	set to invent or to build, or to produce, or to  distribute. Those are skills that have value.	2357.28	7.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And that even if the, even if the economy  and the world collapsed, those would still	2365.26	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	be things that would be needed. And they represent a more	2370.06	3.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	traditional or tangible way to see wealth. Now, we compare that to more contemporary assets.	2373.12	7.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	These are more intangible. These are things that,  really, you can't actually hold, in many cases.	2380.32	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	They might be pieces of paper. They might be things that	2385.66	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	identify a title or registration. They might be a certificate. That	2388.96	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	expresses something. So, they're intangible. If modern society collapsed, some of them wouldn't	2394.24	6.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	be here. There might not be need for some of  these things, if the society collapsed. Some	2400.48	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	of them are still connected to something real but  that connection's diluted by layers of expenses,	2405.46	6.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	fees and management and people, some  aren't connected to anything real.	2411.7	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And these are bubbles that are in the modern  investment world, or, or wealth itself.	2416.56	6.12
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	The, the thing about them is, again, I'm  not painting them as bad, they're not, they,	2423.4	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they could be ways that people make huge amounts  of money, but they can also be ways that people	2428.98	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	lose money, too, because of the risk associated  with it that isn't so easily understood.	2434.56	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	If we look at some of the items  here, going back to metals for a	2440.5	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	second down here, this bottom circle,  possessions, trinkets, stuff, wares.	2443.8	6.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	You know it’s one thing to  have a solid gold bracelet.	2450.04	3.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It's another thing to have a trinket,  that looks like gold but really isn't.	2454.0	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And yet, you see people today who have more  of the latter and less of the, of the former.	2459.28	5.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	There's nothing wrong with  trinkets or stuff, or possessions.	2465.64	3.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It's just that they're not real. They  just look like facsimiles of what's real.	2468.7	5.94
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	They're not, that's why they're  not considered to be wealth.	2474.64	2.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	You've got banking, currency, which we talked  about currency a moment ago. Federal Reserve,	2477.7	5.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and the International Monetary Fund. These are processes, layers that create expenses	2483.16	6.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and fees and, and controls and complexities that  make it hard to tell where things are going.	2489.4	5.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	The banking system, pre-2020. If you took $100  into the bank, they had to keep $10 of it.	2495.1	7.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And I'm oversimplifying, but they  had to keep $10 of it in the bank.	2502.42	3.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And then they can loan out $90, which  meant, that's pretty cool, they could take,	2506.68	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they can pay you a little bit of interest  on your $100 and take $90 of it and go out	2510.82	5.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and charge a lot more interest. But they had to  keep a minimum of $10 in your, in your account.	2516.04	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Well, that changed after 2020.  It's now down to almost nothing.	2520.6	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	They can lend out the whole $100 now. So, what happens if things fall apart?	2526.18	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I mean, it's, I'm not saying they're going  to. But it is part of that thing that at	2531.1	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	some level we all are aware somehow that  something's different and it's concerning.	2535.24	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I already explained about currency, the  dollar that you and I have in our wallets,	2539.5	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	chances are it's not worth a dollar at  all. I mean, I say, chances are, it's not,	2544.78	3.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it's not worth a dollar anymore. It's a trust factor between us.	2548.32	3.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	That's why when you print more  and more of those pieces of paper,	2551.8	2.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	you're going to have more dollars chasing  fewer goods and it's going to create inflation.	2553.96	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	You take a look at stocks, stocks  represent ownerships in Companies.	2560.92	3.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	That’s great, there's nothing wrong with that,  people have made a lot of money doing that. But at	2564.4	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	the same time, you just have a small piece without  any say. It's a lot different than if you went in,	2568.36	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	in business with somebody who knew what they  were doing or maybe somebody joined you and	2572.62	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they brought capital, you brought your know-how.  There’s a lot more control in that. But the stocks	2576.94	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	do represent ownership, but it's just a piece  of paper that's connected to something real.	2581.14	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But we don't really understand what that realness  is sometimes. Exchanges, where you trade these	2584.98	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	stocks, mutual funds - which are pools of  these stocks, interval funds - which are a	2590.32	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	different way to create more stability by giving  up some liquidity, initial public offerings - or	2594.82	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	companies that want to go public and you're taking  a bigger risk, but you have more chance for gain.	2599.92	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Annuities, which can grow tax deferred,  they're offered by insurance companies.	2605.02	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	They represent models of other things, but  they have, they have guarantees, or riders,	2608.86	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	or stabilizers in them to protect against losses.  Cash value life insurance, also another asset	2613.9	6.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that can provide, but, but you don't really,  you know, most of the time people say, well,	2619.9	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I don't really know what it’s invested in. Again, that layer, that complexity,	2623.68	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	those are issues, not that they're bad. They just are. Financing, lending, leasing.	2628.84	7.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Those are another way that people make money,  whether you're loaning it to somebody or you're	2636.04	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	investing in some organization, and they loan it  out and give you back your money with interest.	2640.24	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Real Estate Investment Trusts,  up here at this, this bubble.	2645.34	3.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I don't mean bubble in the sense like it burst,  just that circle, that bucket, we'll call it. Real	2649.06	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Estate Investment Trusts, Collateral Mortgage,  Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, Collateral,	2653.86	6.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	goodness gracious, Distribution  Organizations. That's not right,	2660.58	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and then, but I’ll think what it is. But, and then Real Estate Limited	2665.26	3.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Partnerships represent real estate,  different ways to own real estate,	2668.62	3.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and you can diversify those into single family,  multi-family, storage, entertainment, commercial,	2671.98	7.38
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Class C, Class B, Class A, all kinds of different  investment opportunities there. But again, you're	2680.38	5.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	putting your money into a pool, not of stocks in  this case, but of actual real estate, but there's	2686.26	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	layers there, with additional fees and expenses. One thing to do it, that way, another thing to do,	2690.52	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	you go out and buy a piece of property  yourself, and you do all the work.	2695.92	2.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And then finally, the thing that kinda sort  of drove this whole conversation was crypto.	2699.16	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	one of the reasons I kind of hit this or decided  to hit this this way is this, is that crypto,	2704.02	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	as I said a moment ago is currently as a, an NGO,  a non-governmental organization making a promise	2708.82	6.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that they won’t increase the number of them,  but just like the federal government prints out	2715.0	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	more dollars, who’s to say that that organization  couldn't say well we're gonna, we're gonna double	2719.14	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it now, which cuts the value of it in half. Bitcoin, which you know many people have done	2723.4	5.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	very well with Bitcoin, and you know I get  it. It's a, it's an interesting investment,	2729.1	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	although the Government won’t define it  as an investment. They won't define it as	2733.84	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	a currency. They won't define it as, as any  sort of asset or a commodity, because they	2738.34	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	won't put any governmental organization over it. FTX, if you have been following anything lately,	2743.44	6.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	FTX, Sam Bankman Fried, whether it's because  he didn't understand what he was doing,	2749.68	6.42
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	or because he's just a big scammer lost, literally  billions of dollars, because he created a crypto	2756.1	7.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	model that fell apart, but fell apart in a  very catastrophic and incredibly large way.	2763.96	8.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And then CBDC’s - Central Banking Digital  Currency, which, depending on what you follow	2773.08	7.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	about things of this nature, it's a desire that  someday there might be a governmental crypto.	2780.88	3.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But then what that means is that every  transaction you and I do it run through	2784.6	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	a digital model, that it can all be seen. You have dollars in your wallet, you spend	2789.76	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	them now, nobody knows what you do with them. But you run it through a crypto model where the	2794.26	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	government can see everything that scares  some people. And again, then what do we	2799.0	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	really have? Do we have something backed by  anything, or is it just backed by a promise?	2803.08	3.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, when we look at contemporary assets,  I'm not, I'm not making any judgement,	2807.46	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	whether these are good or bad, again, all of them  have made money, and many of them have lost money.	2812.02	6.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It's not that they're good or bad. It's just understanding the complexities	2819.1	2.94
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	of them in light of how traditional assets work,  and how their connection to them is so critical.	2822.04	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	That, that, I wanted to say, this is  a part of what I think is happening.	2827.62	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	In this, in this lack of, or  this problematic connection	2832.78	2.94
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	between Wall Street, Main Street, and your Street. Because all of these assets have more complexities	2835.72	5.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and controls attached to them. There's influences  that drive them that may not be obvious to us.	2841.6	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Interest that is connected to them. Inflation  can, can eat away at them quickly, because they	2846.4	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	don't have anything real attached to some of them. Expenses, taxes, volatile nature of some of them.	2851.5	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	These are the things that, when we're  looking at how we invest in today's world,	2857.08	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we have to really start thinking about, what  is real wealth and how do I do this in a way	2861.82	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that gives my family the best opportunity to  create, grow, protect, and preserve wealth?	2865.6	5.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	How’re we doing on time here, oh ok  goodness, so, so what is real wealth?	2872.92	4.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Well, what this is right here, these  are calculations I mention that when	2876.94	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Wall Street looks at things, what they  do is they look at return on assets,	2880.78	2.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	which is a particular calculation  that they use, or return on equity.	2883.6	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	When you look at value investing, which  is what Warren Buffett or others of his	2889.48	4.2
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	nature would focus on, these are things that  you're looking at to try to figure out if a	2893.68	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	company is intrinsically worth more than what  is currently trading for on the stock exchange.	2897.94	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And the belief is if you buy it at  that lower level, sooner or later,	2904.06	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it'll catch up, but that's not true either. I  mean, sometimes it does catch up. Maybe many times	2907.3	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it catches up, but sometimes it doesn't. So, return on assets, return on equity,	2911.62	4.62
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	return on investment and you can see there's  two different models for calculation there.	2916.24	3.12
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Those are the kind of, the kind of ideas  and concepts that drive Wall Street.	2919.36	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And again, there's nothing wrong with it. I'm going to keep saying that because I don't want	2925.12	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to say that this is good and that's bad, because  many, everything that I've shown you has had has	2930.46	6.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	made somebody money, including FTX, the original  people in FTX, they made money. If they got out,	2936.52	5.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they kept that money. If they didn't, they  lost it, though so items making money,	2941.98	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	or losing money is just part of the process. But for the investor or their advisors to	2946.24	6.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	understand it, to me is what's critical  when we look at what is real wealth.	2952.42	3.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I mentioned to you, youthful capital versus  experiential capital and what I'd like to do is	2957.7	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	suggest that there is one other piece to this,  and this actually came from Jordan Peterson,	2961.78	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	if you know who he is, a podcast he did. He talked about how, a 22-year-old man,	2966.7	5.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	who has had, is healthy and likes to work and  wants to, to go out and make his mark on the	2972.34	7.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	world, or it could be a girl to a woman. The same  thing 22-year-old woman could do the same thing.	2979.78	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	They have a huge amount of wealth locked  inside of them that hasn't yet shown itself.	2983.74	5.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And so, that, that wealth  for youthful capitalists,	2990.4	2.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	time value of working capital if those people,  those young people are driven to succeed.	2992.98	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	If they're visionary, innovating, progressive, and  they're thinking and able to see opportunities,	2997.54	6.06
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	acutely aware of previous generation shortcomings,	3003.6	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that's part of the problem for them. They  see our failures and they say I can fix that.	3006.84	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And sometimes they have unwarranted confidence  in the future and maybe in themselves, they,	3011.4	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they think they've got it all figured out their  25 years old. They don't know hardly anything yet.	3016.74	4.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But that doesn't mean they don't have a good idea,  and they have minimal experience with failure,	3020.76	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	so they don't quite understand  how painful failure can be yet.	3025.44	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	At the same time, on the other side of  that equation, is experiential capital.	3030.24	3.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	That's the older people of us listening, because  we have, we have that capital for investment,	3034.8	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	those young people, all they have  is time, and drive for capital.	3039.9	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We have the actual capital to work with, we’re  driven to succeed just like they are. But we have	3043.68	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	some other thoughts behind that, we’re visionary. We’re mature, we’re conservative because we've	3048.72	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	seen things work, and we’ve seen things fail,  but we've also recognized that every successful	3052.68	6.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	person at one time had that youthful capital. We're acutely aware of current generation	3058.68	6.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	shortcomings. We can see what  they do wrong, and it scares us.	3064.68	3.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But sometimes we miss opportunity because  we're not looking carefully at it.	3068.94	3.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Sometimes we're overly confident in our past  successes, and we have fear of failure because	3072.3	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we've been kicked in the teeth a few times. Having said all that, you put these two	3077.7	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	groups together, with intelligence and  with maturity, and you can create some	3082.62	5.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	huge wealth with that. And we've certainly  seen that with a lot of different things,	3088.38	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	even in the last two decades. Many of the things  that you and I buy today didn't exist before 2000.	3091.62	6.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Starting with that, that phone that you  have. These things didn't exist before,	3098.16	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but because you had youthful capital,  had one idea, and experiential capital	3102.42	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	had another idea and they came together. That's an important piece of this discussion	3106.26	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	as well and trying to figure out how those fit  also has a lot to do with what is real wealth.	3110.34	4.62
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So that brings me to the second  part with all these little circles.	3115.98	2.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, if there is a problematic economy, how are  we investing in this challenging environment?	3118.56	5.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Well, one thing is we try to diversify. We  try to identify what our clients' needs are,	3124.26	6.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	what your needs are. We try to invest with  that in mind, and then we try to stay as	3130.5	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	closely connected to the real as we can. And we try to, if we're going to move away	3135.36	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	from the real to get some things like a, a,  stock, or an insurance program, or something	3140.52	5.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	of that nature, a Real Estate Investment Trust. We try to make sure there are stabilizers and	3146.28	5.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	protections built inside of it that give  us a better chance if things go sideways.	3151.98	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Because that's the best we can do. I mean, we could watch a TV show where	3157.14	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	the host says, buy, buy, buy, and go out and  buy that stock, but that person is going to	3162.24	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	have no responsibility in that process, and if it  doesn't work tomorrow, well, I'm sorry, but tune	3167.64	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	in tomorrow night, I'll tell you something new. But in reality, what we want to do is take a	3171.96	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	look at what works, what's connected to real as  much as possible, what provides stabilizers and	3177.0	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	protections, and then diversify to not put  all of our eggs in one basket, because some	3181.68	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	things are gonna work really well, and some  things might not. But we want to diversify	3186.72	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to give us the best chance to make that work. That's what a professional fiduciary process	3190.02	5.52
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	would look like using multiple approaches  rather than just stocks or bonds or cash.	3195.54	5.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So that brings me to the last question:  What is real wealth? Well, sure,	3203.04	3.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	real wealth would be return on assets,  return on equity, return on investments.	3206.52	3.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But what I would suggest is real  wealth is actually return on life.	3209.88	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It can't be calculated. All we can do is estimate  it. And here's what I would say, if you look down	3215.34	5.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	at this bottom paragraph, it's right here. We won't be thinking about ROA or ROE or ROI,	3220.56	5.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	as we take our last few  breaths of air on this planet.	3226.44	2.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We'll be thinking about what we did with  what we have, the experiences that we went	3228.72	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	through that are worth remembering and the  people we love or should have loved more.	3233.76	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	That's ROL and I think that's  what real wealth looks like.	3238.56	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I think that, that to understand  the other pieces is critical.	3242.64	4.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But it's crucial to really know what it is we're  trying to do with whatever wealth it is we have.	3246.66	6.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	On our Retirementality program, we use with  people. We identify a number of things that	3253.74	6.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	people are thinking about as they start to move  through various phases in their life. Our goal as	3259.74	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	financial planners, as wealth advisors, is to help  people think about what do I want to do this year?	3265.14	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	What do I want to do in the next five years?  What do I want to do? What's my bucket list?	3270.48	4.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And so, what is real wealth well it's ROL. What  type of return on life are you looking for?	3274.5	5.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	ROI is critical, you have to  have good return on investment,	3282.0	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	no doubt about it. But ROL is crucial.	3285.3	2.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And that's why we've been moving along this  path, to go to an advisory viewpoint, not just	3287.94	5.52
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	for investments, but for wealth in general. And that's kind of the strategy that I	3293.46	6.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	decided tonight to look at, to say, is there  something problematic in the economy? I think	3299.76	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	everybody realizes there's something  going on that's a little challenging.	3303.72	3.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	How do we offset that to the best of our  ability? And then what does real wealth	3306.9	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	look like? It looks like the ability for  you to do the things you felt called to do,	3311.4	3.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	so that as we check out on this planet someday,  we're like, I did what I wanted, I did what I	3314.94	4.68
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	thought was right, I did what I thought was best. Create, grow, protect, and preserve wealth.	3319.62	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	The three phases of our journey; is first  the accumulation phase where we build wealth,	3326.1	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	build wealth, build wealth, and then  somewhere down the road, we can't,	3331.08	2.52
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we don't have the capacity to go out and do the  work anymore in the way we did before. Then we	3333.6	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	have to decumulate, that's when we retire, and  so, we have to make sure we got enough to get	3338.1	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	through the first five years of our planning,  because those are crucial to make sure we have	3343.38	4.56
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	enough money to last for the rest of our life. We have to make sure our end-of-life risk is	3347.94	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	wisely thought out so that if we die and our  spouse is left here, they've got resources.	3352.68	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Want to make sure as we check out, that we  have achieved our desired return on life,	3357.72	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and that then, let what's left we can transfer  it to those people that we love and care about.	3363.06	4.74
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	That's what this sort of  advisory thinking is about.	3367.8	4.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	On our website, I've gone a little bit over,  I was gonna spend some time on the website,	3372.6	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it’s not over yet, but it's about to be. I'll just remind you of this, but I wanted	3377.64	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to take you to the website and  show you some of our things.	3380.88	2.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I'm going to save that for next month, where  I will spend more time touring our website,	3383.52	3.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but I would encourage you to realize  we've got some really awesome things,	3387.18	3.24
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and the first of all, we got our whole  team on there now, and we've got these,	3390.42	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	these pod-, these webinars are on there.  We try to get them on within 30 days,	3394.2	5.52
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we gotta get approval from our broker dealer and  so on, so we can't just like stick it on there,	3399.72	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but we're working through that, but we got most  of them up there until the end of this last year.	3403.56	3.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We also have other resources we use, one of  those companies is called Real Wealth. It's	3408.24	3.6
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	on there. I do, I do a blog every week. Let me just take one second here to	3411.84	5.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	do this and stop it, go back over there. I want to get you out of here quick, but I do	3417.6	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	want to show you. So, this is our website. If you go to Menu	3422.76	3.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	here, I’ve already showed you the login  pages. But I'll talk about this next month.	3427.86	5.04

kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we got different things you can do. This is  where you go and log into all of your accounts.	3436.92	3.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Educational Resources. We got the Market  Update Videos, these we’ve saved those on	3440.28	5.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	there for a few months, so you can watch them.  Real Wealth Podcast, which isn't connected to	3445.56	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	what I was saying, what is real wealth, but they  are a great resource that we really love to use.	3449.88	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Have a blog that you can go to and every  every, every week we put on a new update,	3454.38	8.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So you can go on there and read that. Some of  you are getting these through your e-mails,	3462.96	3.3

kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	protect and preserve wealth, and  this is part of how we do that.	3473.64	2.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Alright, so in bringing this to a close  today, as I shared with you last time,	3477.66	6.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we really are focused on the return on life  planning process. We believe that as a fiduciary	3484.02	6.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	wealth advisory process is going to require  a vigorous financial planning strategy. I'm	3490.8	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	already working through that with dozens of you  right now because we're at the first of the year.	3495.6	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	If you've not had your appointment yet to update  your, your annual service agreement and take a	3500.04	6.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	look at your planning process, and how  we're handling wealth advisory for you,	3506.4	3.36
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	please give a call, let Kayla schedule  you time so we can sit down talk about it.	3509.76	3.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It's, I love it, I gotta tell you, it is  it, it really brings investment and risk	3513.42	6.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	management processes together and is fan, just  a fantastic way. I love the conversation I'm	3520.08	6.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	having with clients about this process,  and I hope you'll, you'll love it, too.	3526.26	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, let me stop there and say, do we have any  questions? I'm just going to quickly check	3530.22	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to see if we have any questions in chat. Uh, nope, don’t see any questions there.	3535.08	7.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Don’t see any questions there. So, I'm gonna close out for a second.	3542.1	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But if you do, go ahead and chat them in, or raise  your hand, or whatever, and I'll come back to it.	3546.06	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, our next advisory review  will be in March on the 21st.	3554.4	7.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We're going to talk more about how  we're helping clients to create, grow,	3561.72	3.12
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	protect, and preserve wealth. Give you more  understanding of fundamentals and technical	3564.84	4.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	analytics for the market and the economy. Show you some more of the solutions that we're	3568.86	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	using to help keep tax money on your side of the,  of the table, and keep fees and expenses lower, so	3573.12	6.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that way it's easier to keep your wealth growing.  And then, obviously, take time to answer questions	3579.6	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that come out of out of our meetings with  you, and even some of the e-mails you send us.	3583.74	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, we took time to review the market and the  economy. I hope that was helpful. I know it was,	3589.2	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it was probably like drinking out of a firehose.  And like I said, I could've talked on that whole	3594.0	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	part of, that whole process with that and what  is real wealth, I could probably talk on that	3598.26	4.62
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	for four hours tonight, because I think it's  such a fascinating and critical conversation.	3602.88	5.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	But I wanted to just to give you enough  to really sort of whet your appetite,	3608.28	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	maybe cause you to look for a few more things,  and certainly give you questions to ask if	3613.14	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	there's anything that we can help with on that. Went through our website a little bit. I'm	3617.64	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	gonna do more of that next month  because I just ran out of time.	3622.8	2.28
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I gave you some of my reflections on what I  thinks happening and what we're looking at doing.	3625.08	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And then, oh, I see a question came up,  so I was just about to say, we're going	3629.16	3.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to answer your questions, and let’s see here,  I don’t see a question, I see a hand raised.	3632.82	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	That's not it. Questions, go to chat, I saw a hand go up.	3639.78	5.97
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Oh, I know what it is, OK. Gotcha,  alright, let me see if I can.	3645.75	2.85
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Diane, looks like you want to talk, can you,  can you talk? You might have to unmute yourself.	3649.44	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I might even be able to unmute you. My question is,	3656.64	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	what is our current currency money backed by?	3660.72	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I'm sorry, I heard part of  that question, say that again.	3664.98	3.12
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	OK, so what is our current currency backed by? It is backed by the full faith and credit of	3668.1	9.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	the United States government’s  ability to tax it's citizens.	3677.4	4.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	It would be fair to say that there are assets  that the United States of America owns and	3682.8	5.34
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	possibly those could be brought into the mix. But if we were to have a conversation about	3688.14	5.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	the Federal Reserve and how it works, and  what the currency itself is backed by,	3693.84	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it really isn't backed, like, it was in years,  and this is not a statement about President Nixon,	3699.78	8.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but he was the one who took this off  the gold standard, and prior to that,	3707.94	3.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	the US Dollar was attached to metals, um, prior  to that, or after that, it stopped being that way.	3711.6	8.4
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	There's also a fascinating story if you're ever  interested, Abraham Lincoln to fund the Civil War,	3720.0	6.66
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	went to the bankers in New York to  try to borrow money to fund the war,	3727.62	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they wanted to charge him 20, 25% interest. So, he came back and he was furious, and so	3731.88	6.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	one of his Cabinet Secretary said, you know, you  don't need to run it through the Federal Reserve	3738.72	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	you can back it by the, by the, the  assets of the United States of America.	3742.98	4.5
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, for the only time in our history,  it was actually for those dollar bills,	3747.48	5.22
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	those, that currency during the Civil  War, some of that currency was backed	3752.7	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	by the direct assets of the United  States of America. Today not so much.	3758.28	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	OK, so, what would you say is the best  asset backing available in this day in time?	3763.92	9.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Oh well, for one thing, there's  no currency on the, on the, in the	3773.64	5.94
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	world that is backed by gold or precious metals. It's all backed by the taxing authority or the,	3779.58	7.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	the, the assets, if you will, in a sort  of circumvented view of those nations.	3786.66	5.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Um, so here's the problem with this thing and  I'm gonna, I'm gonna answer this question.	3793.62	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And I'm gonna go ahead and have to go home,  because the truth is this is a big question.	3798.42	3.84
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	If you're really interested, you might want to,  and I don't know if you can find it anymore,	3803.1	3.18
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but there's a long video like four hours.  It's called the Federal Reserve: Not Federal,	3806.28	5.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	No Reserve and it does a really good  job of explaining how currency works.	3811.92	4.98
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Um, having said that though, here's what I would  say, is that the, the dollar bill in my wallet	3818.04	10.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and the dollar bill in your wallet is a means  of commerce and exchange for goods and services.	3829.08	5.52
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	We trust that, and we accept it. So, if I  hand you a dollar, if you want a dollar for	3835.62	6.48
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	something and I hand it to you, and you give  me something back in exchange, we accept that.	3842.1	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	That is, that, that's a, a commerce model. It's a commerce model. How much is your car	3847.32	6.78
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	worth? Well, it's worth whatever  somebody will pay you for it.	3854.1	2.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	How much is, is $1 worth, well it’s worth  whatever somebody will take for in exchange	3856.68	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	for goods or service. Being backed by the federal  government is in essence, in some ways not real,	3861.54	8.7
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	but in other ways, it's very real because,  they print the money, they control the money,	3870.24	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	they don't, they do everything they can to make  sure that the counterfeiters can't produce more,	3875.04	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and more, and more of it, and then totally devalue  it and we don't know what's real and what's not.	3878.94	4.02
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, they do protect it, but the  problem is, is that it's not,	3882.96	4.32
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	it's not backed by an asset like we would like. And, I would just say, quite honestly, we'll	3887.28	5.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	probably never go back to that. I can't foresee a  time when we'll ever be able to get back to that,	3892.74	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	that model again. But, who knows,	3897.78	2.82
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I guess, weirder things have happened. So, I would say, don't let this cause you to lose	3900.6	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	sleep at night. It's not that kind of a thing, but  just realize that when you invest money, we should	3905.04	5.46
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	invest in things that have as much connection to  real, or have stabilizers, rider's protections	3910.5	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	on it, that we have confidence can be guaranteed. And so that's how I would lead that conversation.	3915.66	5.64
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Again, there's just, this conversation  goes so askew if I go farther with it.	3922.32	5.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I would just simply say, don't lose sleep  tonight, keep doing what you're doing and	3928.2	4.8
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	just make the best decisions to try to  stay connected to traditional assets,	3933.0	3.96
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	or with protections, that you have confidence you  can trust, as a way to invest for the long term.	3936.96	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And, honestly, that's what we do every day here. That's all we can do, is try to pick out the	3943.5	4.26
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	good from the bad, make the most of it, try  to create the best model for our clients,	3947.76	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	so they can create, grow, protect, and preserve  wealth, and that's the best all of us can do.	3952.68	5.04
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	So, you know, don't take that as a bad  thing. It's just the way it is. So,	3958.74	4.08
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	we'll make the best of it just like you are. All right, that was a good question,	3962.82	6.0
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Diane and I get it and I wish we had a better  answer for you, but that's just the way it is	3968.82	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	right now and so that's why we work really  hard to try to make sure that everything	3973.26	3.9
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	is as optimal as it can be. Not perfect. Excellent. We shoot for the best all the time.	3977.16	5.88
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	All right, well, I've run over by seven  minutes, so I'm going to jump off of here.	3984.18	4.86
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	Again, it was my pleasure  to share with you tonight.	3989.04	3.3
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I look forward to sharing some more of this  and some other items that we've got working on	3992.34	3.54
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	for our upcoming Investment Advisory for you. And so, between now and then if you have any	3995.88	5.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	questions, you can certainly e-mail us. You can  e-mail kayla@franksoffice.com and she'll be happy	4001.64	5.16
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to get those to me. Or if you want, just call and  schedule a meeting, we'll be happy to sit down and	4006.8	4.44
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	talk with you and help answer these questions and  help you figure out what you're going to do too,	4011.24	4.92
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	and remember, this is what the real wealth  is, to create the best return on life you	4016.16	5.1
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	can with what you have, with your income and  your outgo, what you own, and what you owe,	4021.26	5.58
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	to make the most of it, to accomplish all the  things that you're trying to do in your life.	4026.84	4.14
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	And that's my pleasure to help  you do that. So, with that,	4031.76	2.76
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	I think I'm gonna go get some dinner. And  I will look forward to talking to you soon,	4034.52	3.72
kJINSvTwg6M	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJINSvTwg6M	at least on March 21st, if not before. So, have a  great evening. I'll talk with you soon, God bless.	4038.24	6.18
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	Welcome to Connecting Nodes. A new podcast we  are launching today, where we aim to connect the	37.32	28.44
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	world of investors and builders. What are  the founders building today? Where is the	65.76	5.34
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	innovation going? What potential new themes  and trends are emerging? And for investors,	71.1	5.82
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	what does the world of digital assets look like?  Not only today, but in 1, 3, 5, or even 10 years	76.92	7.5
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	down the road. This is educational, these are  obviously our points of view, we are extrapolating	84.42	6.36
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	a lot of information and data not only from our  work, Michal and I both from on our early stage	90.78	5.58
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	venture fund, but also from the conversations  we're having with founders, and with builders,	96.36	5.46
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	around the world of digital assets. We  look forward to sharing that information,	101.82	4.14
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	we'll try and make this fun. And with that, let's  get right to it. So in Q1 of 2023, from a venture	105.96	6.84
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	perspective, pejoratively, early stage, series, A,  maybe a few series B, we wanted to give you a few	112.8	6.9
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	data points here. And then we're gonna talk about  trends. And we're going to talk about themes that	119.7	3.84
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	we're seeing. But in Q1 of 2023, just get a recap  here. So we've seen about for 245 deals emerge	123.54	10.38
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	over the last quarter, roughly about $2 billion  have been deployed into deals in the sector.	133.92	6.66
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	This as a comparison to Q1 stats, one in 2022.  We saw 543 deals and roughly $14 billion deployed	141.36	9.9
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	into deals. This is a rather large redux of  deal activity and capital flows. However,	151.26	6.06
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	there's some good information in the data  points here that will go through very quickly.	157.32	3.72
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	In the last three months in January,  February, March of 2023. In January,	162.42	6.12
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	we saw roughly 75 deals completed roughly about  $566 million invested. However, in February,	168.54	7.56
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	we saw 97 deals completed for almost $900 million,  roughly about $856 million. And then in March,	176.1	8.7
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	we've now seen about 54 deals completed for about  $480 million. I want to bring this as a point	184.8	6.66
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	though, because we are seeing a significant amount  of capital flows relative to the last time we had	191.46	5.22
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	quote unquote, crypto winter, where these numbers  were magical in compared to those years in 2019.	196.68	8.22
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	Many people in this space couldn't even imagine  these numbers back then. And so these numbers are	206.34	4.74
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	representing some significant flows into  infrastructure, for instance, that is an	211.08	4.2
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	emergent trend in the sectors and sectors here in  digital assets. Infrastructure is capturing the	215.28	7.02
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	lion's share of deal flow and capital. In January  we saw 23 deals roughly $327 million dollars in	222.3	7.26
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	infrastructure. And in February, we saw 22 deals  roughly $239 million of infrastructure. And in	229.56	7.14
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	March, we saw six deals of $75 million going  into infrastructure. So that is where we're	236.7	5.1
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	seeing a lot of the inflows going. Now before I  go to Michal I want to talk on some of the trends	241.8	4.74
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	and some of the capital formations and flows  and valuations that we're seeing as well, too.	246.54	4.32
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	I wanted to just outline February because  as I said, February was an outlier. We saw	250.86	4.86
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	in January of $166 million investment then in  February, we saw in $856 million invested. And	255.72	6.3
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	so there were a few things there in February that  caught my eye when we were looking at data. There	262.02	5.52
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	is one deal Taurus, which raised $65 million in  their series B from Deutsche Bank, Tay and others.	267.54	7.14
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	What is Taurus? They claim to be the leading  digital asset infrastructure provider for	275.82	4.92
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	financial institutions in Europe. They handle  things like custody, they handle things like	280.74	6.24
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	tokenization. And they also claim to have a  regulated marketplace there as well to why I call	286.98	6.18
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	this out and we're going to talk more about this  later, is the emphasis on Europe. This is going	293.16	4.86
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	to have a conversation I'm going to have about  regulatory impact that we have here in the United	298.02	3.42
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	States and things around the world. So Taurus is  very interesting. I think some of the investors in	301.44	4.74
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	that we're definitely very interesting to note. A  few others very quickly here, Carbon Place raised	306.18	5.64
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	$45 million from BNParba, Bank Itau, NatWest and  a group of other banks. What is it? Carbon credit	311.82	7.5
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	transaction network which connects buyers and  sellers through their banks. And they recognized	319.32	6.06
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	as banks or need for true collaboration between  financial sector and other corporate marketplace	325.38	5.46
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	participants to bring trust, transparency and  access to the voluntary corporate marketplace.	330.84	4.92
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	The last one Superplastic raised $20 million  in an extension round and I bring this up only	335.76	5.76
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	because some of the investors here are really  interesting. Amazon Alexa's fund, Google,	341.52	4.8
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	and Craft ventures plus more. And so this is  a home of synthetic superstars, what they call	346.32	5.88
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	janky and glucomannan and the world's premier  creator of Digital Designer toys and apparel.	352.2	5.76
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	So not only are we seeing some pretty big  checks and pretty big rounds here in February,	358.5	5.1
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	but we're seeing some fairly affluent investors,  institutional investors, Deutsche Bank, Pick Teh,	363.6	5.46
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	Google, Amazon Alexa, though there is significant  institutional involvement still in this space.	369.06	5.88
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	And with that me, why don't you take us through  some of the trends and themes that we're seeing.	374.94	4.38
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	Certainly trying to dig into the numbers a  little bit more and kind of peer the curtain	381.6	6.18
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	as to what might be driving some of those big  delta and swings that we have seen from January,	387.78	4.32
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	February, back to March, primarily as we look at  private markets deals, and there is a significant	392.1	6.72
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	element of lag that often isn't, frankly, talked  much about, some of the founders very well erode	398.82	7.74
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	that many of the investors are but due to  public that perhaps is not in day in day	406.56	6.96
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	out deal mode that might be lost, oftentimes,  sometime. So what we have seen primarily in	413.52	6.36
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	the private markets is that pretty significant  lag or I would call it anywhere between two to	419.88	6.12
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	three quarters historically, this time around  looking closer to three quarters, behind where	426.0	5.52
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	the liquid markets and kind of in that token  world has been deals in particularly private	431.52	7.8
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	markets have been following that that pattern as  well. And so there are no only the price volume	439.32	6.72
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	of those transactions that has dipped. There is  also another element. And I think something that	446.04	6.6
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	you pointed out to some of the rounds that have  been completed, especially in Q1 of this year,	452.64	5.64
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	tend to be actually a lot less chunky, almost kind  of a later stage of of kind of the spectrum of	459.48	7.56
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	the companies that we have seen. And with those  primarily and the names that you have, you have	467.04	5.7
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	listed of participating investors, we are actually  seeing quite a quite an incredible trend of how	472.74	7.98
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	investing in digital assets infrastructure, as  no longer been carrying a lot of carrier risk for	480.72	8.28
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	many of those investors, especially investors that  are seeing this as a future underpinning layer	489.0	6.36
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	for a lot of the very well known ways of selling  products selling products to the market and a form	495.36	6.36
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	of digital assets and easing easing that access  all the way to really retail facing real facing	501.72	10.62
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	elements of engagement with digital assets and the  examples of Superplastic he quoted. So I would,	512.34	7.08
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	I would kind of look back at what has happened  in Q1 from kind of several lenses. One,	519.42	6.24
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	real institutions actually taking a position  and long term view as to where digital assets	526.68	5.58
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	infrastructure plays fit into kind of their  book of existing investments. But to also	532.26	6.6
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	look at the trends behind the ebbs and flows  of retail participation in the space. We opened	538.86	7.2
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	up this year with really speculation being back  in vogue, just rewinding clock back. Retail has	546.06	6.78
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	shown significant signs of life especially driven  by Asia, that we in liquid side of the market we	552.84	6.48
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	have seen a number of AI coins, casino coins, low  liquidity, very thinly traded volatility coins,	559.32	7.86
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	take a lion's share of participants in the  market. Now what has happened in the illiquid	568.08	7.56
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	side of the market is that we have witnessed a  valuation rewrite, valuation rewrites that we'll	575.64	7.56
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	talk about here in a second. Last year has been  primarily driven by two events. implosion of Terra	583.2	6.96
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	Luna ecosystem was the first one and of course FTX  saga in starting November was the second one. Now	590.16	8.04
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	we have a third event that just has happened two  weeks ago that we're still processing and reacting	598.2	7.2
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	to and that has been the rapid the banking of a  lot of us projects and startups with that meant	605.4	6.9
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	a lot of evaluations have been getting depressed  or essentially rewriting in reaction and in direct	612.3	7.68
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	response to the behavior that we have seen  from investors that are starting to kind of	619.98	5.28
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	hedge their bets and be extremely sensitive  to the entry point on the valuation spectrum.	625.26	4.32
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	Yep, a lot to unpack there, my friend lot to  unpack there. One of the things I always love	632.1	5.28
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	and we'll see if maybe we can put a grab of  this one we put this out is there was a great	637.38	7.32
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	chart from Union Square Ventures a prolific  VC for the last 20, 30 years. Fred Wilson,	644.7	8.94
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	the team over there, fantastic, Nick Grossman,  a few years ago, posted this. And I remember	653.64	6.48
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	this when I was starting to dabble in the world  of digital assets, is the infrastructure phase	660.12	6.24
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	out the myth of the infrastructure phase, but  for all intensive purposes, we'll just talk	667.14	3.06
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	about it the infrastructure phase. And  so it goes back all the way to the 70s,	670.2	3.72
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	where you had messaging and email in 1970,  in 1972, supported by infrastructure later	673.92	6.54
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	on after that with Ethernet, TCP IP at ISPs. Then  in the 90s, you had things like AOL, but AOL was	680.46	8.04
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	needed to have more infrastructure in terms of  things like Mosaic, which became Netscape, Lycos,	688.5	6.36
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	and active active is AltaVista and Google search.  So the multiples, find things on the internet.	694.86	5.76
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	And then you go further and further down the road  until, you know apps like Uber and FanDuel, and	702.0	6.3
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	Instagram and Snapchat, that needed infrastructure  like MongoDB, and open SSL and Stripe and	708.3	7.44
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	Cloudflare. So it's a give and take, you build  something amazing, you build a few things amazing.	715.74	7.56
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	And then all of a sudden, you realize you need to  have the infrastructure to support it. So getting	723.3	3.84
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	back to kind of where we were seeing a lot of that  capital flow, I think it makes absolute perfect	727.14	3.6
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	sense that we've gotten to a point where there is  interest, we have millions of people around the	730.74	5.46
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	world that have digital assets and wallets. We've  seen the rise of things like Axie Infinity as a	736.2	6.12
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	game and the space, I've gotten 3 million daily  active users. And then we've seen that there have	742.32	3.6
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	been some issues with that from an infrastructure  and economic and tokenomics level. And so this is	745.92	5.28
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	a given take this is very normal in the evolution  of technology and the adoption of technology. And	751.2	8.22
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	so that's really, I think, one point, I wanted  to nestle off on to that one, in terms of what	759.42	5.58
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	you're talking about in terms of valuations in  terms of durations, yes, it makes absolute sense.	765.0	4.62
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	What we're seeing across the board is that, you  know, from a regulatory clarity perspective,	770.76	4.98
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	we don't really have a lot of regulatory clarity  here in the United States. We've been asking for	775.74	4.32
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	it for years, and we need to ask for it. But  what's happening is that you have a lot of the	780.06	5.76
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	founders who want to decentralize and want to  do have distributed networks, but they need to	785.82	5.04
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	have that visa vie some sort of a token that they  can provide that to those that are participating	790.86	4.98
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	in the network. That's also very supportive of  bringing people up into society, bringing people	795.84	7.2
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	up economically, you know, you're letting them  participate in these networks, they haven't been	803.04	4.44
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	able to see that before with, you know, Uber  and Airbnb where they've been doing the work	807.48	4.56
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	of the network, but they don't really have the  economic upside of that company or that project.	812.04	4.56
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	And so we can't really do that a lot here, because  we don't have the clarity is in terms of what the	817.2	5.82
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	regulator, the regulators think, is it a security,  not security, has it become decentralized.	823.02	5.28
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	And so there's so many things in flux  right now. And so in terms of, you know,	829.56	4.44
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	the regulatory issues that may have alluded to,  we're also seeing, you know, very significant	834.0	4.5
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	interest in things are happening in Europe  with MiCA, where you're seeing the regulatory	838.5	6.84
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	framework for the European Parliament, take the  last few years of work, inspection discovery,	845.34	5.28
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	and try to come up with regulatory patterns  that make sense for growth of the industry.	850.62	4.56
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	And so we're seeing that, but that's not going to  happen, you know, they're gonna vote on that and	856.56	4.14
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	gonna happen, hopefully, in April of this year,  but you know, it's gonna take some time for that	860.7	5.04
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	to become manifested to really become the law of  the land to become workable. So you have that as	865.74	5.46
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	an issue. And so you have some of these things, with a very significant implications and knock on	871.2	6.3
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	effect as to how investors are thinking of kind  of positioning themselves. And more importantly,	877.5	4.62
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	in our world, how are the founders reacting  in response to some of these potentially new,	882.12	6.54
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	restrictive, but nevertheless, frameworks that  you can reference in your built in design of	889.5	6.06
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	your product and offering. One element in relation  to what you've just mentioned, David, that jumps	895.56	5.94
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	out at me as for as long as I can remember being  involved in this space, Europe has never been seen	901.5	6.12
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	as as the bastion of hope for this industry was  historically a little bit of the opposite. And	908.46	5.82
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	if anything, it has been more of a laggard, and  a follower, did a pace set by the founders and	914.28	6.24
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	projects out of the US. And dare I say some of  the regulators that that were perhaps a little	920.52	4.92
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	bit more progressive. Now, there was certainly  wind of change, and that is very unfortunate for	925.44	6.06
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	being particular US based and wanting to run your  business out of an onshore entity here in America,	931.5	7.32
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	given the environment that you are thrown into  today. One where a not only your Brooklyn,	938.82	8.22
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	to position yourself operationally with banks  shattering or I tried sending you cashier's	948.18	7.8
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	checks and mail one way, was signifying kind  of want that a one way relationship. But more	955.98	5.52
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	importantly, how do you ultimately envision  not only bringing your product to the market,	961.5	6.66
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	but then ultimately seeing an act of engagement  from retail with with your product, or even other	968.16	6.9
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	institutions that are also very much responsive to  that framework. So what David has been referring	975.06	8.94
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	to as the new regulatory framework is called  Markets and Crypto Assets are the acronym of MiCA	984.0	7.14
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	framework coming in Europe, others getting  voted on by European Parliament next month. Now,	991.74	5.46
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	the timeline here is also very important.  The moment this gets voted into a law	997.2	5.04
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	and gets promulgated within a 30 day window post  vote, it will take time before it will become law.	1003.26	6.12
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	So just to give you an example, there are several  elements in the bill that relates to stablecoins	1009.38	6.36
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	as well as other digital assets, the stable coin  piece of regulation actually comes out 12 months	1015.74	6.48
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	after the promulgation of that bill into law. Now  with reference to the other elements of that bill,	1022.22	6.0
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	classification of digital assets, standards for  your white paper issuance, or any token insurance	1028.22	6.72
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	in the market, those will become standard and 18  months from now. So really looking for me over	1034.94	5.22
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	Q4 of 2024. But it's time to essentially position  yourselves and have an opinion, I would argue is	1040.16	6.48
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	now and this is something we're ultimately urging  both of our founders, this was fellow investors to	1046.64	6.42
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	get up the curve and understand the ramifications  of this new world or coming out of Europe.	1053.06	5.4
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	I agree, it's, there's again, a lot of things  in flux. There's a lot of really important	1060.32	8.64
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	pieces that are being put out there. We've seen  other countries around the world like Hong Kong,	1068.96	4.26
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	saying that they're open open their  doors to the world to digital assets,	1073.22	3.72
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	we've seen a significant influx of interest in  Latin America. And so as we are in this pause	1076.94	8.76
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	period right now of the United States trying to  figure its way going forward, whether that is more	1085.7	6.78
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	restrictive or not. It is having a cascading  effect on valuations here, as you alluded to,	1092.48	6.18
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	it's also having a cascading effect on duration,  though, whereas deals were closing in, you know,	1098.66	5.94
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	two to three weeks and prior periods that we've  looked at, deals are now taking 467 weeks and	1104.6	7.02
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	even more. And so you see that reflected in the  numbers that we alluded to at the beginning,	1111.62	4.62
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	is that, you know, whereas this time last  year, there was almost 550 deals done,	1116.24	5.52
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	there was just about 240 deals done this time. And  so you're definitely seeing slower pace, you're	1121.76	8.04
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	seeing much more attention to the regulatory  frameworks into detail there. And that's all	1129.8	5.52
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	having a as you said me how a affect the valuation  schema. And so while we're going to assess that,	1135.32	4.525
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	we're going to try to get you guys out here and  try to get you smart in about 20 minutes or so why	1139.845	0.635
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	don't we take a look at some of the trends and  kind of the themes that we're seeing in terms of	1140.48	4.98
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	the sector and space? Where do we see some things  that are happening here that are very interesting,	1145.46	5.58
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	you all start off. And then me I would love to  hear kind of some of your thoughts on things	1151.04	4.02
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	like real world assets. One of the things that  we've been looking at are the exploration of	1155.06	6.3
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	NFTs on Bitcoin. This was brought to the world  around January of this year, Casey Rockmore,	1161.36	9.78
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	a very intelligent, brilliant developer, was able  to look at some of the innovations within Bitcoin	1171.14	7.56
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	that's happened over the last year, there's  been some improvements called taproot. And	1178.7	6.06
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	a few others out there that have given Bitcoin  the ability to do things similar to what we've	1184.76	6.3
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	seen with Ethereum and some of the other chains  out there. And so fast forward, you have now	1191.06	5.64
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	the entire theory book that Casey was able to  design. And with that, you're able to inscribe	1197.6	6.36
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	metadata. That could be a picture that could be  even something of like a scientific discovery,	1204.86	6.6
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	if you can even imagine that on to a Satoshi which  is obviously the smaller parts of Bitcoin. And so	1211.46	6.84
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	this is really interesting. We think that this is  got some legs to it. And we are definitely looking	1218.3	6.06
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	to see further build out in that space may have to Very exciting; I would say the other theme that	1224.36	6.54
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	that certainly is going to be a big, big part of  focus for for us going forward for the remainder	1230.9	5.58
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	of the year here, is certainly looking at real  world assets as a new source of that real yield	1236.48	6.84
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	that many, many have talked about very few have  have actually accomplished and started pushing	1243.32	6.66
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	onto the mass user base. What RWA is for short,  it stands for and are loosely defined, really, as	1250.52	7.86
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	tangible and financial assets, we've kind of the  potential to serve as that collateral that many	1258.38	6.12
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	of the DeFi primitives that we know and love can  use today. So some of those popular examples that	1264.5	5.94
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	often get put into that basket include anything  from credit notes, corporate debt, real estate, a	1270.44	6.96
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	stream of royalties and invoices, anything  that could become a linchpin, and already is a	1277.4	6.3
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	linchpin for your generation and the track five  world now slowly but surely migrating on-chain,	1284.9	6.3
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	posing his own set of challenges. But  nevertheless, one of the developments	1291.92	5.4
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	that we find extremely welcome, and particularly  exciting, this case that right now we have our	1297.32	5.58
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	eyes very firmly on is looking specifically  at the private debt, private debt patient,	1302.9	6.12
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	this is essentially non government debt issued  to the market. This is a rather small market	1309.02	6.9
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	when you're looking at the 100 plus trillion of  the world of financial assets, today representing	1316.52	5.94
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	about $1.4 trillion. But nevertheless, one area  where we are finding it early semblance of a	1322.46	6.54
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	product market fit, or what is able to happen for  many of the fintechs, as well as their emerging	1329.0	6.6
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	markets, credit note issuers, they are now able  to not only tokenize that particular instrument,	1335.6	5.88
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	but fine with a broader subset of potential  backers and investors, that is not captive to	1341.48	6.24
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	their given jurisdiction, whether it's Sub Saharan  Africa or Latin America, but now opens it up to a	1347.72	5.7
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	wider pool of investors here in the US, Europe,  and Asia, and the tooling still very early days.	1353.42	6.84
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	But the kind of work that's being done by projects  and founders and we're talking to these days,	1360.92	4.92
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	is extremely promising, and one that we  think we'll be able to unlock a brand new,	1365.84	6.12
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	lots of brand new, we always love to call it brand  new in this space, but essentially an asset class	1375.2	5.28
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	that is very well established as a good following,  and bring it to a non training environment where	1380.48	5.94
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	you can benefit from some of the primitives that  that on chain and public networks bring to bear.	1386.42	5.34
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	So very excited about about that as a trend. Agree, but there's also a lot more for us we'll	1391.76	4.98
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	be talking about there's other themes out  there, the NFT is the new internet cookie	1396.74	4.38
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	theory that's happening in the space. But  that's for another show. And hopefully you	1401.12	4.86
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	can join us again. So thank you all again,  this is connecting node. We'll be back	1405.98	3.96
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	to you real soon with more information,  more trends, more valuation information,	1409.94	3.78
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	try to get you a little bit more smart about  what's happening in the world of digital	1414.62	2.88
-VAMPxWf7bs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VAMPxWf7bs	assets from the venture perspective.  And we'll see you soon. Thank you.	1417.5	4.26
