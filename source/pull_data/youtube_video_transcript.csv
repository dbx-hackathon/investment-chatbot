rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	The biggest bank collapse	0.033	1.535
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	since the 2008 financial crisis.	1.568	2.302
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And it shut down today.	3.87	1.235
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	It's called the Silicon Valley Bank,	5.105	1.368
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and it is one of the tech industry's	6.473	1.535
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	largest lenders also lend to individuals	8.008	2.135
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	across the country.	10.176	0.835
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	It is now under control	11.011	1.134
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	of the federal government.	12.145	1.268
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	It was a sudden implosion	13.413	1.201
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and it came after a run on deposits.	14.614	2.236
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So the bank stock lost	17.25	1.168
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	80% of its value this week.	18.418	1.501
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	60% in one day alone.	19.919	1.869
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Yesterday, this morning, shares halted.	21.788	2.336
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	It was over quickly.	24.491	1.234
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And then police showed up	25.725	1.035
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	at the bank headquarters	26.76	0.8
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	in California today.	27.56	0.968
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	You're looking at that here	28.528	1.735
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Customers reportedly	30.263	1.235
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	even lined up at a bank	31.498	0.8
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	branch on Park Avenue in New York City.	32.298	2.136
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	The NYPD showed up there.	34.434	1.568
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Those customers	36.002	0.868
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	demanding their deposits back.	36.87	2.102
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Now to be clear,	38.972	1.001
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Silicon Valley	39.973	0.734
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Bank is a huge bank and its customers	40.707	1.835
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	include individuals as well as household	42.542	2.135
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	names, you may know, like Airbnb,	44.677	1.936
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Pinterest, Cisco.	46.613	1.635
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And this is a way bigger story.	48.248	2.135
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	The entire banking	50.617	0.867
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	industry is feeling the impact.	51.484	1.702
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	US banks at one	53.186	1.001
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	point had lost over	54.187	0.934
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	$100 billion in stock market value	55.121	2.336
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	in just two days.	57.457	1.134
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And there are fears	58.591	0.868
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	now that this could spread beyond banking	59.459	2.302
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	to other parts of the economy.	61.761	1.568
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	This is like the SNL	65.265	1.468
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	crisis in the eighties.	66.733	1.535
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We're not talking	68.268	0.567
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	about a failure of this bank,	68.835	1.235
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	but the banks could, you know, fail.	70.07	2.769
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Not all of this is clearly an example	72.839	2.803
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	of something breaking.	75.642	1.201
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We can assume that there are serious	76.843	1.602
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	contagion here.	78.445	1.901
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Okay.	80.847	0.4
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So when you use the word contagion,	81.247	1.368
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	it begs the question,	82.615	1.235
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	why could this happen at other banks?	83.85	2.069
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Well, for one basic reason,	85.919	1.434
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Silicon Valley Bank was doing	87.353	1.335
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	what a lot of other	88.688	0.868
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	banks are doing right now	89.556	1.668
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	slip to customer deposits.	91.224	2.002
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And they went	93.226	0.667
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and invested that money in other things	93.893	1.835
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	like U.S. government debt and mortgages.	95.728	2.103
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And they've been doing that	97.831	0.834
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	for quite a while.	98.665	1.134
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Well,	99.799	0.534
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	when the Fed started to hike rates	100.333	1.335
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	aggressively, that meant that Silicon	101.668	1.568
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Valley bank	103.236	0.534
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	immediately lost money	103.77	0.967
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	on those investments	104.737	1.168
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	at the very same time	105.905	1.135
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	as they were losing money	107.04	1.735
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	as interest rates rose.	108.775	1.201
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Those bank customers, those depositors,	109.976	2.002
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	they needed to withdraw more money.	111.978	1.735
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So they started to sell assets,	113.713	2.002
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	losing money	115.715	0.634
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	just to raise the money,	116.349	1.301
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	needed to make good on deposit	117.65	1.535
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	withdrawal requests.	119.185	1.268
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And then that turned	120.453	1.135
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	into a spiral of fear	121.588	1.067
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and a race among customers	122.655	1.068
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	to withdraw assets. The run on the bank.	123.723	2.069
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And yesterday afternoon,	126.359	0.968
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	the CEO of Silicon Valley Bank,	127.327	1.768
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	his name is Greg Becker,	129.095	1.402
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	hosted a call with clients	130.497	1.234
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and said, quote,	131.731	0.601
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	My ask is to stay calm	132.332	1.668
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	because that's what's important.	134.0	1.535
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We have been long term supporters of you.	135.535	2.102
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	The last thing we need you to do	137.637	1.435
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	is panic.	139.072	1.435
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Well, when that's the ask as a bank,	140.507	2.268
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	you're toast.	142.809	1.234
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And one person	144.043	0.768
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	familiar with the situation	144.811	1.201
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	asking me	146.012	0.434
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	the hypothetical question tonight	146.446	1.702
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	what prevents	148.148	0.667
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	runs on a whole bunch	148.815	0.901
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	more banks next week? Unclear.	149.716	2.335
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	It is an important moment.	152.585	1.168
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And tonight,	153.753	0.401
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	the deputy treasury secretary,	154.154	1.601
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Wally Adeyemo, is trying to calm fears.	155.755	2.269
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	In an exclusive interview with CNN,	158.024	1.602
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	federal	161.828	0.267
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	regulators are paying	162.095	1.368
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	attention to this	163.463	1.134
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	particular financial institution and that	164.597	2.403
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	when we think about the broader	167.267	1.301
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	financial system,	168.568	1.935
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	we're very confident in the ability	170.503	1.902
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and the resilience of the system.	172.405	2.936
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Alison Greenberg is OUTFRONT.	175.408	1.235
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	She is the CEO of Ruth Health.	176.643	1.468
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	It's a maternity care startup	178.111	1.435
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	that has money deposited in Silicon	179.546	1.935
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Valley Bank.	181.481	1.268
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So, Alison,	182.782	0.501
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	thank you very much for being with me.	183.283	1.368
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So you are right in the middle of this.	184.651	2.636
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Let's just start with.	187.287	1.434
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	When you realized you	188.721	1.602
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	a startup, you've got money at this bank.	190.323	2.069
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	You're using that money to make payroll	192.592	1.535
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and other things.	194.127	1.234
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	When did you find out	195.361	1.202
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	something was wrong?	196.563	1.601
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So my co-founder, Audrey Wu,	198.398	2.035
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and I received an email	200.433	1.335
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	from one of our seed investors.	201.768	2.602
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	The email seemed cryptic.	204.37	1.869
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	It was strange. It was urgent.	206.239	2.202
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	It was not like the other email he sends	209.042	2.135
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And we were in meetings.	211.544	2.403
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	You know, we run a busy	214.047	0.901
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	maternal health startup.	214.948	1.501
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We have so many concerns every day	216.449	2.002
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	that this email just didn't make sense.	218.451	2.536
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So a few hours later,	221.588	1.334
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I called the investor and I said, Hey,	222.922	1.602
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	what was this email about?	224.524	2.002
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	He was out of breath,	226.526	1.401
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	like he had just run a marathon.	227.927	1.802
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And he said, Take your money out of SBB,	229.729	2.903
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	go into your account,	232.632	1.134
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	take your money out as soon as possible.	233.766	2.236
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And, you know, as a business owner,	236.703	2.168
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	my co-founder,	239.505	0.768
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Adrian	240.273	0.267
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I constantly think about two things.	240.54	1.868
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We think about our team,	242.408	1.602
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	the people we employ and their families.	244.01	2.169
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And we think about our patients,	246.179	1.668
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	the mothers, the new moms	247.847	1.502
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and the families that we support	249.349	1.401
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and their families.	250.75	1.368
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And so for us, it was do this now	252.118	3.537
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	or else. Okay.	256.022	1.235
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And this was what, yesterday	257.257	1.267
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	or the day before?	258.524	1.068
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	This was yesterday	259.592	0.934
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	between the hours of noon and 3 p.m..	260.526	2.303
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Yesterday between the hours of noon	262.829	1.168
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and 3 p.m.	263.997	0.433
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	you get this.	264.43	0.401
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So then you do it. You go and you.	264.831	2.469
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And how does that happen?	267.467	1.401
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	They actually give you the money	268.868	1.068
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I mean, these are the 3 hours	269.936	1.134
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	before the world fell apart.	271.07	1.769
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So what happened then?	272.839	1.968
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Well,	274.807	0.201
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	we were incredibly lucky	275.008	1.234
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	to have that news early from an investor.	276.242	2.069
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We didn't withdraw the money immediately.	279.178	1.869
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	You know,	281.047	0.2
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	we're conscientious business owners.	281.247	1.535
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We spoke to a few other investors.	282.782	1.535
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We spoke to friends.	284.317	1.435
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I mean,	285.752	0.6
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	this is like calls going off the hook	286.352	1.535
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	for the last 36 hours.	287.887	2.035
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	When we felt confident	289.922	1.435
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	that this was going to be a crisis.	291.357	2.436
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Audrey acted fast.	293.793	1.668
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And this is the kind of fear	295.461	1.502
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	that actually incites focus.	296.963	1.335
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We withdrew the money	298.298	1.067
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	through transfers and wires	299.365	1.769
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	as soon as possible.	301.134	1.401
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I mean, she was withdrawing	302.535	1.201
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	small amounts,	303.736	0.734
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	big amounts	304.47	0.601
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	just to not set off an eye	305.071	1.501
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	that might limit our withdrawals.	306.572	2.069
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And we were able to remove	308.641	1.602
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	this was not our only bank account,	310.243	1.268
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	but we were able	311.511	0.567
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	to remove the majority of the funds	312.078	2.369
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	so that what was left	314.447	1.501
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	when the website crashed	315.948	1.969
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	was below the $250,000.	317.917	2.436
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Right. So you have money there.	320.553	1.335
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And I know the FDIC in terms of	321.888	2.202
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	because the amount	324.09	0.701
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I mean, obviously	324.791	0.467
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	had a lot more than that there.	325.258	0.901
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	You were able to get that out.	326.159	1.334
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	The amount that you have	327.493	0.901
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	that's insured now	328.394	0.768
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	by the FDIC, the 250,000.	329.162	1.968
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Your understanding	331.13	0.668
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	is you're going to get that	331.798	0.634
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	pretty much right away.	332.432	1.835
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	What we're hearing is by Monday. Okay.	334.267	1.935
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So that that	336.202	0.701
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I think that should give people calm.	336.903	1.101
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	The FDIC	338.004	0.701
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	if you're under the limit	338.705	1.301
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	it gives you	340.006	1.134
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	is a holding is holding strong on this.	341.14	2.069
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So Barron's is reporting	343.643	1.268
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	that the CEO Greg Becker	344.911	1.001
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I just mentioned him	345.912	0.7
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I know you weren't on that call,	346.612	1.035
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	but he had that call	347.647	1.635
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	that he sold nearly $3.6 million in stock	349.349	2.202
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	less than two weeks ago.	351.551	0.801
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	That's obviously worth zero tonight.	352.352	1.401
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I know you don't necessarily know	354.787	1.201
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	the circumstances of that.	355.988	1.268
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And I'm not trying to say	357.256	0.701
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	it was nefarious I'm just saying.	357.957	1.068
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	What's your reaction when you hear that?	359.025	2.703
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Erin, my reaction is	361.861	1.969
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	that this is so much bigger than a bank.	363.83	2.769
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I run a nationwide telehealth company.	367.166	3.571
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We serve,	370.737	0.667
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	you know, prenatal	371.404	0.767
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and postpartum patients.	372.171	1.602
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I have friends in health care, tech	373.773	1.768
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and financial tech and property tech,	375.541	2.403
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	all of us see the impact on human life.	377.944	2.736
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And so for us,	381.18	1.235
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	you know,	382.415	0.334
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	call with the CEO of the bank	382.749	1.701
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	is not our first priority.	384.45	1.769
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Our first priority is securing	386.219	1.468
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	those funds.	387.687	0.901
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And making sure we can meet	388.588	1.168
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	payroll on the 15th.	389.756	1.835
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	So, you know, the human impact of this,	391.591	2.803
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I think, is something	394.394	1.001
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I cannot underscore enough.	395.395	1.368
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And, you know,	396.763	1.001
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	my heart goes out to	397.764	0.8
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	so many business owners,	398.564	1.168
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	not just startups, but small business,	399.732	2.069
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	agriculture,	401.801	1.201
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	all the kinds of companies	403.002	1.135
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	that bank with us	404.137	1.101
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	where their founders	405.505	1.034
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	and owners are struggling right now,	406.539	2.102
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	trying to make ends meet,	408.841	1.335
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	trying to make sense of you fear.	410.176	1.568
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	And what you see is,	411.744	1.301
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I mean, we're	413.045	0.334
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	not even talking about other banks.	413.379	1.135
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We're talking about ASB itself,	414.514	1.534
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	but that the impacts	416.048	0.968
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	of this are significant	417.016	1.068
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	I mean, they will affect	419.218	1.135
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	everyday Americans.	420.353	1.068
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	They will not just affect CDOs like me.	421.421	2.135
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	We have team members in Arkansas,	423.556	1.835
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	North Carolina,	425.391	0.801
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	Washington State, Minnesota,	426.192	2.102
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	those people would be affected, too,	428.294	1.869
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	had we not gotten those	430.163	1.067
rlj2Y466wxg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj2Y466wxg	funds out in time.	431.23	0.834
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	if I ask you that how rich Anil Ambani	0.0	4.68

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	bankruptcy but interestingly if you	9.599	4.141
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	actually look at the type of Lifestyle	12.179	4.141

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	would be considered as a bankrupt person	16.32	4.2
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	similarly if you study about Donald	18.26	4.12
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Trump's wealth you will quickly figure	20.52	4.2
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	out that Mr Donald Trump has filed for	22.38	4.979
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	bankruptcy four times in his life then	24.72	3.84

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	estate then by what definition is he	31.92	4.139
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	bankrupt the point that I'm trying to	34.14	3.9
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	outline through these simple stories is	36.059	4.981
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that rich people despite bankruptcy they	38.04	4.859
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	are able to retain their wealth or many	41.04	3.48
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	of them are able to do that the prime	42.899	3.241
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	reason for that is that they actually	44.52	4.14
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	understand the law they also know how to	46.14	4.8
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	bend the rules without breaking them and	48.66	4.379
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	in the process they stay active they are	50.94	4.139
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	able to preserve that wealth this is	53.039	3.301
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	very different from the middle class	55.079	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	mindset that you and I usually have for	56.34	4.5
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	us we will always follow the rules we	58.98	3.419
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	will just go with the herd mentality	60.84	3.539
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	whatever new app is coming out we will	62.399	4.08
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	go and experiment with them so as a	64.379	3.661
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	result we get trapped into modern	66.479	3.421
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Financial traps that are built for us	68.04	4.74
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	like new apps which the rich people	69.9	5.28
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	benefit by trapping us so on this video	72.78	4.199
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	I am going to speak about these eight	75.18	4.08
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	very modern traps that are set for you	76.979	3.721
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	these could be things like you know what	79.26	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	getting 12 guaranteed returns investing	80.7	4.62
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	5000 rupees in a startup so that we can	83.04	4.2
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	also call ourselves as mini sharks what	85.32	4.2
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	not so all these are modern day traps if	87.24	3.72
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you avoid them you will definitely	89.52	3.48
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	become rich so Point number one is that	90.96	3.96
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	rich people understand the risk reward	93.0	3.9
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	curve but the middle class people or New	94.92	3.9
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Age investors really struggle to	96.9	3.899
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	understand this equation so let me help	98.82	3.659
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you understand this point by using a	100.799	3.301
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	couple of examples but first and	102.479	3.661
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	foremost to understand what risk reward	104.1	3.479
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	curve means take a look at this	106.14	3.839
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	particular graph so for example here if	107.579	4.68
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you are investing in fixed deposits that	109.979	4.14
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	is what that is a low risk investment	112.259	3.841
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	and the return is also low so it's a low	114.119	4.081
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	risk low reward equation on the flip	116.1	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	side if you go and invest in cryptos	118.2	3.3
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that's completely other end of the	119.88	3.66
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	spectrum so here the risk is also very	121.5	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	high and the reward is also very high so	123.54	3.359
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	when rich people invest they understand	125.34	3.0
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that they are putting their money	126.899	3.301
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	somewhere along this curve they can take	128.34	3.539
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	high risk they can take low risk they	130.2	3.899
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	usually balance out their portfolio so	131.879	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that is the perspective with which they	134.099	4.261
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	invest on the flip side the normal	135.78	4.56
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	retail investors or normal common	138.36	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	investors or new investors who are	140.34	3.6
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	getting into the market who want to grow	142.2	3.6
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	their wealth they Keep On Believing in	143.94	3.54
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	like pointless arguments like you know	145.8	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	what if I give my money to some app it	147.48	5.339
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	will grow it at 12 13 14 Club does that	149.64	5.099
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	so I'm not naming the app directly but	152.819	3.481
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you know which apps I'm speaking about	154.739	3.601
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	so they commit to the fact that you know	156.3	3.659
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	what if you give us money we will be	158.34	4.08
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	giving you 12 return guaranteed okay it	159.959	4.201
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	sounds great in theory but the problem	162.42	3.72
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	is that just understand again that	164.16	3.9
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	equation from risk reward perspective	166.14	4.44
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	usually these type of apps weave these	168.06	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Rosy dreams said you know what if you	170.58	3.06
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	give us your money we will grow it at 12	171.9	3.9
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	okay great you have talked about the	173.64	3.959
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	first half of the equation but you have	175.8	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	forgotten to mention the risk part of	177.599	4.381
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	the curve so this is something that a	179.58	4.439
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	normal retail investors or normal New	181.98	4.14
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Age investors fail to understand and	184.019	3.661
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	they are not able to grow their wealth	186.12	3.3
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	on the flip side Rich investors like	187.68	3.779
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Robert Kiyosaki Warren Buffett they	189.42	3.959
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	understand this point and they balance	191.459	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	their portfolio accordingly I have	193.379	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	received so many questions queries that	195.36	2.94
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you know what actually can you please	197.28	3.06
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	talk about this particular app it is	198.3	4.68
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	promising to give 12 return should I	200.34	4.38
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	invest all my money in it you should	202.98	3.479
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	definitely not invest all your money in	204.72	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	it why for the simple point that the	206.459	4.321
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	risk associated with such investment is	208.5	4.68
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	also going to be fairly high so I hope	210.78	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you get this point let's move on to the	213.18	2.88
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	second point now when it comes to rich	214.62	3.96
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	people they mostly live on rent in early	216.06	4.92
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	part of their life rather than owning	218.58	4.2
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	stuff now what do I mean by that let me	220.98	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	give you a practical example so I live	222.78	3.48
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	in South Goa and it is one of the	224.76	3.66
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	poshest society that I'm living in it	226.26	4.44
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	has a bunch of Villas and I get to speak	228.42	4.14
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	with my neighbors quite frequently and	230.7	3.36
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	I've learned that majority of the people	232.56	3.66
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	living in this neighborhood they own	234.06	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	their businesses at least most of them	236.22	3.9
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	and they are living on rent this is	237.9	3.419
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	something that you might have also	240.12	3.119
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	noticed with people in the business	241.319	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	community that typically the business	243.239	3.72
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Community people what they simply do is	245.159	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that rather than buying a house in the	246.959	4.021
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	early part of their life they will put	249.06	4.08
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that money where into their business for	250.98	3.959
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	example creating a factory buying a land	253.14	4.02
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	or using that money to generate some	254.939	3.781
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	kind of cash flow they will not stick	257.16	3.299
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that money in terms of buying a house	258.72	3.54
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	now what do middle class people do now	260.459	3.18
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	I'm not trying to criticize the middle	262.26	2.999
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	class I'm just telling you the Practical	263.639	3.481
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	reality so that you can pick up these	265.259	3.961
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	type of points so typically middle class	267.12	3.9
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	people what they would do is that Jesse	269.22	4.199
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	as soon as I get a job I will start an	271.02	4.739
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Emi on my home loan so that is called as	273.419	4.56
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	buying things to early in life now I am	275.759	3.541
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	not against buying a house if you're	277.979	2.94
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	getting a good deal definitely buy a	279.3	3.119
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	house you should have a house at some	280.919	4.621
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	stage in your life I'm not against it at	282.419	4.681
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	all but the timing of that buying	285.54	3.12
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	decision needs to be really thought	287.1	3.06
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	through so again I'll give you second	288.66	3.539
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	example of Mr Mark Cuban who is one of	290.16	3.96

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you buy the third thing that rich people	304.68	3.54
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	do really really well is that they know	306.36	4.2

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	downside so let me explain this by some	311.639	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	of the FAQs or frequently asked	313.86	3.899

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	simply push you to investigate the worst	337.8	3.72
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	case scenario here that if you are	340.02	3.06

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	are fairly good at this now one of the	385.44	3.66
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Prime reasons why they are good at this	387.479	4.081
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	is that a they create multiple types of	389.1	4.319
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	incomes for example they have active	391.56	3.66
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	income they have passive income they	393.419	3.78

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	network which they can leverage they	397.199	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	start building Brands so they do a bunch	398.819	3.781
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	of different things I'll not believe at	400.979	2.881
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	this point because there is a separate	402.6	2.7
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	video that I have done on this topic	403.86	3.48

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	to learn more about it but to cut the	407.34	3.6
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	long story short rich people what they	409.08	4.02
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	do is they create a portfolio of	410.94	4.02
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	different incomes a portfolio of	413.1	3.96
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	different assets that kind of protects	414.96	3.54
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	their downside risk now comes the	417.06	3.3
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	natural question that how can I protect	418.5	3.539
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	my downside risk now one of the foremost	420.36	3.3
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	things that you can do there is that	422.039	3.72
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	please have insurance do not experiment	423.66	4.5
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	with the fact you know what but because	425.759	4.681
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	this puts you and your family at greater	428.16	4.08
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	risk and it is very very important to	430.44	3.66
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	hedge your downside risk now many of you	432.24	3.6
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	would say that okay in the latest budget	434.1	3.539
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	it was announced that in the new tax	435.84	3.96
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	regime the incentives to buy insurance	437.639	4.261
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	would be withdrawn now again please ask	439.8	4.2
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	a natural question that why is it that	441.9	4.019
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you need insurance is it to grow your	444.0	3.419
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	money the answer is no many insurance	445.919	3.241
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	companies sell insurance that way but	447.419	3.241
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that is not the objective of insurance	449.16	4.14
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	is it to get like tax benefits only then	450.66	4.62
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you will buy insurance again that is not	453.3	4.08
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	the right answer the only reason why you	455.28	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	need to have insurance is fairly simple	457.38	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	to protect the downside and to buy	459.06	4.02

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Insurance the fourth thing that rich	473.819	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	people do is that they actually own real	475.38	4.14
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Assets Now you say all assets are real	477.599	3.181
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	what is the difference between real	479.52	3.119
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	asset and fake asset so let me give you	480.78	4.259
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	two examples there the first example is	482.639	5.46
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	of REITs versus Real Estate now think	485.039	4.741
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	about it this way that have you ever	488.099	3.481
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	read in the newspaper that Donald Trump	489.78	3.359
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	purchased five million dollars worth of	491.58	3.6
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	REITs no you would have read that he	493.139	3.481
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	actually purchased physical real estate	495.18	3.959
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	in India if you go again have you ever	496.62	4.139
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	read that this Rich builder for example	499.139	4.441
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	hirana nanis they invested in reads now	500.759	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	again you will read that okay	503.58	3.119
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	hiranandani's purchased this crore of	504.66	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	real estate now what is the point that	506.699	3.361
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	I'm trying to drive home the point is	508.5	3.719
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that these days in finance a lot of	510.06	4.2
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	things are packaged in a certain way for	512.219	3.481
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	example you will be given the assurance	514.26	3.42
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that okay if you are investing in REITs	515.7	3.779
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you can do it with only 5000 rupees	517.68	3.659
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	what's the big harm just go and invest	519.479	3.721
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	five thousand rupees you'll become Malik	521.339	4.381
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	of some house no that is not correct in	523.2	4.62
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	REITs what ends up happening is that you	525.72	3.96
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	end up owning the shares in a particular	527.82	4.199
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	company now theoretically now again this	529.68	3.96
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	is a highly debatable point I have made	532.019	3.301
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	a separate video on reads please go and	533.64	3.42
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	watch it but just to contextualize	535.32	3.54
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	things if you are owning let's say five	537.06	3.24
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	shares in a party particular REITs	538.86	3.24
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	company what are you actually owning	540.3	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you're owning some kind of a paper asset	542.1	4.02
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	on the flip side if you are owning five	544.08	3.9
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	shares of Hindustan Unilever again what	546.12	3.3
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	are you owning you are owning a	547.98	3.0
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	fractional ownership in a particular	549.42	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	company now think about it this way that	550.98	4.26
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	reads what is the underlying here the	553.26	4.32
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	underlying is the real estate why do you	555.24	4.5
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	buy real estate it is very simple to	557.58	4.199
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	gain control over a particular property	559.74	3.96
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	so to say so that you can rent it out	561.779	3.841
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that decision is yours you can do a	563.7	3.48
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	bunch of stuff on it but when you're	565.62	3.899
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	buying in reads you get absolutely zero	567.18	4.08
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	control so this is the biggest problem	569.519	3.721
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	in terms of buying read personally I	571.26	3.9
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	will prefer investing my money in good	573.24	4.02
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	companies like hindustanian liver HDFC	575.16	4.32
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Bank Etc because the underlying growth	577.26	3.72
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	of these business is much higher	579.48	3.24
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	compared to the real estate growth to	580.98	3.479
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	begin with and also when you are buying	582.72	3.48
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	REITs you are again getting paper assets	584.459	4.021
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	and absolutely zero control now you'll	586.2	3.8
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	say that okay fine	588.48	4.74
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	but what about gold because I find it	590.0	4.779
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	very difficult to buy physical gold	593.22	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	store physical gold all this jig Jake is	594.779	4.201
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	there so does it make sense for me to go	597.06	3.36
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	and buy some something like Sovereign	598.98	3.359
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Gold Bond so again have you ever read	600.42	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that Robert Kiyosaki invested in	602.339	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Sovereign Gold Bond or some variant of	604.2	4.079
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	it the answer is no he actually buys	606.24	4.32
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	physical gold any rich person who	608.279	4.201
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	believes in the gold story they end up	610.56	4.14
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	procuring physical gold is there Jamila	612.48	4.44
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	associated with it absolutely yes there	614.7	4.02
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	are jamilas associated in terms of	616.92	4.62
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	procuring gold storing it etc etc but to	618.72	4.92
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	cut the long story short it serves a	621.54	4.799
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	specific purpose people buy gold as a	623.64	4.5
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	hedge for risk now what is the meaning	626.339	3.781
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	of Hedge for risk for example if there	628.14	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	is some kind of government default or if	630.12	3.839
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	there is increased risk or if there are	631.98	4.38
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Wars breaking out between countries then	633.959	4.201
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	in such a situation gold becomes a good	636.36	3.539
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	asset but what type of gold sovereign	638.16	3.48
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	gold one the answer is no it is the	639.899	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	physical gold that gains value in the	641.64	3.96
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	event a particular government defaults	643.8	2.94
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	I'm not talking about the Indian	645.6	3.06
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	government here but generally if a	646.74	3.96
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	particular government defaults then any	648.66	4.44
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	type of bond including the Gold Bond its	650.7	4.379
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	value will go to absolute zero so rich	653.1	4.02
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	people what they actually own is real	655.079	4.021
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	assets not fake assets rich people know	657.12	4.32
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	where their money is actually going but	659.1	4.14
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	majority of the new investors or middle	661.44	4.44
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	class are unaware of this fact so let me	663.24	4.56
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	give you some examples and back it up	665.88	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	with some logic and facts here for	667.8	3.539
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	example many of the rich people they	669.66	4.08
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	invest via hedge funds now hedge funds	671.339	4.62
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	are what so hedge funds are managed by	673.74	3.839
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	these big big people like you know Bill	675.959	4.141
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Ackman and Mr Ray dalio so they run	677.579	4.38
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	their own hedge funds and these people	680.1	4.2
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	manage other rich people's money now the	681.959	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	rich people actually somewhat closely	684.3	3.42
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	monitor the performance of hedge funds	685.86	3.9
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	the hedge funds tells them they have	687.72	3.48
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	frequent calls with these rich people	689.76	3.3
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	they explain them why they are investing	691.2	4.92
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	in certain assets versus not etc etc so	693.06	5.519
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	for example let's say that if money is	696.12	4.62
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	giving his money to Bill Ackman to	698.579	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	manage then he will keep a very close	700.74	4.2
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	eye on him and Mr Bill Ackman is going	702.48	4.979
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	to explain categorically where Mr Mukesh	704.94	4.74
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Ambani money is being invested but on	707.459	3.721
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	the flip side when it comes to average	709.68	3.779
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	investors and New Age investors what	711.18	4.56
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	ends up happening majority of us even if	713.459	3.961
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	we are investing our money in equities	715.74	3.9
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	or other form of asset classes what what	717.42	4.08
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	do we do we typically give it to mutual	719.64	3.6
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	fund managers now do we have a sense	721.5	3.72
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	where our money is going in mutual funds	723.24	4.56
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	for most of us the answer is no on top	725.22	4.32
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	of that these days you might have seen	727.8	3.779
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	apps what are they doing they are saying	729.54	3.479
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that you're not we will automate the	731.579	3.241
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Investments for you all you have to do	733.019	4.081
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	is that you know shopping page we will	734.82	4.199
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	round it off 200 rupees and five rupees	737.1	3.419
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	will go to some asset you'll say that	739.019	4.981
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	okay right automatic investment but the	740.519	4.981
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	problem there is that there are two	744.0	3.48
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	layers of commissions now how to layers	745.5	4.32
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	one is that's it these apps or New Age	747.48	4.02
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	apps are not doing some kind of dandharm	749.82	2.699
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	right they are going to take some	751.5	2.94
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	commissions from you second if they are	752.519	3.481
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	rounding off and giving money to some	754.44	3.42
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	user fund manager to invest on your	756.0	3.42
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	behalf then there is second layer of	757.86	2.94
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	permission now you'll say that okay	759.42	3.18
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	thought about commission yeah little bit	760.8	3.36
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	commission here and there so what's the	762.6	3.239
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	big deal it's not as if that that is the	764.16	3.0
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	end of the world if I'm paying one	765.839	3.661
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	percent commission extra what's that big	767.16	3.72
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	deal now the problem with one percent	769.5	3.0
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	commission can be understood through	770.88	3.66
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	this simple example so let's say that	772.5	3.3
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you are putting one lakh rupee in the	774.54	2.52
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	stock market and you are able to	775.8	3.06
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	generate 10 return so what does that	777.06	4.68
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	become and it becomes 1.1 lakhs now if	778.86	4.32
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you are paying one percent additional	781.74	3.659
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	then how much profit percentage you are	783.18	3.779
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	paying so the answer comes out to be	785.399	3.661
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	roughly 10 how you do the math and tell	786.959	3.601
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	me in the comment box but that is the	789.06	3.24
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	analysis that I'll leave you with So	790.56	4.079
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	when you say one percent of my AUM is	792.3	4.26
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	being paid in commissions you need to	794.639	3.421
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	acknowledge the fact that that one	796.56	4.079
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	percent AUM or asset under management is	798.06	4.5
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	equivalent to almost 10 percent of your	800.639	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	profit sometime so be very very	802.56	3.959
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	cognizant about where your money is	804.54	3.479
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	going how much commissions you are	806.519	3.601
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	paying so all these rich people know	808.019	4.32
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	this game and us new normal investors	810.12	4.019
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Keep On Believing in this automation	812.339	3.541
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	stuff now rich people do not take	814.139	4.44
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Consumer loans they take business loans	815.88	5.1
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	and on their business they take further	818.579	3.781
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Consumer loans now how does this	820.98	2.94
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	mechanism play out let me use some	822.36	3.419
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	examples to illustrate the power of this	823.92	3.659
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	point so again coming back to the	825.779	3.781
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	example where we started the story of Mr	827.579	4.741
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Anil Amani so Anil Ambani went bankrupt	829.56	4.86
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	but his personal wealth or a large part	832.32	4.319
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	of his personal wealth is intact how is	834.42	4.14
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that possible okay so in India we have a	836.639	3.901
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	concept called as LLC or limited	838.56	4.019
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	liability company or limited liability	840.54	4.08
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	company or limited liability partnership	842.579	4.801
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	now what does limited liability means it	844.62	4.26
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	simply means that there is a bifurcation	847.38	4.32
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	between individuals wealth and their	848.88	4.56
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	company's wealth for example if I am	851.7	3.12
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	creating a company called as wisdom	853.44	2.82
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	hatch and you can go and check out our	854.82	3.48
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	company also we run wonderful courses to	856.26	4.319
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	help you understand investment better we	858.3	4.14
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	have a wonderful community that is built	860.579	3.421
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	around it and people discuss with each	862.44	3.18
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	other to improve their investment	864.0	3.36
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	argument so imagine that I'm running	865.62	3.36
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	this company and I take out a business	867.36	3.719
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	loan on it for example let's say five	868.98	4.38
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	crore rupees now if for some reason the	871.079	4.44
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	companies goes bankrupt it will not hurt	873.36	4.2
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	me personally so let's imagine that my	875.519	4.021
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	personal worth is 10 crore rupee I've	877.56	3.839
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	kept that into my bank account but I	879.54	4.14
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	have taken a five crore rupee loan on my	881.399	4.261
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	business which is business match if the	883.68	4.019
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	company goes under what happened in Mr	885.66	4.44
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Anil Amani's case that company is gone	887.699	4.08
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	there is no money that is coming out of	890.1	3.66
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	it but my personal wealth stays intact	891.779	3.721
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	of course it is more complicated than	893.76	3.3
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	this but I hope you understood the	895.5	3.18
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	difference between taking business loan	897.06	3.719
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	and personal loans so majority of the	898.68	3.659
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	rich people what they do is that they	900.779	3.661
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	create their own companies take loans on	902.339	4.021
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	it and on these companies they take	904.44	3.72
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	further loans to buy more Assets Now	906.36	3.659
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	this will go into a conspiracy rent so	908.16	3.239
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	I'll come back to the topic so the	910.019	3.18
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	lesson that we need to draw out why are	911.399	3.721
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	the story is fairly simple that you and	913.199	4.021
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	I should at least avoid taking a lot of	915.12	4.38
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	personal loans because one day it might	917.22	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	happen that we might want to start our	919.5	4.019
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	own business we might want to take loans	921.06	4.38
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	for productive purposes so then our	923.519	4.081
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	credit score and credit uptake might get	925.44	4.259
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	hit so please be very very cognizant	927.6	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	about the things for which you are	929.699	3.421
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	taking loan on so rich people understand	931.38	3.84
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	in what things they are investing their	933.12	3.899
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	money in now what do I mean by that let	935.22	3.6
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	me give you an example so these days	937.019	3.18
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	there is a pressure line that is going	938.82	3.3
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	on that you know what shark tank culture	940.199	4.32
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	is there and normal retail investors can	942.12	4.98
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	also invest in startups while startup	944.519	4.021
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	investing might require a lot of money	947.1	3.239
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	but you can become an angel investor	948.54	4.44
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	just invest like 3000 rupees 5000 rupees	950.339	4.081
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	and you can call yourself as Angel	952.98	3.9

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	why am I saying no because any startup	961.199	3.781
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	that you are investing in do you get to	963.3	3.96

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	liquidating it becomes very very	1003.019	3.361
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	difficult what is the meaning of	1004.94	3.24
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	liquidation it simply means that for	1006.38	4.079
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	example tomorrow you go and buy HDFC	1008.18	4.44

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	money is likely to get stuck it will be	1024.86	3.54
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	very difficult for you to liquidate	1026.839	3.84

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	fund investing with the intent that they	1037.16	4.86

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	they are getting so they spread their	1042.02	3.36
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	little little money across different set	1043.699	3.841

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	accordingly this is something that we	1047.54	3.3
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	should all understand that be very very	1049.22	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	cognizant wherever your money is going	1050.84	4.44
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	and understand the pros and cons of the	1053.0	3.66
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	asset class that you are choosing to	1055.28	3.42
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	invest your money in rich people have	1056.66	4.8
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	portfolio of incomes not portfolio of	1058.7	4.56
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	money saving strategies now what do I	1061.46	3.24
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	mean by that let me contextualize by	1063.26	3.36
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	giving a few examples so for example	1064.7	3.66
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	Point number one here is that it is	1066.62	4.32
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	easier to make money than to save money	1068.36	4.559
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	why am I saying it because the rate at	1070.94	3.54
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	which the manga is going up just check	1072.919	3.541
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	the rate at which you eat restaurant	1074.48	4.02
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	food three years ago if you were getting	1076.46	4.74
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	a bill of 400 500 rupees now at the same	1078.5	4.559
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	restaurant the per head will might come	1081.2	3.78
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	out to be 800 900 rupees so the	1083.059	3.781
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	inflation or the price rise in the	1084.98	3.96
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	economy is just going up at a wacky pace	1086.84	4.44
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	so according to me there is hardly any	1088.94	4.26
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	major benefit in terms of figuring out	1091.28	3.779
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	five strategies on how to get like more	1093.2	3.719
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	cashback or which credit card should I	1095.059	3.36
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	use today in order to save like 25	1096.919	3.241
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	rupees more now I'm not saying that	1098.419	3.361
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	these things are completely useless they	1100.16	3.48
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	might be okay every once in a while if	1101.78	3.6
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	you're doing it it's fine if there is	1103.64	3.12
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	some system that you have built it is	1105.38	3.539
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	completely cool but your energy should	1106.76	4.2
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	be focused in terms of developing or	1108.919	4.801
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	cultivating your wide majority of entire	1110.96	5.099
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	portfolio income now on an average every	1113.72	4.62

IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	so your mental energy and thought	1118.34	3.42
IMCoGAtj_dY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMCoGAtj_dY	process should go where it should go	1120.14	3.6

ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	well the problem is as you know for	48.0	3.96
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	years it kept dropping interest rates	50.28	4.02
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and now Powell's raising it the real	51.96	4.86
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	problem is the bond Market's crashing	54.3	5.099
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and the bond market is systemic as you	56.82	4.379
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	know I mean I'm concerned about IRAs	59.399	6.061
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	pension plans and all that so uh this is	61.199	7.261
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	more than it's amazing I'm concerned	65.46	4.08
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	should I say	68.46	2.519
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and then you know thank you for all	69.54	2.759
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	these years letting me come on your	70.979	3.921
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	program and say buy silver buy gold	72.299	6.061
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	because when I first started coming on I	74.9	6.28
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	think this was three dollars and	78.36	5.52
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	this was fifty dollars and now it's two	81.18	4.979
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	thousand and didn't get any bigger Neil	83.88	4.26
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	still you know no it did not get any	86.159	3.481
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	bigger but but you know what's	88.14	3.36
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	interesting today Robert if you look at	89.64	3.54
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	it might be just a sort of a	91.5	5.04
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	coincidental blip all arising bond price	93.18	5.82
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	is rising yields collapsing uh you know	96.54	4.2
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	a 10-year note for example that was over	99.0	4.619
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	four percent last week is around 3.45	100.74	5.699
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	percent today when I last look so Bond's	103.619	5.101
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	doing well you know stocks holding up	106.439	4.68
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	fairly well uh Bank stocks off their	108.72	5.039
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	lows Metal's doing just fine	111.119	4.68
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	um that can't continue indefinitely so	113.759	4.921
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	what wins out	115.799	5.341
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	now the thing that I see is that the fed	118.68	4.56
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and the FDIC are signaling	121.14	4.86
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	hyperinflation which makes gold and	123.24	5.579
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	silver even better because this thing	126.0	4.739
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	here is trash they're going to create	128.819	4.56
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	more and more of this fake money and	130.739	4.801
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	that's what the fed and the FDIC is	133.379	4.44
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	signaling we're going to print as much	135.54	4.8
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	of this as possible to keep the crash	137.819	4.801
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	from accelerating but they're the	140.34	5.039
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	they're the guys who are causing it	142.62	4.32
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	so in other words with the Federal	145.379	3.661
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	Reserve now saying but essentially we're	146.94	3.72
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	going to be a backstop to say nothing of	149.04	3.48
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	the U.S government for all these	150.66	3.9
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	institutions in trouble now guaranteeing	152.52	4.439
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	deposits for those with way more than	154.56	5.28
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	250 thousand dollars at a bank three	156.959	5.341
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	different banks right now you think that	159.84	5.759
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	will be inflationary and you think uh	162.3	5.34
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	the pause that some are expecting on the	165.599	4.741
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	part of the Federal Reserve on raising	167.64	6.3
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	rates will only exacerbate this	170.34	6.0
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	well they have to bail out now which is	173.94	4.439
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	not quite legal anymore	176.34	4.32
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	but as I said they're going to print	178.379	4.621
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	more and more of this stuff	180.66	5.46
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and it makes this stuff	183.0	5.099
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	gold and I think this is the best	186.12	4.5
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	investment of all is silver because	188.099	6.901
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	every Tomahawk missile has 30 pounds of	190.62	6.479
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	silver in it every time they push that	195.0	4.44
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	missile button 30 pounds of silver	197.099	4.021
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	disappears	199.44	4.62
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	so we're in we're in serious trouble	201.12	6.6
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and the fed and the FDIC signaling we're	204.06	5.819
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	going to do whatever it takes and that	207.72	5.78
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	means print more of this stuff here	209.879	3.621
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	stepping back from what you like about	213.62	4.839
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	metals and and putting your money in a	216.54	4.08
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	place that can sort of counter what	218.459	4.14
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	we're seeing what are you seeing in	220.62	3.66
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	terms of inflation now the federal	222.599	4.741
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	reserve's been busy now a year ago what	224.28	4.5
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	Friday when they started raising	227.34	3.84
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	interest rates going from zero to close	228.78	4.679
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	to five percent where we are now on the	231.18	4.139
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	federal funds the overnight Bank lending	233.459	3.36
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	rate	235.319	3.901
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	um do you see that paused indefinitely	236.819	4.621
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	do you see any possibility they reverse	239.22	5.4
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	action or what happens now I mean taking	241.44	5.64
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	a look at the whole you know the whole	244.62	4.14
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	kettle	247.08	4.14
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	well let me say it again the problem is	248.76	4.259
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	the bond market	251.22	4.14
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and my prediction you know I called	253.019	4.801
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	Lehman Brothers years ago	255.36	5.04
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and I think the next Bank to go is	257.82	3.96
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	Credit Suisse	260.4	4.019
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and if that happens if Japan because of	261.78	4.859
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	it because of its exposure to a lot of	264.419	3.361
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	this	266.639	4.141
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	yes because the bond market is crashing	267.78	4.38
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	you know all those bonds let's say	270.78	2.88
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	you're getting getting paid five percent	272.16	3.36
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	for a bond and it goes to ten percent	273.66	5.58
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	the five percent Bond crashes and the	275.52	5.34
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	bond market is much bigger than the	279.24	3.12
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	stock market As We Know	280.86	4.14
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	so fabulous	282.36	4.38
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and they're the what they say the	285.0	4.86

ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	on it saying Silicon Valley Bank they	294.24	3.899
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	could talk about poor manage and I know	296.82	3.42
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	a lot has been said about that but more	298.139	4.62
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	than half their overall portfolio was in	300.24	4.739

ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	unknowing investors so they were doing	312.3	4.44
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	something that seems on paper to have	314.759	3.601
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	been the right thing the conservative	316.74	4.32
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	thing the irony was that they were	318.36	4.559
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	buying a lot of this when rates are at	321.06	4.02
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	zero prices were a lot higher for	322.919	4.201
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	treasury notes and bonds and when they	325.08	3.72
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	had to unload some money they were under	327.12	5.16
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	water so you can't win uh in that	328.8	5.399
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	environment	332.28	4.08
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	no and that's why I said the biggest	334.199	3.661
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	problem is you know is the bond market	336.36	3.66
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	which is the biggest Market in the world	337.86	5.16

ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and they hate us and they might switch	351.36	5.16
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	to the Chinese gold Yuan	354.12	5.04
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	so we're in Syria's trouble US dollar is	356.52	5.76
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	losing its hegemony in the world right	359.16	4.319
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	now so	362.28	3.78
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and they're going to print more and more	363.479	4.621
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and more of this trying to keep this	366.06	4.8
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	thing from sinking so that's why but	368.1	4.08
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	they've been doing that but that's been	370.86	3.3
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	going on for years right Robert I mean	372.18	4.44
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	we have these huge days like this and	374.16	4.319
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	you're quite right to note it's a it's a	376.62	4.26
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	clear phenomenon today but we've had	378.479	4.681
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	these punctuating our history over the	380.88	4.98
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	last 20 plus years what makes this go	383.16	5.039
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	around different	385.86	5.88
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	because her death to GDP is over 130 and	388.199	4.801
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	every time they raise those interest	391.74	2.239
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	rates	393.0	5.4
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	America's taxpayer gets hammered and uh	393.979	6.581
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	my concern is the pensions are in	398.4	3.6
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	trouble because they're loaded with	400.56	4.62
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	bonds also and my generation the Boomers	402.0	5.819
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	was trying to retire so this is the work	405.18	5.4
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	in the perfect storm in many ways	407.819	5.461
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	so I like I said again as I think the	410.58	5.58
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	fed and the FDIC signaled they're going	413.28	5.58
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	to print again which makes stocks good	416.16	5.34
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	but this little silver coin here is	418.86	5.94
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	still the best it's 35 bucks you know so	421.5	6.539
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	I I reckon anybody can afford 35 and I'm	424.8	5.88
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	concerned about Credit Suisse	428.039	4.621
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	interesting I have heard that before if	430.68	4.139
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	you've got a big big bank that has this	432.66	3.84
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	exposure and credit Suite does have a	434.819	3.361
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	lot of conservative treasuries on its	436.5	3.9
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	portfolio that has been raised the bank	438.18	4.2
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	said it is well financed well secured	440.4	3.419
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	and all of that but we'll watch it	442.38	3.3
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	closely Robert always good seeing you	443.819	3.72
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	even with a forecast like that Robert	445.68	4.5
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	Kiyosaki the Rich Dad Poor Dad our	447.539	4.321
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	best-selling authors turned that into a	450.18	3.12
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	cottage industry he's been at a lot of	451.86	3.36
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	these phenomenon remember he saw Lehman	453.3	4.019
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	Brothers coming long before anyone else	455.22	4.5
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	in the last meltdown let's pray this	457.319	4.021
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	time what he's seeing doesn't help it	459.72	4.5
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	with this potential meltdown we shall	461.34	5.16
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	watch it closely all right I hope you	464.22	4.319
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	are and I love your forecast and all	466.5	4.02
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	everything else Robert but man that's a	468.539	5.121
ObhZBJrhHzs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhZBJrhHzs	scary scenario for the whole world	470.52	3.14
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	the second key point is that you must	1.7	4.98
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	invest like rich	3.899	2.781
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	hi everyone welcome to today's video so	7.259	4.321
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	recently you might have watched the news	9.66	3.479
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	or read the news that there is a very	11.58	4.019
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	famous Indian Bollywood actress and she	13.139	4.801
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	bought a house back in 2015 for 31	15.599	4.741
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	crores and recently she sold that house	17.94	4.44
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	for 32 crores so people are making fun	20.34	5.04
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	of her prison kind of dumb investment is	22.38	4.86
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	this but let me tell you that she is a	25.38	3.659
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	real estate genius why am I saying it	27.24	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	now I am not telling you the name of the	29.039	3.36
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	actress otherwise I'll get personally	30.84	3.36
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	sued so back to the story so this is	32.399	3.361
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	what happens in real estate that there	34.2	3.3
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	is a lot of black money involved and	35.76	3.299
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	rich people know how to play this game	37.5	3.239
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	so basically what would have happened in	39.059	3.421
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	this story was that the person would not	40.739	4.32
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	have sold this house for 32 crores she	42.48	4.259
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	would have sold this out for 50 crores	45.059	4.081
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	now 32 is the wide money component that	46.739	4.681
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	is there on paper rest 18 crores is	49.14	4.5
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	black money component now zero taxes	51.42	4.02
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	paid on the black money component and	53.64	3.96
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	even on that 32 crores now because she	55.44	3.779
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	has bought that house for 31 crores	57.6	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	there is a gain of one crore even on	59.219	3.901
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	that one crore no tax would have been	61.32	3.659
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	paid why is that because this is called	63.12	4.08
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	as indexation benefits now what is index	64.979	4.561
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	and benefit well let's pick the example	67.2	4.2
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	of this property and compare it with	69.54	3.18
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	real estate and then I will tell you	71.4	3.24
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	that how middle class gets messed up but	72.72	3.48
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	rich people benefit from these type of	74.64	3.18
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	indexation rules so in index session	76.2	3.419
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	what happens is that if you purchased a	77.82	3.299
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	property let's say today at one crore	79.619	3.241
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	rupee then let's say in two years you	81.119	3.721
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	sell that property for 1.5 crores so	82.86	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	what is your profit your profit is 50	84.84	3.419
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	lakhs so ideally you should be paying a	86.46	4.44
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	wealth gain tax on that 50 lakh but what	88.259	4.621
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	happens due to indexation is that people	90.9	3.539
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	say that you're not because of inflation	92.88	3.419
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	the property price would have also gone	94.439	3.781
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	up so the government revises the circle	96.299	4.261
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	rate and instead of paying tax on that	98.22	4.8
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	50 lakh appreciation you would only end	100.56	4.379
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	up paying taxes on maybe like 35 40	103.02	3.48
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	lakhs whatever the government decides	104.939	3.661
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	now guess where middle class Parks their	106.5	3.84
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	money they would mostly Park their money	108.6	3.24
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	in fixed deposit where they are not	110.34	3.36
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	getting any indexation benefits where do	111.84	3.3
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	you think rich people Park their money	113.7	3.48
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	they buy this type of real estate and	115.14	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	end up paying zero taxes so the actor	117.18	3.54
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	story that I was trying to tell you it	119.04	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	was a simple message to put across the	120.72	4.02
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	point that the systems in the world not	122.64	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	just in our country are designed in such	124.74	4.26
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	a way where rich people benefit now this	126.54	3.779
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	is not something new right this is	129.0	2.879
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	something that all of us know now let's	130.319	3.42
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	move to the bottom of the starter of the	131.879	3.36
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	society now in India you would have seen	133.739	3.061
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	that there are a lot of benefits for	135.239	3.781
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	example poor people can get in line get	136.8	4.079
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	treated at aims or a bunch of other	139.02	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	hospitals of course you have to wait a	140.879	3.36
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	lot yes they deserve it I am not trying	142.62	3.479
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	to take away those advantages I am	144.239	3.36

iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	a good job and that good job used to pay	209.04	4.44
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	you a lot of money and there was a stark	211.319	3.901
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	difference between people who were in	213.48	3.0
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	the middle class versus the lower	215.22	3.12
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	starter of the society I'm not talking	216.48	3.479
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	about Ultra rich people because they are	218.34	3.36
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	anyways Rich so they will anyways keep	219.959	3.36
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	on making money so we are not comparing	221.7	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	that part of the society now with time	223.319	4.021
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	what has started to happen is that the	225.36	4.019
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	middle class jobs have started to pay	227.34	3.84
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	less a classic case in point is that	229.379	4.021
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	compare the salaries of let's say TCS 10	231.18	4.68
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	years ago versus now and compute how	233.4	4.619
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	much has it grown by the short answer is	235.86	4.2
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	that it has not grown much on the flip	238.019	4.5
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	side if you compared jobs where not too	240.06	4.2
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	much skill is required for example if	242.519	3.661
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	you want to drive like Ola Uber or if	244.26	3.96
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	you want to become a swiggy zomato	246.18	3.96
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	delivery person then you can do these	248.22	3.84
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	jobs it is not a very high skill job per	250.14	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	se you need to be hard working and these	252.06	3.899
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	jobs are also paying reasonably well so	253.86	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	the gap between the middle class and the	255.959	3.661
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	lower start of the society has started	257.76	4.02
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	to come down and as a result I feel that	259.62	4.32
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	going forward in the future the size of	261.78	3.359
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	the middle class will be really really	263.94	3.12
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	low either you are going to be very rich	265.139	3.601
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	or you are going to fall in that lower	267.06	3.78
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	startup of the society another Trend at	268.74	3.959
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	play is the number of jobs that you can	270.84	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	pursue in one time for example if you	272.699	3.481
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	are doing a corporate job all this stuff	274.56	2.699
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	will happen that you can't do like	276.18	2.34
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	multiple jobs you can't build like	277.259	3.241
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	parallel income this that but if you go	278.52	3.959
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	and meet people who are driving like Ola	280.5	3.84
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	they will drive Ola in the morning they	282.479	3.961
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	will drive Uber at night they might also	284.34	3.78
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	be doing some kind of deliveries so	286.44	3.3
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	people are doing multiple jobs from the	288.12	3.299
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	lower start of the society and getting	289.74	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	richer but on the flip side the middle	291.419	3.661
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	class people the traditional middle	293.46	3.36
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	class jobs which were corporate jobs	295.08	3.54
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	those are paying lesser and lesser with	296.82	4.2
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	time and this middle class poor divide	298.62	4.44
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	is getting Abridged and going forward	301.02	4.26
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	this trend is only going to accelerate	303.06	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	now when it comes to middle class say	305.28	3.96
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	giving taxes becomes really really tough	306.96	3.84
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	so let me walk you through some examples	309.24	3.42
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	Ultra Elite in India what they typically	310.8	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	do is that they are not parking their	312.66	3.479
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	money just in like mutual funds they	314.46	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	have like hedge fund managers who invest	316.139	3.901
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	their money in wide variety of assets	318.36	3.3
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	their tax treatment is also better	320.04	3.3
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	sometimes you would have seen that	321.66	3.42
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	people like Mr Warren Buffett they end	323.34	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	up paying lesser income tax compared to	325.08	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	their secretaries so this type of stuff	327.0	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	happens in India also why is that the	328.68	4.2
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	case because most of the rich people own	330.72	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	some kind of business so there are a lot	332.88	3.84
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	of tax advantages that comes with it a	334.62	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	classic case in point is the GST	336.72	3.96
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	equation in India so for example if I go	338.34	4.62
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	on Amazon and try to buy a laptop I will	340.68	4.68
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	straight away get an 18 rebate on that	342.96	4.26
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	because I am a digital entrepreneur I	345.36	4.02
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	can buy that product legally in India	347.22	4.8
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	and claim GST input credit on it but you	349.38	4.74
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	as a normal salaried people or a normal	352.02	4.38
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	salaried middle class person it might be	354.12	4.079
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	very tough for you to save these type of	356.4	3.84
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	taxes so straight away you are paying 18	358.199	4.44
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	more tax let me give you another example	360.24	4.32
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	for example if you are a salary middle	362.639	4.081
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	class person in India even before you	364.56	3.96
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	get get your money let's imagine that	366.72	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	your salary is one lakh Rupee and that	368.52	3.179
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	is the amount of money you should be	370.44	3.539
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	getting first that you know you will	371.699	4.801
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	have to pay TDS whatever TDs is cut then	373.979	4.321
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	the money will hit your bank account and	376.5	3.12
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	that is the amount of money that you	378.3	2.94
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	will end up having but on the flip side	379.62	3.48
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	if you're managing a business then doing	381.24	3.899
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	tax planning and saving taxes legally	383.1	3.96
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	becomes much more efficient now let's	385.139	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	talk about investment product so I	387.06	3.78
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	earlier gave you the example on the	389.039	4.081
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	video about a famous actress buying a	390.84	4.44
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	house and offsetting her taxes so to say	393.12	4.26
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	do you get these type of rebates or	395.28	4.259
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	indexation benefits in fixed deposits	397.38	4.02
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	the answer is no where majority of the	399.539	3.421
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	middle class invest their money the	401.4	3.299
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	majority invest in fixed deposits	402.96	3.679
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	similarly	404.699	4.56
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	we can go in equities we can go in	406.639	4.361
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	mutual funds and try to save our taxes	409.259	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	they are also indexation benefits are	411.0	3.18
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	not there now you will say that no	412.979	2.701
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	accept that is not correct you know	414.18	2.76
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	there are something called as Equity	415.68	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	linked saving schemes we can claim ATC	416.94	4.08
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	deduction this deduction that deduction	419.34	5.16
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	yes but check for how long these ATC and	421.02	5.399
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	other limits that has been prescribed	424.5	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	they have State intact so these are 10	426.419	3.481
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	10 year old their limits have also not	428.16	3.12
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	been increased has the inflation	429.9	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	increased yes hundred percent so I'm not	431.28	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	trying to get into a rant but think	433.5	3.06
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	about it that you know all the	435.0	3.24
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	structures that are available for middle	436.56	3.84
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	class people it is very hard for them to	438.24	4.019

iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	structure is designed in such a way that	442.259	3.181
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	first you pay the government and then	444.06	3.419
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	you get your money so all these becomes	445.44	4.14
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	extremely frustrating points for the	447.479	3.901
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	middle class and it keeps them poor you	449.58	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	let me know in the comment box that is	451.38	3.659
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	this situation going to get better or	453.3	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	worse and do consider sharing this video	455.039	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	because the budget session is coming up	456.9	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	probably this is going to be a very very	458.639	3.481
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	important budget next year is the	460.5	3.24
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	election year so maybe if we start	462.12	2.88
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	building some pressure on the government	463.74	3.359
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	at least for a couple of years we might	465.0	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	see a lot of benefits so the key problem	467.099	3.241
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	that the middle class faces today and	468.66	3.42
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	this problem is going to go up with time	470.34	3.78
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	is the aspiration problem aspiration	472.08	3.78
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	problem simply means that we want more	474.12	3.479
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	and more and more bigger house bigger	475.86	3.899
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	bigger this that right now this is	477.599	3.841
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	basically being propagated by the	479.759	3.541
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	Instagram culture that a lot of Youth	481.44	3.539
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	right now if you are somewhere between	483.3	4.2
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	like 15 to 25 group you have been	484.979	4.081
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	curated or your brain has been	487.5	3.18
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	cultivated in such a way that you keep	489.06	3.3
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	on getting stressed about what other	490.68	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	people have rather than what you have if	492.36	3.239
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	you are making like let's say one lakh	494.28	3.18
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	rupee you are probably the richest five	495.599	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	percent people in India but are you	497.46	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	happy majority of the cases the answer	499.199	3.961
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	will be no this is an aspiration problem	501.12	4.259
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	and this problem is only extrapolating	503.16	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	with time now if you think about rich	505.379	3.781
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	people or Ultra rich people for example	507.06	4.44
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	adanis ambanis and the likes or people	509.16	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	who are making like in excess of maybe	511.5	4.08
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	like 15 lakh rupees a month they can	513.06	4.979
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	fulfill almost 99.99 of their	515.58	4.199
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	aspirations if you speak about the	518.039	3.781
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	bottom starter of the society their	519.779	3.44
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	aspiration is	521.82	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	and we are good with that but when it	523.219	4.06
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	comes to the middle class that is	525.54	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	precisely where the problem lies because	527.279	4.261
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	we want much more than the resources	529.2	4.5
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	that we have and that kind of stresses	531.54	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	us out key problem that the middle class	533.7	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	is facing right now is the expense	535.44	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	problem what I'm trying to communicate	537.36	3.12
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	is let's see you might have heard of	539.16	2.94
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	something called as inflation that is a	540.48	3.12
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	government officiated number but	542.1	3.359
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	expenses go up for different different	543.6	4.38
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	items very differently for example if	545.459	4.5
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	you consider food food inflation happens	547.98	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	slightly differently if you talk about	549.959	4.081
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	medical inflation that is roughly 14	551.88	4.44
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	this year one four and the general level	554.04	4.02
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	inflation is seven percent so that is	556.32	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	almost 2x similarly if you consider	558.06	3.719
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	education then the inflation is much	559.92	3.479
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	higher there so to cut the long story	561.779	3.841
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	short the price rise is happening much	563.399	4.321
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	faster for the middle class compared to	565.62	3.839
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	the lower end of the society now you	567.72	2.78
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	will say that okay	569.459	3.481
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	inflation yes it is true but I don't	570.5	3.82
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	think that advani ji will stress about	572.94	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	FS grocery bill three X's or four X's	574.32	4.139
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	right so yes inflation can be a problem	576.6	3.359
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	for the rich class also and it is	578.459	4.201
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	happening there as well but the rise in	579.959	4.741
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	inflation or general rise in priciness	582.66	3.78
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	of certain things is hitting the middle	584.7	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	class more now consider for example this	586.44	3.839
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	chart what you would notice is and this	588.6	2.94
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	is something that you will see from your	590.279	3.24
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	own example also that education for	591.54	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	example when I was in class 10th and	593.519	4.26
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	12th my school fever 500 rupees in class	595.2	4.8
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	12 and I was going to a decent private	597.779	4.62
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	school now consider the inflation that	600.0	4.38
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	has happened in just school fees and who	602.399	3.841
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	do you think avails the most amount of	604.38	4.139
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	Education it is unfortunately or	606.24	4.02
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	fortunately the middle class and	608.519	3.901
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	therefore the expenses for them is	610.26	4.079
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	growing at a much faster rate compared	612.42	3.96
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	to any other stata of the society in	614.339	4.321
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	India and this becomes a real problem so	616.38	3.899
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	the final Point why I feel that the	618.66	3.06
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	middle class is going to suffer even	620.279	3.481
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	more in the future is the extent of	621.72	3.84
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	confusion so let's say that you want to	623.76	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	go to Delhi and you are in Goa you will	625.56	3.54
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	have to go towards north so you are	627.66	3.119
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	taking a right journey and someday you	629.1	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	will reach there so that confusion is	630.779	3.541
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	less therefore you are able to move in	632.82	2.76
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	the right direction now what is	634.32	2.459
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	happening with the middle class right	635.58	2.879
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	now is that we are confused about so	636.779	2.601
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	many things	638.459	3.241
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	where to invest if you have to study	639.38	3.94
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	should we go abroad or not go abroad	641.7	3.66
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	should I quit my job should I experiment	643.32	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	with business should I go on Shark Tank	645.36	3.12
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	should I like you know do this should I	646.92	3.479
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	invest my money in FD there's so much	648.48	4.14
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	confusion going on around every single	650.399	4.081
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	thing so that Clarity of thought is not	652.62	3.3
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	there and we don't know in which	654.48	3.299
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	direction we are going and if we don't	655.92	3.9
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	know in which direction we are going it	657.779	4.921
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	just stresses us out we are unhappier we	659.82	4.74
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	don't know what to do with our life we	662.7	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	feel a little bit dejected and that	664.56	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	creates creates a bunch of problems for	666.42	3.72
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	us in terms of gaining our focus and	668.16	3.48
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	doing anything productive now think	670.14	3.12
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	about rich people that rich people have	671.64	4.04
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	a very clear plan business	673.26	4.56
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	now I have to just take it over or	675.68	3.76
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	whatever I want to do with it on the	677.82	3.3
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	flip side people who are not from a very	679.44	3.42
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	affluent family who are in that bottom	681.12	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	start of the society they also have a	682.86	3.539
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	very clear goal so we will work hard and	684.72	3.6
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	we will progress so Clarity is there	686.399	4.201
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	with the rich class Clarity is still to	688.32	4.079
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	a very large extent there with the lower	690.6	4.02
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	end segment of the society but that	692.399	3.841
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	Clarity is missing in the middle class	694.62	4.02
iyvvlBGC1_c	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvvlBGC1_c	and unless you can think clearly and	696.24	4.68

dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you're going to the real estate market	40.98	3.0
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	or if you are investing with certain	42.18	3.48
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	companies they will help you weave like	43.98	3.599
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	Swahili so I was speaking to a builder	45.66	3.6
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	from North Goa and he said that you know	47.579	2.941
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	what we are constructing like really	49.26	3.18
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	nice properties and properties were very	50.52	3.48
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	nice no doubt about that so I asked him	52.44	3.299
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	that you know what I want to buy like a	54.0	3.899
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	2bhk so tell me what would be the price	55.739	4.021
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	so he said two and a half crores for a	57.899	4.741
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	two B HK flat in Goa so that really blew	59.76	4.38
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	my mind because according to me the	62.64	3.24
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	prices should not be that high so I told	64.14	2.94
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	him that you know what the math does not	65.88	3.0
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	add up Goa is not that expensive a	67.08	3.06
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	market so why are you selling it for two	68.88	2.7
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	and a half crores he said that in what	70.14	2.94
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	I'll explain you the math so here is the	71.58	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	math do it with me every day that you do	73.08	4.02
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	short-term rentals in Goa you can make	75.24	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	between six to ten thousand in that	77.1	3.6
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	location so the location was also very	79.02	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	good and assume only 50 percent	80.7	4.32
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	occupancy of your house then how much	82.68	4.14
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	will you are making so approximately we	85.02	3.48
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	quickly run the mat so six thousand	86.82	3.72
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	times 180 and it will give you roughly	88.5	3.96
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	10 lakh rupee of rental income so the	90.54	3.48
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	yield comes out to be roughly five to	92.46	3.24
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	six percent I am doing muta Mota math	94.02	3.18
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	with you so it made a lot of sense	95.7	3.54
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	because in major cities like Delhi or	97.2	3.959
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	Mumbai the rental yield is usually three	99.24	3.0
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	percent so if you are getting six	101.159	3.121
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	percent yield for that property anyone	102.24	3.9
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	would get enticed but this is how you	104.28	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	get trapped because when you are doing	106.14	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	short-term rentals you will lose at	107.64	4.2
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	least 40 50 margin so decrease that from	109.5	4.259
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	your yield on top of that if you are	111.84	3.48
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	buying from such Builders they will	113.759	3.241
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	charge you management fees also so I	115.32	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	asked him that how much management slash	117.0	2.88
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	maintenance fee are you going to charge	118.68	2.82
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	me so I am going to charge you like	119.88	3.419
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	eight to ten thousand per month on that	121.5	3.719
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	flat so now you tell me that if you run	123.299	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	all these numbers what their interview	125.219	3.001
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	will come out to be so it will come out	126.659	3.361
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	to be exactly like Delhi and Mumbai now	128.22	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	this is frequently happening with	130.02	3.42
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	investment apps also and a bunch of	131.58	4.44
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	companies are running their offers of	133.44	4.2
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	account and you are going to become like	136.02	3.54
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	multi-millionaires so please be aware	137.64	3.84
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	about the type of financial deal that	139.56	3.72
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you are getting in the market and do not	141.48	3.479
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	get trapped just because someone is	143.28	3.24
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	showing you a partial picture the second	144.959	3.301
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	key point is that we must understand how	146.52	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	to budget people unfortunately have made	148.26	3.9
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	budgeting extremely complicated this is	150.18	4.26
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	one of the simplest Finance Concepts or	152.16	4.32
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	personal finance Concepts out there are	154.44	4.019
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	grandparents parents everyone used to	156.48	4.02
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	budget now unfortunately with the use of	158.459	5.541
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	excessive tools spreadsheet Excel	160.5	6.06
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	so it is becoming harder and harder to	164.0	4.06
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	budget at least for majority of the	166.56	2.7
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	people there is something called as	168.06	2.94
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	getting overwhelmed with things for	169.26	3.059
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	example these days you might have	171.0	3.12
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	noticed that you get overwhelmed with	172.319	3.661
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	content that you go on Netflix so much	174.12	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	content is available that you end up	175.98	2.94
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	choosing nothing you just scroll through	177.48	3.24
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	and go away so same is happening with	178.92	3.179
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	budgeting that people are really	180.72	3.06
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	struggling to budget so let me help you	182.099	3.241
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	understand how you can budget properly	183.78	3.12
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	and let me explain five simple	185.34	3.42
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	techniques so technique number one is	186.9	3.96
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	called as balanced budget formula and it	188.76	4.38
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	is called as the 50 30 and 20 rule also	190.86	3.72
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you might have heard it thousands of	193.14	2.819
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	times that you know what you should have	194.58	4.079
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	like 50 for your needs 30 for your wants	195.959	4.261
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	and twenty percent for your desires this	198.659	3.421
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	is very common mistake and it is also a	200.22	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	very boring formula most of the people	202.08	3.12
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	do not follow it what is the number one	203.58	3.12
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	reason especially because of the fact	205.2	3.42
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	that if you are just starting to earn	206.7	4.2
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you would struggle doing this 50 30 20	208.62	4.259
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	for example when I started my first job	210.9	4.259
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	I was getting paid like 10 12 000 rupees	212.879	4.741
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	I had no money at that point in time so	215.159	4.261
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	if I would have followed this formula I	217.62	3.24
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	would have deliberately failed and I	219.42	2.399
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	would have thought that you know what	220.86	2.82
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	budgeting is nonsense so for such people	221.819	4.441
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	using this 50 30 20 formula is pretty	223.68	4.139
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	much nonsensical what you should do is	226.26	3.3
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	that you should adopt philosophy number	227.819	3.901
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	two or method number two which is called	229.56	4.319
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	as that if you save zero you must save	231.72	3.9
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	one now what is the meaning of this well	233.879	3.241
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	it has a very simple meaning so for	235.62	3.179
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	example let's say that currently your	237.12	3.6
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	savings rate is 0 are saying now what is	238.799	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	your goal for next month it is very	240.72	3.54
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	simple that just save one percent of	242.159	4.14
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	your salary and try to earn one percent	244.26	4.32
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	to it every successive month now to what	246.299	3.961
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	extent should you be doing it you should	248.58	4.32
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	at least hit a number of 20 so that is	250.26	4.44
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	the goal or Vision with page you can	252.9	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	start budgeting and it will get you in	254.7	3.719
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	the habit of budgeting and will make	256.56	3.84
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	this entire exercise of budgeting more	258.419	3.961
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	effective and enjoyable for you now	260.4	3.48
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	comes the third technique of budgeting	262.38	3.24
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	and it is called as envelope budgeting	263.88	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	it works wonderfully well for people	265.62	4.079
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	like me who usually want to spend money	267.24	4.56
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	in cash now why do I prefer spending	269.699	3.72
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	money in cash because it becomes very	271.8	4.679
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	easy for you to track stuff so I usually	273.419	5.401
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	avoid paying money in plastic format or	276.479	4.381
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	in UPI format simply because of the fact	278.82	3.96
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	that once you see your money going out	280.86	4.38
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	in Hard Cash format it Little Bit Hurts	282.78	4.139
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you so what you need to do is that for	285.24	3.0
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	example let's say that you have four	286.919	3.361
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	prominent expenses in a month so you buy	288.24	4.26
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	an envelope now your total major for	290.28	3.54
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	these four items would be fifteen	292.5	2.94
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	thousand so you withdraw money from your	293.82	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	ATM and you put it in an envelope and	295.44	3.9
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	then give it and this envelope budgeting	297.6	3.659
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	gets you in a habit of spending cash	299.34	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	which I highly recommend rather than	301.259	3.781
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	using plastic money now comes the fourth	303.12	3.48
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	budgeting method and this is for people	305.04	3.42
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	who are doing reasonably well who are	306.6	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	making good money now for those people	308.46	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	they should value their time more rather	310.38	3.539
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	than doing Chinese with small small	312.24	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	stuff so here I would recommend that you	313.919	3.84
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	follow a big money versus small money	316.02	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	budgeting method so what happens here is	317.759	2.94
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	that let's say that you are making	319.68	2.579
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	really good money for example let's say	320.699	3.121
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	five lakh rupees now you should only	322.259	3.361
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	track your big expenses forget about	323.82	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	like small small expenses so that	325.62	3.84
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	segregation method is called as tracking	327.6	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	big money and not worrying too much	329.46	4.26
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	about small money here retail stores so	330.96	4.38
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you don't need to put that on your Excel	333.72	3.18
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	spreadsheet and waste your time Fifth	335.34	3.06
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	and final point is called as the fun	336.9	3.12
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	money stage so this happens when you	338.4	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	have almost become an hni so for example	340.02	4.08
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	at my stage currently what I simply do	342.06	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	is that I have a one percent fund money	344.1	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	rule so basically whatever money I'm	345.84	3.18
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	making in a month I will take that one	347.46	3.72
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	percent money out for fun activities and	349.02	4.26
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	I tag it as fun money budget so ideally	351.18	3.72
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you should move towards this stage where	353.28	3.24
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you do not even have to track or do	354.9	3.06
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	anything with that fun money with it	356.52	3.119
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	rest of the major expenses you continue	357.96	3.6
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	to track so the third point is that you	359.639	4.201
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	must avoid debt in most circumstances	361.56	4.8
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	and do not fall prey to the lucrative	363.84	4.5
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	debt that is given out for example when	366.36	3.54
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	I was purchasing this car the	368.34	3.12
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	salesperson called me up and said that	369.9	3.18
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you know what do you want a debt on your	371.46	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	car it will be an awesome deal for you	373.08	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	we will give you this rebate we'll give	375.12	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you that debate I the basic point that	376.74	3.6
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you must know is that car is an	378.78	3.419
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	unproductive debt please do not take a	380.34	3.96
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	debt on car or majority of the consumer	382.199	3.421
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	items that you are buying it is not	384.3	3.179
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	useful at all if you are taking debt to	385.62	3.84
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	buy real estate yes there are offsetting	387.479	3.901
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	benefits there is interest debate you	389.46	3.959
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	can claim ATC so all these are basic	391.38	3.539
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	basic points that you must understand	393.419	3.601
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	now what ends up happening is that when	394.919	4.321
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you go and extend this logic to buying	397.02	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	like consumer items you go and speak	399.24	3.239
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	with sales person they will convince you	400.8	3.54
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	that taking a date is awesome and you	402.479	3.901
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	will fall into that trip these days so	404.34	3.6
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	many people go and read it up online	406.38	3.48
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	what they are told is that hey you know	407.94	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	what that if you go and max out your	409.86	3.42
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	credit cards your credit score will	411.6	3.719
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	improve your civil score will improve no	413.28	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	this is complete nonsense there is	415.319	3.181
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	something called as credit utilization	416.94	3.539
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	for example if you can hypothetically	418.5	4.08
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	speaking take 1 lakh rupee of debt now	420.479	3.901
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you keep on maxing that limit on one	422.58	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	lakh rupee and even if you make regular	424.38	4.08
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	payments even then your civil score will	426.36	3.72
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	get hurt so all these are complicated	428.46	3.42
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	things if you don't understand this game	430.08	3.959
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	generally just avoid taking debt now	431.88	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	another related Point here is that	434.039	3.421
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	people often get confused that when they	435.66	3.539
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	should be repaying their debt quickly	437.46	3.54
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	whether they should do it right now for	439.199	3.241
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	the interest rates are high and this	441.0	3.18
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	calculation also becomes extremely	442.44	3.72
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	complicated so what is the simple rule	444.18	3.54
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	that you need to follow here it is this	446.16	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	just simply go and check what the	447.72	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	interest rate history of India is and	449.52	3.36
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you will generally get a sense whether	451.5	3.599
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	right now in the economy interest rates	452.88	4.08
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	are high or low so for example if you	455.099	4.621
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	check it sitting in January of 2023 you	456.96	4.32
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	will easily figure out that hey interest	459.72	3.599
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	rates right now are very very high they	461.28	3.72
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	are much higher than our Target rate of	463.319	3.301
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	inflation so in a high interest rate	465.0	3.84
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	environment you must try to repay your	466.62	4.26
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	rate as quickly as possible Point number	468.84	4.02
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	four is that you must avoid modern day	470.88	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	mumbo jumbo now what do I mean by that	472.86	3.6
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	let me outline that by giving you two	474.66	3.659
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	examples many of us would have heard of	476.46	4.26
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	buy now pay later and line operator what	478.319	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	happens is that you don't have the money	480.72	3.3
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you buy stuff now and you figure out a	481.979	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	way to pay later it's a new way of	484.02	3.299
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	getting you to spend more take a look at	485.759	3.06
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	this chart and what you will see is that	487.319	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	in America this concept has gone up by	488.819	4.921
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	almost 46 percent in one single year so	490.979	4.261
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	the point is that people are actually	493.74	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	doing this stuff so then next six months	495.24	4.139
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	some new innovation will happen and it	497.52	3.6
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	is already happening so what that	499.379	4.44
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	Innovation is it is called as snbl save	501.12	4.979
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	now buy later so this is another variant	503.819	4.32
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	of it now six months after some new	506.099	3.961
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	stuff will happen so the point is that	508.139	3.721
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	there are a lot of companies that just	510.06	3.659
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	innovate for the heck of innovating so	511.86	3.539
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	let me give you another example here so	513.719	3.361
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	there are a lot of fintech startups what	515.399	3.181
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	they do is that you know what wiser if	517.08	3.0
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you're going and buying some stuff we	518.58	3.12
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	will round it off and we will help you	520.08	3.3
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	invest in some mutual fund now think	521.7	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	about it this way that that fintech	523.38	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	company is also making money no so you	525.36	3.12
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	are buying one layer of commission to	527.16	3.06
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	mutual fund you are paying second layer	528.48	3.539
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	of commission to that fintech company so	530.22	3.66
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	all this mumbo jumbo simply eats into	532.019	3.841
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	your returns you must get a basic	533.88	4.019
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	Financial understanding of what savings	535.86	4.86
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	investing is just execute that on your	537.899	4.681
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	own try to start in a very simple way	540.72	3.54
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	and complicate your systems over time	542.58	3.6
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	all right so Point number five is that	544.26	3.72
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	you must fill your emergency fund now	546.18	3.839
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	this is like such an important advice	547.98	4.44
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	and people just believe it to be ubiquis	550.019	4.861
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	and true at every single juncture no	552.42	4.56
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	this is a very interesting and important	554.88	4.2
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	point that you must understand it is not	556.98	3.84
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	as if that you should continue to build	559.08	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	your emergency fund irrespective of the	560.82	4.079
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	environment yes you must build an	562.86	3.9
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	emergency fund but then comes the choice	564.899	3.721
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	whether you further build that emergency	566.76	4.079
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	fund and a lot of it is dictated by	568.62	4.08
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	economics so for example when the	570.839	3.721
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	interest rates in the economy is close	572.7	3.78
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	to zero percent and if you are going and	574.56	3.959

dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	trap is that please avoid premium or	765.06	4.56
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	premium services in majority of the	767.339	4.56
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	cases and please buy older model of	769.62	4.2
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	things a classic case in point is the	771.899	3.841
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	debate between buying iPhone 14 pro	773.82	4.38

dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	one of the Prime reasons that it happens	788.399	3.421
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	is that Tech becomes outdated fairly	789.899	3.721
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	fast so the new tech that is coming in	791.82	3.24
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	the market they will charge you	793.62	4.14
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	extensive premium on that Tech and the	795.06	4.68

dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	going to discount it so always try to	799.74	4.02

dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	the market it will give you a better Roi	803.76	4.199
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	without impacting your pocket as much	805.92	3.599
dZ06UKEkXp8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ06UKEkXp8	this is applicable to literally	807.959	3.361

GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	what accounts you should open up,	25.26	1.53
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and all the things that you
should and shouldn't be doing	26.79	2.85
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	when it comes to investing.	29.64	1.53
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- This is a critical mistake people make.	31.17	1.89
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	And it will cost you hundreds
of thousands of dollars.	33.06	2.28
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- This video is sponsored by Squarespace.	35.34	2.22
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	More on them later.	37.56	1.38
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	My early twenties weren't exactly	38.94	1.53
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	my most productive financial years.	40.47	1.86
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I remember counting
pennies in line at Wendy's	42.33	1.98
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	to get their $1 chicken sandwich.	44.31	1.89
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	And if you're in a similar situation,	46.2	1.98
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	it might feel impossible	48.18	1.38
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	to even start thinking about investing,	49.56	2.1
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and that's because you probably shouldn't.	51.66	2.52
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Before you open up your
first investment account,	54.18	2.19
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	there are two big steps
that you need to take	56.37	1.95
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	that most personal finance
experts can agree on.	58.32	2.37
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	First, you need to build
up an emergency fund.	60.69	2.4
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You can start with a month of savings,	63.09	1.65
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	but eventually, you should get it up	64.74	1.35
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	to three to six months of basic expenses.	66.09	2.7
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	We're talking about the bare minimum:	68.79	1.53
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	rent, utilities, groceries, and gas.	70.32	2.22
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	What is the absolute minimum
that you need to get by on?	72.54	2.7
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	And second, you should
pay off all of your debt	75.24	2.31
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	except for your house.	77.55	1.32
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You specifically wanna focus on the debt	78.87	1.98
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	with the highest interest rates,	80.85	1.68
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	so those credit cards,
student loans, and car loans	82.53	3.33
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	that are 8%, 9%, 10% or
more should be tackled	85.86	3.6
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	as soon as you've got your
emergency fund filled.	89.46	1.95
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	The power of taking these
two steps alone are huge	91.41	2.94
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	when it comes to your
personal finance journey.	94.35	1.92
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	And they will likely take years of saving,	96.27	3.12
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	patience, frustration, and sacrifice,	99.39	2.97
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	especially if you graduated	102.36	1.47
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	with $100,000 of student debt like I did.	103.83	2.85
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	But once you pay off your last loan,	106.68	2.07
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	you'll finally be ready	108.75	1.05
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	to start investing in the stock market.	109.8	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Warren Buffett once famously said,	111.93	1.837
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	"My wealth has come from a
combination of living in America,	113.767	3.323
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	some lucky genes, and compound interest."	117.09	2.94
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Compound interest is the reason	120.03	1.65
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	you need to start investing
as soon as you possibly can.	121.68	3.03
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- What we know is that	124.71	1.11
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	over the course of a long period of time,	125.82	2.58
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	we're talking 40, 50, 60 years,	128.4	1.98
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	the market tends to return about 7% to 8%.	130.38	3.93
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	That's per year.	134.31	1.23
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	So people go, "Well, is that
a lot? Is that a little?"	135.54	2.28
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Doesn't mean anything to people.	137.82	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	What that means is that your money	139.95	1.53
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	will essentially double every
10 years if you do nothing.	141.48	3.12
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Let's say you invest $5,000
a year from age 25 to 65.	144.6	4.56
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	At an annual return of 8%,	149.16	1.77
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	you'll have a total of
nearly $1.3 million.	150.93	3.18
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	If you chose not to invest	154.11	1.47
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and instead stash the money
away in your sock drawer,	155.58	2.58
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	you would have $200,000.	158.16	2.25
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	That's a difference that
will easily change your life.	160.41	2.64
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- So the minute that I paid
off my last student loan,	163.05	2.22
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I knew that I wanted to start investing,	165.27	1.65
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	but I still had so many questions.	166.92	1.86
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	How do I open an account?
What company do I use?	168.78	2.7
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	How much should I invest?
What stocks do I invest in?	171.48	2.7
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It was truly overwhelming.	174.18	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	There are a number of different accounts	176.31	1.35
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	that you could open up with
varying fees and tax advantages.	177.66	2.79
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	My guess is if you've thought
about investing before	180.45	2.31
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	but haven't taken the leap,	182.76	1.32
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	this is where you've
gotten stuck in the weeds.	184.08	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	So let's break down exactly
what you should be doing	186.21	2.28
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	from the minute that you
decide to start investing.	188.49	2.49
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	In the U.S., if your
employer has a 401k plan	190.98	3.09
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and offers matching contributions,	194.07	2.07
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	then this is the first account	196.14	1.23
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	that you should start investing in,	197.37	0.863
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and you should probably
take advantage of this deal	198.233	2.917
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	even before you finish
paying off all of your debt.	201.15	2.61
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Put as much money into this 401k plan	203.76	2.25
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	as your employer will match.	206.01	1.53
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	After that, the first account	207.54	1.35
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	you should open up is a Roth IRA.	208.89	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	If you meet the income requirements,	211.02	1.47
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	there are some great tax
advantages to Roth IRAs,	212.49	3.09
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and it's why most personal
finance experts recommend it.	215.58	3.12
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	But what companies should
you trust with your money?	218.7	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- There are a few companies I love.	220.83	1.95
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I personally use Vanguard.	222.78	2.25
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I have no financial affiliation with them,	225.03	2.07
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	but that's where I suggested
my wife open her account.	227.1	3.87
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	They're super low-cost.	230.97	1.53
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	They don't get you with a bunch
of fees. That's important.	232.5	2.64
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Fidelity's also very good.
Schwab is also very good.	235.14	2.85
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	All three of these are great.	237.99	1.14
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Some people ask about
robo-advisors. It's really popular.	239.13	3.06
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I think they're fine.	242.19	0.9
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	If you are coming to me, you're saying,	243.09	1.687
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	"Ramit, should I do Wealthfront
or Betterment or Vanguard?"	244.777	2.963
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	There is a slight difference in fees.	247.74	2.34
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You know, you might be
paying about 0.3% more	250.08	2.73
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	for Wealthfront or Betterment.	252.81	1.41
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	In the grand scheme, it's not
the worst thing you could do.	254.22	3.45
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Personally, for me, I
don't think it's worth it.	257.67	2.91
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I don't mind that Vanguard
has a worse interface	260.58	3.24
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	because I hardly log in.	263.82	1.23
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It's not important to me.	265.05	1.17
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	And I want a company that
is focused on low fees.	266.22	3.9
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- So, to keep things simple,	270.12	1.02
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	if you haven't opened an account already,	271.14	1.95
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	just go with Vanguard.	273.09	1.11
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	They've got really low fees,	274.2	1.38
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	give you all the investing
options you need,	275.58	2.19
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and they make it really
easy to get started.	277.77	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Okay, now that you've created an account,	279.9	1.74
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	what do you do next?	281.64	1.11
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Well, you actually need
to invest your money,	282.75	2.49
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and regardless of what your
brother-in-law told you,	285.24	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	investing your life savings into Bitcoin	287.37	2.34
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	is probably a terrible option.	289.71	1.89
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I think when a lot of people	291.6	0.9
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	think about investing in the stock market,	292.5	1.68
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	they think about, like, you said, Tesla.	294.18	1.98
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	They think about investing
in specific companies.	296.16	3.3
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Some of them go,	299.46	1.207
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	"Ramit, why would I invest
in the stock market?	300.667	2.333
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	7%? That's for losers.	303.0	2.37
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Bitcoin, you can average
50% to 60% a year."	305.37	3.21
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I go, "All right, let's start
with some basic math here,	308.58	3.15
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	which you missed the
day they taught that."	311.73	2.85
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	If you're getting 60% returns per year,	314.58	3.24
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	pretty soon you have more money	317.82	1.29
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	than all the money in the universe,	319.11	2.55
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and there are essentially no investments	321.66	2.25
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	that are consistently
getting you 60% returns.	323.91	2.22
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Oftentimes, really what people are doing	326.13	2.22
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	with these highly speculative investments	328.35	2.55
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	is they are admitting	330.9	1.53
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I have lost the game of money for myself	332.43	3.81
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and the only chance I
believe I have to win	336.24	2.79
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	is to buy a lottery ticket.	339.03	1.89
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	And that is not how you invest.
That's not how you do it.	340.92	3.57
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- So, instead of investing
your money into one company,	344.49	2.4
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	one stock, or one risky bet,	346.89	2.1
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	you need to diversify by investing	348.99	1.92
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	in something called an index fund.	350.91	2.55
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	An index fund is a type of investment	353.46	1.95
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	that pulls together stocks, bonds,	355.41	1.89
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and other securities into
one diversified portfolio.	357.3	3.72
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	While there is always a risk
when it comes to investing,	361.02	2.67
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	this reduces the overall amount of risk	363.69	2.49
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	that you need to take.	366.18	0.99
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	What are the investments
that are safe in the long run	367.17	3.81
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	but that will also give us a return	370.98	1.5
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	where we can actually have
a living when we retire?	372.48	2.97
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- I love a target date retirement fund.	375.45	3.96
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You simply pick the year
that you're gonna retire.	379.41	2.97
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Basically, the year you're gonna be 65.	382.38	1.92
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	And you just put all your money into it.	384.3	2.4
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It's automatically
diversified, automatically.	386.7	3.03
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It includes stocks, bonds.	389.73	1.56
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It includes domestic,
large caps, all that,	391.29	2.61
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and you just put as much as you can.	393.9	1.86
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	They charge essentially no fees.	395.76	2.49
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	This is not a financial
advisor that's charging you 1%.	398.25	2.86
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It's just a computer
that's doing it for you.	401.97	2.433
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	People almost find it unbelievable.	405.54	2.22
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	They go, "Ramit, you're telling me	407.76	1.26
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	that I just pick one target date fund,	409.02	3.09
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and I invest in that same fund
in my 401k, in my Roth IRA,	412.11	4.38
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	even in a taxable brokerage account?"	416.49	2.34
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	For the most part, yes.	418.83	1.32
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	For the vast majority of people,	420.15	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	a target date fund is a fantastic thing.	422.28	2.97
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	If I had, like, if I were
telling a brother or sister,	425.25	4.47
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	family member, and they're 25
years old, what should I do?	429.72	2.49
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I'd be like, put every
extra dollar you've got	432.21	3.03
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	in a target date fund and
get on with your life.	435.24	2.61
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- I wanna share the exact
index fund that I invest in	437.85	3.36
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	as well as the strategy you need to know	441.21	1.92
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	once you start investing your
money into the stock market.	443.13	2.88
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	But first, a quick word from
my sponsor, Squarespace.	446.01	2.91
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	So I chose to build my first website	448.92	1.83
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	on Squarespace eight years
ago for three main reasons.	450.75	3.51
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Their templates are beautiful.	454.26	1.35
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It's really simple to make changes,	455.61	2.22
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and you don't need to know any code.	457.83	1.68
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Let me show you exactly how easy it is.	459.51	2.34
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Let's say you wanna create a blog	461.85	1.26
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	documenting your journey out of debt	463.11	1.65
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and towards financial freedom.	464.76	1.83
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You get started by
going to squarespace.com	466.59	2.22
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and buying your first domain name,	468.81	1.65
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	something like mattonthemoney.com.	470.46	2.61
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Next up, you grab a template
that matches your vision.	473.07	2.55
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	This one's perfect. And then the fun part.	475.62	2.19
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You start creating by simply	477.81	1.29
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	dragging and dropping your content,	479.1	1.8
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	set your brand colors, add your logo,	480.9	2.61
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and take that terrifying step	483.51	1.29
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	of writing and publishing
your very first blog post.	484.8	2.7
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I honestly think that everybody
should have a website.	487.5	2.49
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It can help you build an
audience, land a better job,	489.99	2.82

GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	The brands that I choose to
partner with on this channel	504.6	2.16
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	help me to invest back into my videos	506.76	2.25
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	so I can create better content every week.	509.01	2.34
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	If you wanna get started and
make a website for yourself,	511.35	2.22
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	click the link in the description below.	513.57	1.83
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Thanks for considering. I
forgot to turn the camera off.	515.4	5.0
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	All right, so let me show you	520.41	0.9
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	the exact target retirement
fund that I invest into	521.31	3.93
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	when it comes to Vanguard.	525.24	1.83
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	So this is it.	527.07	1.02
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It's the Vanguard target
retirement 2050 fund.	528.09	3.78
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Obviously, if you plan on
retiring earlier or later,	531.87	3.33
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	you would pick a different fund,	535.2	1.35
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	but this is because I plan
on retiring around 2050.	536.55	3.93
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You can see, over the past 10 years,	540.48	1.59
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	it's performing at 8.36% annually.	542.07	3.96
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	After you've actually invested	546.03	1.71
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	your hard-earned money
into the stock market,	547.74	2.52
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	the hard part comes, waiting.	550.26	2.88
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	How you manage your
emotions and risk tolerance	553.14	2.25
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	is one of the most important aspects	555.39	1.8
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	to building wealth over time	557.19	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	because growth isn't a straight line.	559.32	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- It goes like this. It's up. It's down.	561.45	2.88
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Some years it's up 30%.
Some years it's down 6%.	564.33	3.84
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	This year happens to be down.	568.17	1.71
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	But you have to remember
that it was way up	569.88	3.12
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	for the last 10-plus years.	573.0	2.04
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- Most people just can't stomach	575.04	1.47
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	the twists and turns
that the market takes,	576.51	2.46
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and over the past year,	578.97	0.99
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	things have been looking a bit dicey.	579.96	2.37
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- But it does seem we are kind of	582.33	1.35
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	slipping into a recession, doesn't it?	583.68	1.8
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- People are gonna feel a lot of pain.	585.48	1.62
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- Concerns, of course, about
the potential recession,	587.1	2.37
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	they continue to loom.	589.47	1.2
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- In a poll for the Wall Street Journal,	590.67	1.65
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	economist put the probability	592.32	1.38
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	of a recession in the
next 12 months at 61%.	593.7	3.72
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- And the fear is that we
are much more likely now	597.42	3.06
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	heading toward a recession.	600.48	1.23
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- What would you say to somebody	601.71	1.44
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	who sees this happening right now	603.15	3.18
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and wants to pull their
money out of their 401k?	606.33	3.36
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- If you do this, you are doomed.	609.69	1.56
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It's one of the worst financial
decisions you can make	611.25	2.43
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	to try to pull your money out.	613.68	1.17
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Let me explain.	614.85	0.87
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It's called timing the market	615.72	1.8
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	when you try to pull it
out at the right time	617.52	2.67
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and then get back in at the right time.	620.19	1.74
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	There's several problems with this.	621.93	1.68
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	First of all, you don't know	623.61	1.86
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	if it's gonna go lower or higher.	625.47	1.86
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	And people go, "Well,
dude, it's so obvious."	627.33	2.52
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It's actually not obvious.	629.85	1.56
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	People said it was obvious
in 2008, 9, 10, 16, 20, 22.	631.41	3.323
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It's not obvious. It can
go up. It can go down.	637.53	2.37
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	The market does what
the market's gonna do.	639.9	2.07
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You cannot predict it.	641.97	1.5
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Second, even if you pulled
it out at a great time	643.47	3.15
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	where things are really
high, and then it goes low,	646.62	4.17
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	you need to be right a second time	650.79	2.64
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	to put it in at the right time.	653.43	2.04
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	The solution is to simply invest	655.47	2.22
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	every single month consistently.	657.69	2.31
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Doesn't matter whether it's up.	660.0	1.2
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Doesn't matter whether it's
down because you don't know	661.2	2.25
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	where that fits in the overall scheme.	663.45	2.52
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Every month you set up an
automation in your Vanguard,	665.97	2.88
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Fidelity, Schwab account,	668.85	1.62
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and it might be $100, it might
be $1000, it might be $5,000.	670.47	3.96
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It's just continually going in.	674.43	2.19
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	So when it's expensive,
you're buying fewer shares.	676.62	2.76
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	When it's cheaper, you're
buying more shares.	679.38	1.98
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Over time, that strategy
called dollar cost averaging	681.36	2.7
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	tends to dramatically
outperform timing the market.	684.06	3.81
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- I remember the day that
I first invested money	687.87	1.98
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	into the stock market through Vanguard.	689.85	1.74
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I knew that I wasn't supposed
to be checking these accounts.	691.59	3.27
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I had read books by Ramit
and others that told me so,	694.86	3.3
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	but I couldn't help it.	698.16	0.87
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I refreshed that thing every single day,	699.03	2.25
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	tracking the changes and
watching as it went up and down.	701.28	4.05
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	But eventually, I decided
to stop obsessing,	705.33	2.97
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and I just let the investments	708.3	1.74
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	do their work in the background,	710.04	1.62
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and it was the best decision that I made.	711.66	1.86
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Now I check in every six months
to see how things are going.	713.52	3.78
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	And over the past eight years, on average,	717.3	2.97
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I've returned about 8% annually.	720.27	2.91
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	If you invested $5,000 per
year over the same time period,	723.18	3.96
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	you'd have made $13,000 in interest.	727.14	2.76
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	And if you remember that graph
from earlier in this video,	729.9	2.7
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	if you keep investing,	732.6	1.23
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	your money will soon grow exponentially.	733.83	2.19
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	That is, of course,	736.02	0.833
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	unless you make one
fatal investing mistake.	736.853	2.617
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- This is a critical mistake people make,	739.47	2.16
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and it will cost you hundreds
of thousands of dollars.	741.63	3.0
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	A lot of you watching have parents	744.63	2.01
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	who are using a financial advisor.	746.64	1.65
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I want you to pull out
your phone right now.	748.29	1.56
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I want you to text mommy and
daddy, and I want you to say,	749.85	2.827
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	"Hey, how much are you paying Chet,	752.677	2.663
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	our neighborhood financial advisor?"	755.34	2.4
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Chet, when he gets the question,	757.74	1.71
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	is going to go into a
very long monologue about,	759.45	2.227
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	"Well, you know, we're
here to protect your money.	761.677	1.943
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I wanna keep you safe, and
I'm always looking over it,	763.62	2.1
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and blah, I'm making decisions.	765.72	2.0
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	(bleep) Chet is ripping your parents off.	767.72	2.59
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Chet is charging: I can almost guarantee,	770.31	1.89
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	a 1% assets under management fee.	772.2	3.63
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Now, you go, "1%, what's the big deal?	775.83	1.32
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	That's not bad to have
somebody look over it."	777.15	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Over the course of your lifetime,	779.28	0.99
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	if you pay a 1% fee, 28% of your returns	780.27	3.57
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	will go right into your advisor's pocket.	783.84	2.4
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	If you pay a 2% fee, which some
of these ripoff artists do,	786.24	4.14
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	you will pay over 50% of your returns	790.38	3.3
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	straight into their pocket.	793.68	1.74
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	If you have a modest income,
you're starting in your 20s:	795.42	1.74
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	it could be hundreds of
thousands of dollars.	797.16	2.31
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Most finances we've heard
today, it's really simple.	799.47	2.49
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Target date fund, automate your money,	801.96	2.19
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	focus on living your life.	804.15	1.47
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	But if you really need a financial advisor	805.62	1.74
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	because things have gotten complicated	807.36	1.71
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	or you have stepchildren or
all kinds of crazy stuff,	809.07	3.36
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	fine, pay an hourly fee or a project fee,	812.43	3.36
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	but never a percentage of
assets under management.	815.79	3.48
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- Since personal finance and investing	819.27	1.71
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	is really different for everyone,	820.98	1.71
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	it requires you to do
a bit of extra research	822.69	2.04
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	to make sure that you're making	824.73	1.17
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	the best decision for
yourself and your family.	825.9	2.16
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	So to help you identify	828.06	1.5
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	what you should and
shouldn't be doing right now,	829.56	2.61
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	I've linked to some
really helpful resources	832.17	2.31
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	in the description below this video.	834.48	2.16
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	There are some flow charts	836.64	1.44
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	from the personal finance Subreddit	838.08	2.04
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	that I've found to be very helpful,	840.12	1.89
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and I also highly recommend	842.01	1.26
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	you check out Ramit Sethi's book,	843.27	1.237
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	"I Will Teach You to Be Rich".	844.507	1.643
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	It helped me out a ton
when I first got started,	846.15	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and I think it'll help you as well.	848.28	1.8
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	As you start to dig into
your own personal finances,	850.08	2.31
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	it's often easy to lose
sight of the big picture:	852.39	2.55
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	the reason why it's so important	854.94	1.47
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	to start investing, to begin with.	856.41	1.68
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Say somebody just starts getting
into personal finance now,	858.09	2.43
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	what advice would you give them?	860.52	2.13
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	- I think money is an
amazing source of joy,	862.65	3.51
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	and I think when we
typically think about money,	866.16	3.09
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	it feels like flossing to us.	869.25	1.567
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	"Ah, I really should like
do something with my 401k."	870.817	2.933
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	So I always start by asking people,	873.75	1.447
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	"What's your rich life?
What do you wanna do?	875.197	1.853
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You wanna take a trip to Italy?	877.05	2.34
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You wanna take a quarterly camping trip?	879.39	2.25
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Awesome. Let's build
that into your rich life.	881.64	3.24
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Let's start there."	884.88	1.8
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	And once you do that,
suddenly you realize,	886.68	2.197
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	"Oh, my gosh. In order to do
these things that I wanna do,	888.877	4.133
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	whether it's solo or with a partner,	893.01	2.28
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	or bring my family and friends with me,	895.29	3.06
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	maybe I need to have more money."	898.35	2.61
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Now you have lots of ways to do it.	900.96	1.56
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You can negotiate your salary.
We've talked about that.	902.52	2.55
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	You can start a business. But
certainly, you can invest.	905.07	3.81
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	Every year you wait to invest
is costing you thousands,	908.88	5.0
GZ42PIi9bis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ42PIi9bis	sometimes tens of thousands of dollars.	914.13	1.8

c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	really bad year for the stock market in	5.64	3.84
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the last one year the Indian markets	7.799	4.141
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	have given roughly minus six percent	9.48	5.159

c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	sure that millions and millions of	18.96	3.72
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	retail investors would be sitting on a	20.64	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	loss if that is the case do press the	22.68	3.3

c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	more serious note here 2023 is turning	27.599	4.321
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	out to be a really bad year for the	30.18	4.379
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	stock market investors interestingly a	31.92	4.979
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	prediction was done roughly 150 years	34.559	5.34
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	back by an American Farmer who said that	36.899	5.401
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	you know what 2023 is going to be a bad	39.899	4.201
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	year for the stock market now I'll say	42.3	2.88
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Okay since when you have started	44.1	2.7
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	believing in all these predictions so no	45.18	3.42
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	this is a very interesting story so hear	46.8	3.599
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	me out for one minute it will help you	48.6	3.959
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	build that conviction as to why that	50.399	3.84
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	this year is probably one of the best	52.559	3.241
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	years to start your stock market	54.239	3.541
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	investment Journey so let me quickly	55.8	3.54
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	show the prediction and then I will	57.78	3.599
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	present a complete analysis around it so	59.34	3.539
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	here is the chart and I would encourage	61.379	3.721
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	you to take a look at it and observe	62.879	5.341
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	these Point A's so this here is 1927 so	65.1	4.62
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	this was during the Great Depression	68.22	3.24
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	time when the markets fell quite	69.72	4.74
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	aggressively then came 1945 which was	71.46	6.3
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the World War period Then in 1965 1970s	74.46	5.1
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	time there was high inflation problem in	77.76	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the U.S there was Vietnam War so lot of	79.56	4.02
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	bad Market sentiments were there then in	81.54	4.68
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	1980s again the U.S was facing a series	83.58	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	of inflation related problems and done	86.22	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	separate videos on that then in 1999 all	88.14	4.32
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	of us know that that was the.com bubble	90.6	4.199
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	era so 2019 was a slide off here because	92.46	3.6
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the correct prediction would have been	94.799	3.301
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	2020 that was the covet fall and then	96.06	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	more predictions are there for 2035 and	98.1	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	2053 so let me quickly take you through	100.32	3.9
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the chart and explain it so this point a	102.36	3.66
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	indicates the massive reason for the	104.22	3.6
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	fall and after this the market Falls	106.02	3.9
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	quite aggressively and the peak negative	107.82	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	sentiment happens at this point C so for	109.92	4.92
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	example if you consider 1927 then up	112.2	5.04
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	until 1931 the markets were really bad	114.84	4.8
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	then they started to go up similarly if	117.24	5.22
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	you can consider the 2000.com bubble	119.64	4.68
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	then the markets fell till what point	122.46	4.08
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the markets fell all the way till 2004	124.32	4.919
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	2005 and after that they started to rise	126.54	4.559
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	now you might say that okay I do not see	129.239	4.621
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	2008 that should have been there I agree	131.099	5.28
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that is a Miss by this model so to cut	133.86	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the long story short these predictions	136.379	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	were done in the year 1875 so you can	138.12	5.22
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	see it signed here and they have been	140.879	4.561
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	correct about a lot of events and the	143.34	4.14
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	hit rate is just phenomenal so comes the	145.44	3.48
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	question that okay why am I speaking	147.48	3.96
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	about this model in the year 2023 well	148.92	4.44
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	again let's go back to the model so this	151.44	4.32
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	is here 2023 and you can see that the	153.36	4.739
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	investment sentiment is at the lowest so	155.76	4.619
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	if you build positions in this year or	158.099	4.86
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	maybe even the next year and if there is	160.379	4.741
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	sustained bull run after that then as	162.959	4.14
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	per the model the next major major	165.12	4.619
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	crisis is going to happen in 2035. so	167.099	4.561
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	you are likely to benefit a lot so now	169.739	3.301
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	you might have another question that	171.66	3.18
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	okay can you explain how this model was	173.04	4.44
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	built and why is it so accurate and do	174.84	4.02
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	you believe in it so let me quickly	177.48	2.82
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	comment on that and then I I will	178.86	3.42
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	explain you a more refined model that	180.3	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	you can use in the year 2023 to make	182.28	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	stock Investments and then I will	184.86	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	discuss some specific stocks so okay so	186.54	3.54
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	going into the background of the model	188.64	3.48
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	this model was developed by a person	190.08	4.2
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	called as Samuel Banner so Samuel Banner	192.12	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	was a farmer back in the US and his	194.28	4.44
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	entire livelihood depended on doing	196.5	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	weather forecasting and whether the crop	198.72	3.96
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	will be good or bad when rain will	200.76	4.44
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	happen so he started observing the	202.68	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	prices of different crops So based on	205.2	3.36
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that he tried to predict the solar	206.94	2.82
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	cycles and a bunch of weather	208.56	3.3
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	forecasting around it and he reached an	209.76	4.32
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	eventual conclusion that roughly every	211.86	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	11 years there is likely to be a major	214.08	4.379
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	fall and therefore it is said even in	216.42	3.48
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the stock market that the stock market	218.459	4.081
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Falls once quite aggressively every 10	219.9	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	to 12 years so this model kind of	222.54	4.02
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	supports that hypothesis so it's not as	224.4	4.14
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	if that some random person came up and	226.56	4.02
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	they just willingly painted a picture	228.54	4.14
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	and stamped it and the model has been	230.58	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	working great no so there was little bit	232.68	3.54
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	of science that was going behind it no	234.36	3.42
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	doubt about that so this brings me to	236.22	3.54
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the second part that do I actually agree	237.78	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	with this commodity driven model in the	239.76	4.74
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	year 2023 the short answer is no and	242.04	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	this reminds me of the story of a	244.5	3.72
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	octopus called as Paul the octopus	246.54	3.3
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	people who love football would know	248.22	3.54
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	about Paul the octopus he was a very	249.84	4.14
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	famous octopus who used to predict the	251.76	4.02
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	next winner of the World Cup and this is	253.98	3.24
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	how he used to do it so it's a	255.78	3.299
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	fascinating story and if you look at the	257.22	3.66
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	hit rate with the accuracy with which	259.079	3.721
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Paul the octopus predicted the football	260.88	4.02
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	World Cup winners it came out to be	262.8	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	whopping 86 so yes of course he was	264.9	4.739
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	wrong once in a while but majority of	267.36	3.96
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	his model was right but if you ask me	269.639	3.541
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that okay can I prove the science behind	271.32	4.14
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	or give some logical explanation how an	273.18	4.079
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	octopus was able to predict World Cup	275.46	3.42
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	winners I would not have an answer but	277.259	3.901
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	here when it comes to Banner model is	278.88	4.14
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that backed by sign so the short answer	281.16	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	is yes but it is not completely backed	283.02	4.8
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	by economics and that is the explanation	285.54	4.439
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that I am going to present now that what	287.82	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	economic angle is missing from it and if	289.979	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	you include that then can you come up	292.38	4.02
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	with a better prediction model so there	294.479	3.481
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	are three specific points that you need	296.4	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	to know so first and foremost the model	297.96	4.739
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	as I previously explained was based on	300.18	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	commodity prices now these were prices	302.699	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	of food grains this was prices of metals	304.68	4.76
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	around it so back in the day especially	307.199	4.741
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	pre-1990s there was less usage of	309.44	4.42
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	internet technology and there was much	311.94	4.44
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	more contribution of Agriculture to the	313.86	5.279
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	entire GDP so this model fairly	316.38	4.74
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	correlated so to say with the economic	319.139	3.84
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	outcomes so let me show you this chart	321.12	4.019
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	and this comes from World Bank data and	322.979	4.201
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	you will categorically see that right	325.139	5.34
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	from the year 1970 all the way up until	327.18	5.94
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	now the contribution or percentage	330.479	5.16
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	contribution of GDP from Agriculture and	333.12	5.28
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Fisheries has been on a constant Decline	335.639	5.101
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	and more the contribution of Agriculture	338.4	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	shrinks the more noise this model is	340.74	4.019
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	going to create and less accurate it	342.9	3.54
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	will be the second key point that you	344.759	3.301
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	need to know in order to refine this	346.44	3.66
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	model is that the contribution of tech	348.06	4.8
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	has massively grown since the year 2000	350.1	4.8
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	right so if you consider internet-based	352.86	3.54
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	companies they started gaining more	354.9	4.139
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	prominence after the year 2000 once	356.4	6.54
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the.com burst was over 2008 was also a	359.039	5.88
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	pivotal year in the history of money and	362.94	4.02
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	I'll explain it in point three but the	364.919	3.241
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	second point that we need to understand	366.96	3.72
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	very clearly is that the contribution of	368.16	4.979
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	tech over time has been increasing and	370.68	4.2
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the last two and a half decades have	373.139	4.141
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	been a game changer in defining how the	374.88	4.14
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	businesses are built consider for	377.28	3.359
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	example the acquisition of Instagram	379.02	5.04
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Instagram was acquired in the year 2012	380.639	5.821
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	for 1 billion dollars and back in the	384.06	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	day if you go and read the newspapers or	386.46	3.9
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	online articles you will categorically	388.56	3.66
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	see that people were criticizing Mark	390.36	3.66
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Zuckerberg like anything that you know	392.22	3.479
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	what why would you pay like one billion	394.02	4.019
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	dollar for a 13-member team company and	395.699	4.201
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Instagram right now is one of the major	398.039	3.72
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Money Maker for the parent group company	399.9	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	which is now called as meta now going	401.759	4.261
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	forward it is very very likely that with	403.68	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the artificial intelligence chart GPT	406.02	3.66
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	type of tools machine learning tools	407.94	3.72
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	defy tools what is going to happen is	409.68	3.84
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that more and more contribution of Tech	411.66	4.379
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	2 GDP will happen and lesser and lesser	413.52	5.22
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the percentage of Agriculture to the GDP	416.039	4.321
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	growth will be attained so this brings	418.74	3.899
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	me to the third part and the story as to	420.36	3.899
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	why that previous model could not	422.639	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	capture the 2008 crisis the reason was	424.259	4.981
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	very simple that after the.com Bubble	427.199	4.081
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Burst the governments all across the	429.24	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	globe they started thinking of creative	431.28	4.979
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	ways of dealing with troubles 2008 was	433.02	5.1
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that watershed moment when the	436.259	3.901
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	government had no other option but to	438.12	4.32
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	start the race for money printing in	440.16	5.46
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	2008 was that pivotal year when money in	442.44	4.8
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	a way became fake now what do I mean	445.62	3.66
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that money became fake in order to	447.24	3.66
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	understand that you need to understand	449.28	4.919
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the concept of M1 money now M1 money in	450.9	4.859
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	very simple easy to understand language	454.199	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	means that this is the free float of the	455.759	3.961
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	money that is available which is highly	457.979	3.84
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	liquid now let me show you two graphics	459.72	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	and you tell me whether you think that	461.819	3.481
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	there is something off here or not so	463.5	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	this is the supply of M1 money in India	465.3	4.619
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	and you can categorically see that this	468.0	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	used to be the trend line for M1 money	469.919	4.741
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	then it changed and then it almost	471.78	4.979
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	became exponential so this is trend line	474.66	3.84
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	one this is trend line two this is trend	476.759	3.601
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	line three now let me show you another	478.5	3.9
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	funny picture which is the same data but	480.36	3.899
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	for the US market so here you can see	482.4	4.019
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that this is trend line and then it	484.259	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	almost went exponential now anything be	486.419	3.84
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	it a stock price if it is going	488.819	3.66
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	exponential in this literal way then the	490.259	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	chances are that it is going to fall	492.479	3.901
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	quite aggressively and that is precisely	494.039	4.921
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	what is likely to happen next as per my	496.38	4.92
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	understanding of Economics so in 2023	498.96	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	from a market point of view as things	501.3	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	stand what is likely to happen going	503.52	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	forward and then I will start discussing	505.68	3.72
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	specific stocks what is likely to happen	507.3	4.619
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	is one major macroeconomic change and	509.4	4.559
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that is the division between the rich	511.919	5.101
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	and poor so far our society can be	513.959	5.101
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	somewhat divided into three spheres one	517.02	4.199
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	would be rich Ultra Rich category second	519.06	4.08
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	would be poor and in the middle you have	521.219	3.721
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	a middle class I have made enough videos	523.14	3.3
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	on the same topic where I have	524.94	3.54
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	categorically come out and said that you	526.44	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	know what going forward the world is	528.48	3.419
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	going to get divided in literally two	530.22	4.08
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	one would be ultra Elite Rich the other	531.899	4.681
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	would be poor the fraction in group a	534.3	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Ultra Elite rich and rich people they	536.58	3.9
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	are going to be a fraction and majority	538.8	3.42
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	of the people living in the world will	540.48	3.84
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	fall in that lower category so the big	542.22	3.84
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	middle class that we keep talking about	544.32	3.0
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that you know what there will be	546.06	3.48
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	migration of middle class to Rich class	547.32	4.079
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	well more migration is going to happen	549.54	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	from middle class to poorer class why is	551.399	4.201
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that the case again I'll make some kind	553.92	3.539
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	of an updated video on that but the	555.6	3.6
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	reason why I'm saying that and it can be	557.459	3.841
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	seen from the way the companies are	559.2	3.9
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	functioning now you would have seen that	561.3	4.74
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	in the year 2022 Mercedes did record	563.1	5.28
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	number of sales in India Lamborghini was	566.04	4.08
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	sold out real estate projects have been	568.38	4.32
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	sold out so these are hyper-rich class	570.12	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	people and they are only getting richer	572.7	3.6
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	with time on the flip side if you	574.5	3.899
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	consider the average income in India	576.3	4.979
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	right now it comes out to be 24 to 25	578.399	4.741
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	000 rupees and you tell me that if you	581.279	4.261
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	are making 24 25 000 rupees would you	583.14	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	consider yourself to be middle class or	585.54	4.14
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	would you consider to be in that poorer	587.7	4.139
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	segment so like it or not our world is	589.68	4.02
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	getting divided into these two segments	591.839	4.081
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	it's a very important demographic change	593.7	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that we need to understand why is that	595.92	4.32
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the case because it is going to shape up	598.2	4.02
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	our investment decisions so this brings	600.24	3.599

c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	video where I will start speaking about	603.839	4.081
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	specific stocks and what type of stocks	605.519	4.621

c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	startup so these would be companies that	646.26	3.84

c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	long story short what is going to happen	656.94	3.78
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	in the world going for forward is that I	658.62	4.38

c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	businesses so for this you need to study	669.66	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the VC or Venture Capital model if you	671.76	4.68

c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	entire ecosystem is somewhat drying up	694.32	4.74
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	it has become evidently clear that even	696.72	4.799
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	VCS want their portfolio companies like	699.06	4.86

c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	year of profitability that has somewhat	741.42	3.659
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	been crafted please don't run after that	743.22	3.6
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	study the business model fundamentally	745.079	3.481
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	this is where I'll stop on the first	746.82	3.72
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	investment side that generally avoid	748.56	4.2
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	these type of Investments second what	750.54	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	type of Investments am I making so I am	752.76	4.199
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	trying to make investments that give me	755.1	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	inflation protection why is this the	756.959	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	case the reason is very simple that the	759.36	4.62
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	inflation in the world will remain high	761.519	4.081
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that is not coming down the interest	763.98	3.299
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	rates might be brought down then they	765.6	3.479
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	might be increased again then might be	767.279	3.841
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	brought down again all that drama will	769.079	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	keep on happening but we have moved to a	771.12	3.899
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	world where inflation will remain high	773.339	4.141
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	why is that the case again going back to	775.019	4.62
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that increased money supply or M1 money	777.48	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	supply that needs to be brought down	779.639	3.901
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	when the money supply is really really	781.74	4.44
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	high the inflation will stay high so we	783.54	4.56
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	are definitely looking at a period of 10	786.18	4.8
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	year of very very high inflation and the	788.1	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	type of stocks that are likely to	790.98	4.2
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	survive are the ones that have a pricing	792.6	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	power so let me give you two examples	795.18	4.44
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	there one is Hindustan Unilever that's a	796.98	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	company that can keep on increasing its	799.62	3.959
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	price but people will still buy the	801.48	4.02
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	product how do I know it again please go	803.579	3.841
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	and check the last two year data and	805.5	3.779
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	look at the price increases that hul	807.42	4.44
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	products have undergone second example	809.279	4.381
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	here would be something like apple that	811.86	4.14
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	it is able to increase its prices at its	813.66	4.08
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	will and people still continue to buy	816.0	3.24
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Apple products so these type of	817.74	3.599
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	companies are going to do well over the	819.24	4.2
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	next 10 years and I'm aggregating as	821.339	4.8
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	much as possible the third key type are	823.44	4.74
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the tech stocks so if you can find	826.139	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	really good tech stocks you can directly	828.18	4.44
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	build position that's a second the	830.399	4.321
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	market is overall down so if you do not	832.62	3.839
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	know about tech stocks and if you just	834.72	3.96
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	generally want to widen your bets then	836.459	3.781
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	you can definitely consider something	838.68	4.08
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	like itbs so this way you are betting on	840.24	4.92
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the entire it Market in India similarly	842.76	4.62
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	you can simply go and buy NASDAQ in the	845.16	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	US again that becomes a viable option	847.38	4.32
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	then comes the third investable option	849.66	4.08
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	which according to me are companies like	851.7	4.379
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	PD light for example which have some	853.74	4.14
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	kind of manufacturing mode so what is	856.079	3.301
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	the meaning of manufacturing mode in	857.88	3.12
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	very easy to understand terms for	859.38	3.48
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	example if I try to compete with PD	861.0	3.959
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	light and if I'm setting up my own	862.86	4.74
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	manufacturing Factory I am able to	864.959	4.62
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	produce one Ferry goal at 100 rupees or	867.6	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	one adhesive under my brand 100 rupees	869.579	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	but PD light since it has that supply	871.86	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	chain has that branding power all that	873.959	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	stuff going for it it will be able to	876.24	4.5
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	produce that same unit at 80 rupees same	878.339	3.961
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	goes for something like Asian paints	880.74	3.36
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	that there is no reason why Asian paints	882.3	3.899
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	will be producing a bucket of paint at a	884.1	3.9
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	higher price compared to any other paint	886.199	3.721
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	or home decor farm so these two become	888.0	4.32
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	your investable option then come Fifth	889.92	4.26
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	and finally that if you do not know much	892.32	3.9
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	and if you want to build position in the	894.18	4.38
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	Indian market then Indian banks are very	896.22	4.619
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	very good they have the test of time so	898.56	4.32
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	to say one of the Prime reason was that	900.839	3.601
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	a lot of Bank cleanup had already	902.88	3.84
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	happened so with specific Banks to buy	904.44	4.259
c_q3tyrQ6MA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q3tyrQ6MA	with specific Banks you should not buy	906.72	3.9

9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	you need to quickly understand the	71.58	3.96
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	operating model of Silicon Valley bank	73.26	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	now basically this is a bank for	75.54	4.98
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	startups they get VC funding so VC funds	77.82	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	are what VC funds are these big big	80.52	3.36
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	players for example Gary tan runs a	81.96	4.08
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	company called as Y combinator and these	83.88	4.62
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	are large investors who give their money	86.04	4.439
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	to these early State startups and then	88.5	3.96
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	these companies take on money and they	90.479	3.841
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	grow but many a times what these	92.46	3.9
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	companies do is that for example Ola	94.32	3.36
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	let's say it's received a funding of	96.36	3.66
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	1000 crore then some amount of this	97.68	4.2
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	money they will consume immediately in	100.02	3.3
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	terms of hiring building operations	101.88	4.98
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	testing products and a large part of it	103.32	6.0
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	would be stuck or kept in a bank now	106.86	5.16
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	many of these startups or rather 50 of	109.32	5.1
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	these startups which is in U.S tech and	112.02	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	life science used to give their money to	114.42	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Silicon Valley Bank so just to cut the	116.52	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	long story short silicon Ali Bank used	118.74	4.68
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	to primarily cater to the startups now	121.02	4.68
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	any bank has two primary functions one	123.42	4.08
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is that they take money from depositors	125.7	3.899
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	like us for example if you consider the	127.5	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	banking model of HDFC Bank how does the	129.599	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	bank make money they will take our money	132.0	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	for example I will go and deposit let's	134.099	5.161
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	say 5000 rupees in HDFC bank now since I	136.14	5.64
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	have given my money to HDFC Bank HDFC	139.26	4.8
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	bank will give me a rate of interest on	141.78	4.26
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	that loan at let's say three percent or	144.06	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	two percent on savings account now the	146.04	3.9
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	bank will take that money and further	148.2	3.539
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	loan it out to different parties in	149.94	3.36
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	terms of giving business loans in terms	151.739	4.261
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	of giving housing loans etc etc and in	153.3	3.9
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the middle they will make a certain	156.0	2.94
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	spread for example these days the	157.2	4.02
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	housing loan rates are roughly 10 and	158.94	4.079
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	how much money am I getting on my	161.22	3.78
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	deposits on savings account of HDFC bank	163.019	3.72
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	I am primarily getting around let's say	165.0	3.36
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	three or four percent now six percent	166.739	4.201
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	becomes the spread of its DFC bank now	168.36	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	in SBB bank's perspective what was	170.94	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	happening was that they did not have any	172.92	5.22
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	deposit or bad loan problem per se now	175.08	4.739
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	what is the meaning of this for example	178.14	4.8
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	many of these startups Ola Uber etc etc	179.819	5.28
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	they were giving their money to Silicon	182.94	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Valley Bank they did not have a deposit	185.099	4.561
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	problem but on the flip side not too	187.5	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	many organizations especially startups	189.66	4.439
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	were borrowing money why was this the	192.06	3.78
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	case for this to understand you need to	194.099	3.72
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	check the interest rates and at what	195.84	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	scale they have been escalating so right	197.819	4.321
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	now in the US the rate of interest is	199.98	3.899
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	roughly five percent that is the Fed	202.14	3.959
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	rate so the business loans could go all	203.879	4.021
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the way up to seven eight percent also	206.099	3.901
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	which is fairly high in the U.S economy	207.9	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	so as a result first and foremost the	210.0	3.959
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Silicon Valley Bank was facing an	212.22	3.54
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	operational problem there was another	213.959	3.721
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	problem that was brewing up and it was	215.76	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the withdrawal problem so again going	217.68	3.96
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	back to our model that I was earlier	220.08	3.719
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	explaining so all these startups imagine	221.64	5.159
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	that Ola has 100 million dollars stuck	223.799	5.341
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	with Silicon Valley bank now what is	226.799	3.901
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	happening in the market is that because	229.14	3.78
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the interest rates are fairly high so	230.7	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Ola might not be taking any new loan	232.92	4.739
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	that's one second many of the new Aid	235.08	4.2
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	startups that were planning their IPOs	237.659	3.841
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	for example in India we had baijus we	239.28	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	had mama and a bunch of other startups	241.5	4.08
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	which are like unicorn level startups	243.84	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	they have also postponed their IPO plans	245.58	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	so again they are not getting any new	248.22	3.54
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	money so what these startups started	250.14	3.06
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	doing was that they thought that hey you	251.76	3.479
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	know what we have cash lying around so	253.2	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	we will go and withdraw this money from	255.239	4.74
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Silicon Valley Bank and use it to fund	257.34	4.679
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	our operation in this interest rate	259.979	4.44
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	environment where the cost of capital or	262.019	4.68
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the cost of borrowing is becoming very	264.419	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	high so Silicon Valley Bank was unable	266.699	4.741
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	to give out new loans second the rate of	268.919	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	cash withdrawals accelerated and a lot	271.44	3.96
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	of parties started asking for their	273.479	4.021
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	money back and third and finally what	275.4	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	accelerated this crisis was bad	277.5	4.44
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	investments from Silicon Valley Bank's	279.78	4.26
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	behalf so for that let me take you to	281.94	3.9
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the balance sheet of Silicon Valley Bank	284.04	3.84
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	and explain this point by using some	285.84	4.139
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	numbers facts and figures so this is the	287.88	3.599
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	group's balance sheet and what you would	289.979	2.701
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	notice is that they have something	291.479	3.361
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	called as held to maturity Securities	292.68	4.739
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	and you would also notice that the total	294.84	4.859
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Quantum of these Securities is roughly 9	297.419	5.041
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	21 billion dollars now if you notice	299.699	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	this particular sentence it is fairly	302.46	3.6
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	interesting that they have written fair	304.259	4.621
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	value of 76 billion dollars so roughly	306.06	5.46
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	there is a loss of 15 billion on this	308.88	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	security now this is a slightly	311.52	4.08
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	technical Finance concept so let me take	313.38	4.08
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	a minute to explain this that what is	315.6	3.48
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the meaning of helical maturity	317.46	3.66
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Securities now basically held till	319.08	4.26
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	maturity type of Securities are a bond	321.12	4.139
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	now bond is simply a promise that is	323.34	3.84
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	made between two parties so basically	325.259	4.141
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	when you do a fixed deposit it is a type	327.18	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	of a bond for example you are going and	329.4	4.2
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	depositing 1 lakh rupee today in HDFC	331.32	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	bank and it is saying that we are going	333.6	3.84
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	to pay you seven and a half percent rate	335.88	3.84
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	of interest on your fixed deposit if you	337.44	4.08
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	do a fixed deposit of let's say two	339.72	4.02
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	years so that is a type of a contract	341.52	4.92
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	between you and a bank so HTM Securities	343.74	4.98
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	are also like that now Silicon Valley	346.44	4.62
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Bank was getting a lot of deposits from	348.72	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	its customers so for example let's	351.06	3.96
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	assume that it got 150 billion dollars	352.86	4.26
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	of customers deposit now what is it	355.02	3.78
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	going to do with that it typically would	357.12	4.079
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	go and put it try to put it in safe	358.8	4.8
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	investment instruments like hell little	361.199	4.621
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	maturity Securities now the way these	363.6	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Securities work that they are bought at	365.82	4.2
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	a discount and then they mature at the	368.1	4.2
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	face value for example the bank will get	370.02	5.22
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	to buy these Securities at 98 and after	372.3	6.42
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	30 years they might mature at 100 or 105	375.24	5.16
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	dollars depending on whatever the	378.72	3.84
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	contract says now the type of maturities	380.4	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	that Silicon Valley Bank procured was	382.56	5.16
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	30-year Securities now what it typically	384.9	4.2
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	said was that you know what we are	387.72	3.599
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	buying these Securities at 98 and I'm	389.1	4.319
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	just using it as an example we will hold	391.319	4.44
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	it for 30 years and then we are going to	393.419	6.06
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	make 105 or 100 on it so that is how	395.759	6.0
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	this instrument was designed now the	399.479	4.381
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	health maturity securities also have a	401.759	4.621
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	functionality that in case the party who	403.86	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is holding these Securities need to sell	406.38	4.379
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	it and Avail that money immediately then	408.18	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	they can go to the secondary market and	410.759	3.901
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	sell it at whatever the existing price	412.68	4.26
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is now the interesting bit is that	414.66	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	whenever the interest rates in the	416.94	4.44
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	economy rise the price of the bonds	418.8	4.44
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	decrease so I hope that you understood	421.38	4.08
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	this complicated concept as to why the	423.24	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	value of these healthil maturity	425.46	4.26
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Security on the balance sheet was 91	427.56	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	billion dollars but as of today its	429.72	4.8
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	value was 76 billion dollar and the bank	432.06	5.04
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	was having a notional loss of 15 billion	434.52	5.1
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	dollars now if the bank's balance sheet	437.1	4.319
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is really strong then absorbing this	439.62	4.199
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	loss of 15 billion dollars is not that	441.419	4.921
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	big a deal but if you go and analyze the	443.819	3.901
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	balance sheet further what you will	446.34	3.66
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	notice is that the value of total Equity	447.72	4.62
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	comes out to be roughly 16 billion	450.0	4.8
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	dollars now the loss that the bank is	452.34	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	having is 15 billion dollars and total	454.8	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	outstanding Equity value is roughly 15	456.84	4.919
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	16 billion dollars now in the event of	459.12	4.799
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	any other additional default this bank	461.759	4.681
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is likely to collapse so that is the	463.919	4.861
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	specific reason why this Bank collapsed	466.44	3.96
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	like a house of card and The Regulators	468.78	3.359
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	had to step in so now comes the natural	470.4	3.78
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	question that why the bank had to book a	472.139	4.321
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	loss of 15 billion dollar in terms of	474.18	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	selling these Securities because if they	476.46	4.139
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	would have simply held on to these bonds	478.68	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	and waited till maturity they would have	480.599	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	recovered this entire price because that	483.06	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is how the bond functions well the	484.979	4.321
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	answer again there lies in the form of	487.38	3.9
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	bank run that was happening that the	489.3	3.66
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	startups required money a lot of	491.28	3.359
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	startups were withdrawing the cash from	492.96	3.9
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	them some startups looked at the balance	494.639	4.081
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	sheet that I just showed you and figured	496.86	3.36
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	out that you know what this bank is	498.72	3.24
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	sitting on barood so let us withdraw our	500.22	3.78
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	cash quickly now another panic was	501.96	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	created by Peter Thiel Gary tan and all	504.0	4.8
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the prominent VC investors who are	506.28	3.96
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	highly respected in the startup	508.8	3.299
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	ecosystem Community one of these	510.24	3.419
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	investors advised their portfolio	512.099	3.24
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	company that hey you know what this bank	513.659	3.661
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is likely to go under withdraw your	515.339	3.901
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	money and that just created massive	517.32	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	panic and the bank in order to create	519.24	4.679
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	that additional liquidity had to sell	521.64	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	these assets at a massive loss so now	523.919	3.781
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	comes the second most critical question	526.14	3.54
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	that okay fine Silicon Valley Bank has	527.7	4.319
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	gone under now Regulators are going to	529.68	4.2
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	do whatever they are going to do but is	532.019	3.781
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	it going to have a larger impact on the	533.88	4.079
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	U.S market and more specifically the	535.8	3.719
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Indian market so in order to understand	537.959	3.661
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	stand that how this Silicon Valley Bank	539.519	4.561
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	crisis is going to impact the other bank	541.62	4.68
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	you need to again go back to the Genesis	544.08	3.72
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	of the crisis and therefore and	546.3	3.12
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	explained you everything fundamentally	547.8	4.2
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	and this chart is fairly important now	549.42	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	if you look at the Hilton maturity	552.0	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Securities for other prominent U.S Bank	553.8	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	if you consider JP Morgan Morgan Stanley	556.14	4.259
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	all the major major banks that are there	558.3	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	in the US what you will notice is that	560.399	5.581
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	there is unrealized losses on investment	562.68	5.46
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Securities currently with these Banks	565.98	4.62
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	and this amounts in billions of dollars	568.14	4.98
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	for example right now these banks are	570.6	5.12
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	setting of unrealized losses of roughly	573.12	5.52
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	670 billion dollars this is a fairly	575.72	5.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	large figure but again please go back to	578.64	4.199
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the section that I was explaining that	581.04	3.9
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	if you simply hold on to your whole	582.839	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	detail maturity Securities these	584.94	4.62
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	unrealized losses are not going to hit	587.399	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	your balance sheet these are safer	589.56	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Securities there is no issue there but	591.899	4.261
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	in case of Silicon Valley Bank they had	594.06	4.02
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	no other option but to sell their	596.16	4.26
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Securities these other a big Banks meet	598.08	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	JP Morgan Morgan Stanley at least from	600.42	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the look at the data it doesn't appear	602.64	3.66
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	that they are facing any kind of	604.8	3.96
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	liquidity Crunch and they don't have to	606.3	4.74
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	book losses here it is like me saying	608.76	5.04
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	that you purchased nifty 50 at 18 500	611.04	6.0
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	levels right now the Nifty is at 17 300	613.8	5.28
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	400 levels you are sitting on a little	617.04	4.08
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	bit of loss but is that real loss the	619.08	4.199
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	answer is no it is notional loss and it	621.12	4.02
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is very very likely that nifty 50 is	623.279	4.62
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	going to go back to 18500 and here we	625.14	4.259
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	are talking about the stock market which	627.899	4.321
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is risky but in HTM Securities these are	629.399	4.741
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	usually safe Securities and if you hold	632.22	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	them till maturity then your unrealized	634.14	4.379
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	losses will go away because these	636.6	4.08
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	unrealized losses are marked to Market	638.519	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	on the secondary market so these Banks	640.68	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	do not necessarily need to sell it right	642.839	3.601
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	now so now you might have another	644.82	3.84
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	natural question KR in 2008 also	646.44	4.079
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	something similar happened that because	648.66	4.2
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	lemon Brothers collabs then other Banks	650.519	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	collapsed with it so let me explain that	652.86	4.68
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	point also so in the 2008 crisis there	654.839	4.56
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	was something called a subprime loan so	657.54	3.96
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	so these were packaged as investment	659.399	4.081
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	grade instruments and not only lemon	661.5	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Brothers had access to that but a wide	663.48	4.68
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	range of banks had access to that in the	665.88	3.959
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	current situation that we are analyzing	668.16	3.419
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	these are whole little maturity	669.839	3.601
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	Securities these are safe assets	671.579	4.681
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	subprime loans were unsafe assets so	673.44	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	please understand the concept of	676.26	4.199
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	underlying that in 2008 crisis the	677.76	4.92
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	underlying was really bad to begin with	680.459	5.06
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	those were subprime loans	682.68	5.64
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	here the hotel maturity Securities	685.519	5.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	underlying structure is strong enough it	688.32	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is just a credit crunch that the bank	690.839	4.201
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	suffered and as a result a lot of	692.82	3.959
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	customers ran to the bank to withdraw	695.04	3.72
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	their money and that led to a bank run	696.779	3.901
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	situation so this brings us to the third	698.76	3.72
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	and final section as to what would be	700.68	3.36
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the impact on the Indian stock market	702.48	3.9
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	and the U.S stock market so let me start	704.04	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	with the U.S stock market I feel that	706.38	3.78
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	this is a Sentimental issue first and	708.54	4.02
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	foremost so a lot of U.S banks will	710.16	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	continue to suffer for a little bit it	712.56	3.779
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is not a fundamental issue it is likely	714.48	3.78
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	to get solved and therefore I'll be	716.339	3.901
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	purchasing some of the USB fact also	718.26	3.66
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	which ones I will let you know in the	720.24	3.839
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	YouTube member Community but I feel that	721.92	4.02
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	due to the knee-jerk reaction and people	724.079	3.601
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	not understanding The Basics around it	725.94	4.079
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	there will be a panic-like situation for	727.68	4.86
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the next few days this is part A Part B	730.019	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is that it is very likely that some kind	732.54	3.66
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	of restructuring might happen in the	734.519	3.301
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	bank itself and the bank will be	736.2	3.78
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	supported by Regulators now comes the	737.82	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	discussion on the Indian stock market so	739.98	3.84
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	is the Indian stock market likely to	742.2	3.54
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	fall now short term I can't predict most	743.82	3.78
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	likely it is going to fall why because	745.74	3.599
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	again people would not understand the	747.6	3.54
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	fundamentals people will go by the	749.339	3.421
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	emotional triggers that are being pulled	751.14	3.66
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	and this is a complex situation to	752.76	4.579
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	understand because	754.8	2.539
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	and people just blow up the news and try	758.24	4.779
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	to create a panic now comes the second	760.92	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	part of the impact and the actual impact	763.019	4.201
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	that might happen according to me and	765.3	3.599
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	this commentary comes from Gary tan I've	767.22	3.119
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	shown you earlier so I'll show it to you	768.899	3.481
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	again he has called it an extension	770.339	4.44
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	level event but extension level for whom	772.38	4.44
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	for the startups for the bank for the	774.779	3.721
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	stock market so you need to Define that	776.82	3.54
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	so I feel that this is an extinction	778.5	3.779
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	level event for some of these startups	780.36	3.84
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	for short so in this Silicon Valley Bank	782.279	3.781
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	you show the money of the depositors	784.2	3.66
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	which is the startup is going to get	786.06	3.839
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	stuck for a little bit of time for sure	787.86	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	so if let's say for the next six months	789.899	4.021
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	till the time entire restructuring is	792.18	4.26
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	done the bank is recapitalized or some	793.92	4.26
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	solution is being built how to return	796.44	4.5
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	money to the depositors the startups who	798.18	4.74
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	are struggling financially they will be	800.94	3.72
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	unable to pay the salary of the	802.92	3.479
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	employees and what do you think is going	804.66	3.299
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	to happen to those employees are they	806.399	2.88
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	going to work for free the answer is no	807.959	2.701
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	they are not going to work for free they	809.279	3.0
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	are most likely going to join some other	810.66	3.9
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	company and then there will be a host of	812.279	3.841
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	challenges that these startups might	814.56	3.719
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	face so this startup funding winter is	816.12	4.14
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	likely to continue for a lot of startups	818.279	3.421
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	I don't know I haven't studied the	820.26	2.579
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	internal balance sheet of different	821.7	3.12
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	startups and neither can I comment on	822.839	3.901
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	the veracity of this but to my	824.82	4.199
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	understanding when Gary tan quoted the	826.74	4.86
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	extinction level event scenario it was	829.019	4.38
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	mostly pertaining to startups not	831.6	3.66
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	necessarily the stock market and going	833.399	3.601
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	forward I am very much hopeful and my	835.26	3.24
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	bullishness regarding the stock market	837.0	4.139
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	continues to be yes there is a very high	838.5	4.32
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	likelihood that in the short term these	841.139	3.541
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	stock markets might correct and the	842.82	3.72
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	sideways movement might continue for a	844.68	3.959
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	few more months but I am overall bullish	846.54	4.08
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	and I feel that the world is resilient	848.639	4.081
9U4wRZ7y7lI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U4wRZ7y7lI	enough in order to overcome these type	850.62	3.719

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	let me ask you a very interesting	2.159	4.62
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	question that back in 2016 what was your	3.36	5.279
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	mobile phone bill the answer would be	6.779	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	close to 0 because Reliance you had	8.639	4.021
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	recently launched and all of us were	10.679	3.601
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	enjoying that freebie that you are	12.66	3.6
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	getting from Reliance but over the years	14.28	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Reliance started hiking its price and	16.26	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	tariff plans and just last year they	18.42	5.519
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	have increased their tariffs by 21 so	20.76	4.859
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	now quote me what your mobile monthly	23.939	4.321
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	bill is it would be a lot now my	25.619	4.261
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	prediction is that going forward people	28.26	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	like you and I are going to pay crazy	29.88	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	amount of money in terms of the fuel	32.46	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	charges in terms of logistics or	34.44	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	transportation in terms of electricity	36.42	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	bill in terms of flight payments now why	38.34	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is that happening it is happening	40.92	3.12
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	because of Russia's model now what	42.36	3.6
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Russia has to do with it so for that you	44.04	3.6
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	need to understand the backstory and	45.96	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	there is a very important macroeconomic	47.64	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	concept that I will tell you as to how	49.44	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Monopoly businesses distort the living	51.36	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	standards for middle class people and	53.82	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	lower middle class people so to kick	55.62	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	start that story try answering this	57.48	4.259
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	question who do you think is the richest	59.46	5.04
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	person on Earth some would say Elon Musk	61.739	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	some would say Bill Gates some would say	64.5	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Warren Buffett all are wrong answers the	66.299	4.981
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	richest person on earth is Mr Vladimir	68.7	4.98
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Putin his estimated unofficial net worth	71.28	4.92
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is somewhere around 200 billion dollars	73.68	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	now that is not even the interesting	76.2	3.959
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	part now the interesting part is that if	78.0	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you pick the Apex politician in Russia	80.159	4.561
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	he or she would hold this title of being	82.32	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the richest person on Earth unofficially	84.72	4.439
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	speaking now comes the natural question	87.06	4.68
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that okay why is it the case so to cut	89.159	5.341
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the long story short back in 1991 when	91.74	5.04
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the disintegration of USSR took place	94.5	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and Russia was formed a lot of	96.78	3.839
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	government oriented businesses were	98.82	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	converted into private players or	100.619	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	private organizations and a lot of	102.6	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	businesses were given to these big	104.759	4.201
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	private players but unofficially the	106.56	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	politicians controlled the wealth of	108.96	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	these private players and therefore we	110.7	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are sitting in a world today in Russia	112.74	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	where 8 out of 10 of their top	114.6	4.979
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	businesses lie in the infrastructure or	116.82	4.92
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	oil and gas domain here is a complete	119.579	4.201

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	something very very similar is happening	123.78	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	in India and people are cheering for it	125.7	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	now I know a lot of people would have	128.16	3.12
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	disliked this video already because you	129.66	2.82
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	know what akshat you are trying to give	131.28	3.24
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	it a political color you run a finance	132.48	3.24
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Channel why are you speaking about	134.52	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	politics okay so let me make my stand	135.72	5.34
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	explicitly clear this entire Nexus of	138.06	5.399
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	business politician has been run by a	141.06	4.2

58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	let's kick start the video and we are	180.959	3.121
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	going to discuss the topic of	182.4	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	responsible monopolies and irresponsible	184.08	4.739
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	monopolies and what exactly are Monopoly	186.48	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	oriented businesses do we need them do	188.819	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	we not need them and how as a common	190.8	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	citizen you should think about this	192.72	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	entire spectrum and Viewpoint you will	194.34	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	understand a lot of Economics Finance	196.44	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	behind whatever I am speaking these type	198.3	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	of videos require a lot of research so	200.519	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	if you do like the content do consider	202.44	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	sharing so okay so let us have a very	204.659	3.541
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	quick conversation as to what is meant	206.22	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	by Monopoly businesses by understanding	208.2	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	two Central terms so the first key thing	210.48	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is that any Monopoly business for	212.58	3.299
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	example if you take a look at the	214.379	3.841
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airports in India there are only going	215.879	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to be limited number of airports once	218.22	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	our entire infrastructure is built now	220.379	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	if one company controls most of that	222.72	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airport it would be called as a very big	224.879	4.321
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	company in that space and one could	227.28	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	argue that it has become a monopoly in	229.2	4.259
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that particular industry now such	231.48	3.839
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	companies have created a very big	233.459	4.321
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	barrier to entry barrier to entry means	235.319	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that for example let's imagine that	237.78	3.179
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	there are only three 100 airports in	239.159	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	India that can eventually be built and	240.959	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	one of these companies control 200 such	242.879	4.381
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airports now can other people come and	244.86	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	create another airport in Delhi it is	247.26	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	very very unlikely because Delhi at Max	249.18	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	might have two airports or maybe three	250.98	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airports eventually in the next 50 60	252.72	4.799
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	years so from that perspective very high	255.06	4.859
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	barriers to entry have been created and	257.519	4.981
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	no new competition can come so now comes	259.919	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the natural question that you know what	262.5	3.3
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	does it mean that we should not give	263.759	4.681
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	private players an opportunity to become	265.8	4.92
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	these type of monopolies or is it okay	268.44	4.319
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	for government to hand over this type of	270.72	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	work to certain private players now this	272.759	4.081
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	becomes a highly debatable issue	275.28	3.6
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	sometimes it takes a nationalistic color	276.84	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	for example I get so much heat that you	278.88	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	know what you are speaking against adani	281.1	3.18
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	ji he's doing like such great work yes	282.66	3.36
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	yes he is doing amazing work I	284.28	3.359
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	completely respect it but please	286.02	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	understand that I am speaking from an	287.639	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	economics Viewpoint consider in this	289.44	4.259
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	simple example that out of 300 airports	291.54	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	hypothetically if 200 are controlled by	293.699	4.081
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	adaniji then what is going to happen to	295.74	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you and I as common citizen then it is	297.78	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	very very likely that like the Reliance	300.12	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	your story that they are now jacking up	302.04	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the prices for everything because there	303.9	3.12
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are hardly two three players left in the	305.46	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Telecom space similarly if one company	307.02	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	controls 200 airports you will pay more	309.24	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money for the burgers that you eat or	311.52	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the book that you buy or the taxes that	313.139	3.721
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you pay for taking your flights the	315.06	4.139
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	parking space that you procure etc etc	316.86	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	now you might have a natural response	319.199	2.821
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that if they increase their flight	320.94	2.88
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	ticket prices then I'll stop using the	322.02	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airlines altogether well very good now	323.82	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	can you travel from Kashmir to	325.919	3.481
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	kanyakumari in bus well maybe you can	327.36	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	maybe you can't but it will take a lot	329.4	4.019
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	of time and for a lot of people taking a	331.259	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	bus or a car is not feasible at all this	333.419	4.62
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is a highly important product that will	335.639	4.741
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	be used by people and it will not have a	338.039	4.741
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	very high elasticity of demand so I hope	340.38	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that you got the perspective and there	342.78	3.24
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is no clear line whether the government	344.46	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	should Outsource these Monopoly oriented	346.02	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	businesses to the private sector or not	348.6	4.319
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	but there has to be a certain oversight	350.58	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and you tell me whether this is being	352.919	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	done in a responsible way again not	354.479	4.141
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	targeting any particular party this has	356.759	3.361
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	been done by a bunch of different	358.62	3.419
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	political parties so I will just leave	360.12	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that conversation there so now comes the	362.039	3.421
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	second point that even if you assume	363.78	3.06
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that you know what government cannot be	365.46	3.179
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	everywhere it cannot manage like ports	366.84	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	it cannot run like power companies it	368.639	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	cannot do like 500 different things it	370.38	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	has to bring in private players so then	372.6	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	there is a difference between creating	374.82	4.379
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	responsible monopolies and irresponsible	376.44	4.86
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	monopolies now this is a tweet that I've	379.199	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	done and I will name the groups directly	381.3	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	so I compared the Tata group with adani	383.039	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	group and look at the hate that I got I	385.08	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	just simply presented facts and the fact	386.94	5.28
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	was that it will take 16.4 years for	388.979	6.0
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	adanis to repay their debt and it will	392.22	5.22
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	only take 1.5 years for the Tata group	394.979	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to repay their debt now you'll say that	397.44	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	okay how did you get this number can you	399.539	3.421
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	show some math behind it absolutely here	401.1	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is the math behind it and this is called	402.96	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	as cash flow to debt ratio and you can	404.52	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	see that for the adani group and these	406.86	3.839
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	numbers are from September so now the	408.78	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	situation will be even more worse so the	410.699	3.381
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	total group was	412.74	5.1
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	936.6 and here it was 1216.6 billion	414.08	6.339
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	rupees so if you take a look at their	417.84	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	free cash flow so free cash flow simply	420.419	2.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	means	422.1	3.18
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	right I mean how much money they are	423.199	4.0
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	eventually getting so from that simple	425.28	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	perspective if you do this entire	427.199	4.861
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	analysis you get this repayment time so	429.0	5.1
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that is how you reach a number that if	432.06	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you compare it to the Tata group they	434.1	3.599
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are also creating certain monopolies in	435.84	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	certain industries for example Tata salt	437.699	3.661
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	could be considered as a monopoly	439.68	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	similarly they control a lot of power	441.36	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	business etc etc but the point is that	443.16	4.979
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the Tata group has grown sensibly and	445.86	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	organically or to a very large extent	448.139	4.321
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	organically there has not been a	450.12	4.859
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	dramatic Rise by taking on public debt	452.46	3.6
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	so I will speak about this point	454.979	3.181
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	subsequently but I hope you got this	456.06	4.139
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	number where I got that from and you	458.16	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	tell me whether this is a worrying	460.199	3.361
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	situation or not please be a little bit	461.58	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	rational I'm not trying to sway you from	463.56	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	one way to the other I'm simply trying	465.66	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to bring forth the Viewpoint what is the	467.52	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	difference between a responsible	469.62	3.479
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Monopoly creation with service and	470.94	4.199
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	irresponsible Monopoly creation so let's	473.099	4.081
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	move on and let's try to take a look as	475.139	4.141
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to what the hidden incentives are for	477.18	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	example if the Tata group ends up	479.28	4.62
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	becoming a big Monopoly who is it that	481.44	4.379
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	eventually benefits vis-a-vis let's do	483.9	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the same comparison for adani group so	485.819	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	here is the entire roadmap of the Tata	487.86	4.559
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Empire and they own all these different	490.139	5.28
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	companies and just for context 66	492.419	6.661
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	percent of this entire space is owned by	495.419	6.361
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	a company called as Tata Sons right Tata	499.08	5.339
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Suns now what is the Tata Sun Tata Suns	501.78	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is run by two different trusts and they	504.419	4.441
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	donate a large chunk or a major chunk of	506.52	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that money to different philanthropies	508.86	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	so if the Tata group becomes big most of	510.419	4.8
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that money would be donated in form of	513.24	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Charities now would similar be the case	515.219	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	in adani groups so who owns the adani	517.5	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	group so again here is the snippet and	519.959	3.301
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you can see that it is owned and	521.64	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	operated by the adani family so here is	523.26	4.139
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the entire roadmap and I will present	525.72	3.36
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	some Finance around it so that this	527.399	3.361
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	concept sticks so there are four	529.08	2.939
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	specific points that you need to	530.76	2.94
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	understand see if there is an	532.019	3.541
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	independent business for example I have	533.7	3.36
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	started this company called as wisdom	535.56	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	hatch and if I do a wonderful job and if	537.06	4.62
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	I am able to educate every single person	539.76	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	about finance and in that process I	541.68	3.659
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	become a multi-billionaire there is	543.839	3.06
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	nothing wrong why because this is a	545.339	3.0
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	private business that I've started I	546.899	3.06
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	have not taken anyone's money I am not	548.339	3.301
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	burning anyone's money I'm not taking	549.959	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Public's money this is entirely a	551.64	4.319
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	private business but on the flip side	553.86	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	what majority of these infrastructure	555.959	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	driven monopolies for example Tata is	558.18	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	also an infrastructure driven Monopoly	560.339	4.381
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and adanis are also an infrastructure	562.2	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	driven monopolies what do they typically	564.72	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	do okay so this is how the flow works	566.64	5.1
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and they end up procuring a lot of debt	568.92	5.16
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	from banks for example recently Bank of	571.74	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Baroda made the announcement that they	574.08	2.819
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are going to lend more money to the	575.64	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Irani group similarly LIC it is not a	576.899	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	bank but again it is funded by public	579.18	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money so all these institutes give one	580.86	4.68
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	form of debt or the other to these big	583.5	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	monopolies so how are they getting their	585.54	4.919
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money to go and build airports go and	587.88	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	build ports how are they doing it well	590.459	3.841
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	by procuring public money one way or the	592.08	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	other then what happens they end up	594.3	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	creating a monopoly now then you need to	596.22	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	take a look at the most important step	598.44	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that hey when this entire Monopoly is	600.3	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	created two things are going to happen	602.58	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	either that company is going to win it	604.08	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is going to become really big who	606.3	3.539
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	benefits in that case in tata's case	607.92	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	they end up giving majority of it to	609.839	3.781
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	charity and you make the same analysis	611.64	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	for the adani group but in the event	613.62	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	these businesses fail then what happens	615.6	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	well then we go to step one that it is	617.76	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the public that will end up footing the	620.16	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	bill for their failure how exactly I'll	622.32	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	explain that subsequently but I hope you	624.42	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	got this complex Financial story as to	626.64	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	what is a responsible Monopoly versus	628.74	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	irresponsible Monopoly now coming back	630.72	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to the initial graph that I had shown	633.18	3.839
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you that hey in the event the Tata	634.86	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	groups business fail or the likely	637.019	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	failure of Tata groups business what is	639.0	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the probability of that it is fairly low	640.98	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	why because again take a look at that	643.26	4.5
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	number that their debt payment cycle is	645.24	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	fairly small it has been designed or	647.76	4.259
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	managed in such a way on the flip side	649.98	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	take a look at the debt repayment	652.019	3.781
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	capacity of the adani group how soon	653.7	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	they can liquidate their assets and pay	655.8	3.18
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	back all these things need to be	657.54	3.359
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	considered so that is the Viewpoint that	658.98	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is entirely data driven please form your	660.899	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	own opinions you don't need to trust my	662.94	4.8
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	words on it just simply look at publicly	664.86	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	available data so then comes the natural	667.74	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	question that from time to time	669.6	3.299
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	different governments I'm saying	671.16	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	governments not government so from time	672.899	3.301
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to time different governments have	674.7	3.3
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	partnered up with different business	676.2	4.259
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	groups in order to give a part of	678.0	4.68
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	publicly run businesses and convert them	680.459	4.201
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	into private businesses so to say why	682.68	3.779
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are the PPP or public private	684.66	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	partnership model there is nothing wrong	686.459	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	with it again as long as it is being	688.5	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	done responsibly it is completely fine	690.36	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	if the group is sensible if the group	692.399	4.141
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	has good intent all those are good	694.56	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	things nothing wrong with it but see you	696.54	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	need to understand the pace at which	698.76	4.019
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	this game is being played think about it	700.74	3.779
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	this way that if you are giving Publix	702.779	4.201
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money to some private business and	704.519	4.861
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	asking them to create ports airports Etc	706.98	4.979
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and if they ask that you know what give	709.38	4.68
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	us like 10 000 crore of money or twenty	711.959	3.421
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	thousand fifty thousand crore of money	714.06	3.36
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	next year again give us 50 000 more of	715.38	3.6
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money we will create like more airports	717.42	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	this is is just too fast an expansion so	718.98	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	please keep that in mind and just for	721.26	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	context let us pick the case study for	723.0	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airports just to show how irresponsibly	724.92	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	this has been done there are eight	727.14	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	public private partnership run airports	728.82	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	in India seven of them have gone to	731.16	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	adani you tell me whether this is being	732.899	3.781
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	done sensibly or not now I will not	734.64	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	speak more otherwise this issue becomes	736.68	3.839
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	political but I hope you are able to	738.48	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	draw your own inferences out of it now	740.519	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you might have a natural response that	742.86	3.3
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	why this airport thing is being blown	744.42	3.3
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	out of proportion everyone is talking	746.16	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	about it why is that the case so let us	747.72	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	pick case study of another country how	749.88	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	their airports is run so here is the	751.86	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	American case study and there only one	753.72	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	airport is such which is not run by	755.94	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	their local or central government all	758.16	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	else is government controlled so that is	760.019	3.841
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	a simple point they are not privatized	762.06	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	of course we can get into entire debate	763.86	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that in the US a lot of businesses are	765.779	3.781
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	privately run for example healthcare	768.06	3.06
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	companies I get it but here I'm just	769.56	3.18
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	picking the case study of airports	771.12	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	because the Indian airport business is	772.74	3.599
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	going to become one of the most	774.839	3.721
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	lucrative businesses going forward in	776.339	4.021
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the world in terms of domestic traffic	778.56	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that we are getting in terms of the	780.36	3.36
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	wealth growth that is happening in India	782.04	3.419
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	so this needs to be looked further into	783.72	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	so now comes the final piece of the	785.459	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	puzzle as to how this entire mechanism	787.2	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is played out well it is done by the	789.36	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Banks and recently I was surprised to	791.279	5.041
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	read the commentary of CEO MD of Bank of	793.5	4.86
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Baroda who literally said that we will	796.32	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	continue to lend money to the adani	798.36	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	group as long as they meet our	800.399	3.481
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	underwriting standards and I'll say okay	802.2	2.939
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	what is wrong with this they will	803.88	2.579
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	continue to lend to a particular	805.139	3.901
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	business okay he went on to add that I	806.459	4.261
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	do not bother about the stock market	809.04	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	volatility well you should bother	810.72	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	because Bank of Baroda is not a private	812.7	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	bank and you're not lending your own	814.62	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	money you are lending Public's money and	816.12	4.08
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	if some company whom you have lent money	818.339	3.481
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	to it is going through an uncertain	820.2	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	period Then you have to hold on you	821.82	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	can't give public statements like that	823.98	3.12
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	you know what we will continue to lend	825.48	3.18
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	them now you might say that akshat you	827.1	3.359
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	have some hidden agenda do you know more	828.66	4.619
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	about banking than MD CEOs no I do not	830.459	4.741
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	but here is the track record that I can	833.279	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	see that over the last 10 years this is	835.2	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the amount of public money that bank of	837.24	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that has lost so when they talk about	839.16	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	their underwriting standards please take	841.2	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	it with a grain of salt and I as a	843.06	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	common citizen has every right to ask	845.16	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	these type of questions it does not make	847.2	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	me biased it just simply makes me	849.18	3.48
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	logical a person who takes a look at	850.86	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	data and asks relevant questions and	852.66	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that is the same approach I would	854.88	3.12
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	encourage you to understand now given	856.2	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	how complicated the finance world is the	858.0	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	lending space is all this is given a	860.16	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	nationalistic color right now for	862.56	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	example akshat is against Indians	864.06	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	getting loans from Indian banks no that	865.98	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is not the point that is the reason why	868.139	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	I brought the example of tatas I am not	870.18	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	against businesses getting loans but you	872.399	3.841
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	please need to understand the difference	874.62	3.659
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	between responsible and irresponsible	876.24	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	monopolies whether we require them in	878.279	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the first place if they are being	880.8	3.479
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	financed by banks with poor track record	882.24	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and there is brazenness associated with	884.279	3.841
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	the fact that we'll continue to lend	886.62	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	however we wanted our underwriting	888.12	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	standards are strong but our track	890.04	3.9
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	record shows otherwise that is just	891.839	4.201
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	plain wrong so Point number one is that	893.94	3.899
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Banks should support private groups	896.04	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	there is no harm in that but they should	897.839	4.56
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	support responsible lending that is a	900.24	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	simple message that I'll leave you with	902.399	3.24
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Point number two monopolies should be	903.66	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	built when required we do not probably	905.639	4.44
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	require monopolies in every sector every	907.62	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	space of the domain just because private	910.079	4.2
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	sector is better every time a monopoly	911.94	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is built few years down the line the jio	914.279	3.721
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	example plays out that they will	916.68	3.42
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	continue to raise prices do whatever you	918.0	3.72
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	like I can guarantee you that whatever	920.1	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	your mobile bill is today in 2023 you	921.72	5.28
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are going to pay 2x of that by 2028.	924.42	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Third and very important point is that	927.0	4.32
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	please do not confuse nationalism with a	928.8	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	private business that benefits a	931.32	3.66
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	specific family those two are very very	932.94	3.839
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	different thing if some Indian company	934.98	3.96
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is doing an amazing job we should all	936.779	4.441
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Lord that effort no doubt about that but	938.94	4.259
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	that does not give them a leeway to keep	941.22	3.84
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	things unclear then comes the fourth	943.199	3.961
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	point that the public money needs to be	945.06	4.139
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	spent responsibly we should not have	947.16	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	problems like like you know what banks	949.199	3.301
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	are just lending that banks are not even	950.94	4.079
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	able to recover 25 of their bad loans	952.5	4.74
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	well it is very easy for me to shut up	955.019	4.081
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	and not speak about these topics but I	957.24	3.599
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	took a stand I hope that you would	959.1	3.479
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	support me why because of the simple	960.839	4.081
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	fact that back when Vijay mallya niram	962.579	4.26
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	Modi took loans ran away and now Vijay	964.92	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	mallya actually sits on his Twitter on	966.839	3.541
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	every bank holiday tweets about and	968.639	3.301
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	mocks Indian citizens that was	970.38	3.78
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	irresponsible capitalism and I hope that	971.94	4.019
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	people do not lose their sense of what	974.16	4.02
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	is real and what is not and preserve	975.959	4.38
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	their sense of data analysis and taking	978.18	4.14
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	decisions using their brain because God	980.339	3.721
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	has given all of us our brain please	982.32	3.54
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	look at facts independently and please	984.06	3.719
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	reach a conclusion and please do not	985.86	3.659
58BFNeLOxJA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58BFNeLOxJA	associate everything with nationalistic	987.779	3.42

uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	be a good bet for income oriented	173.28	4.26
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	investors now the one thing to keep in	175.14	4.379
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	mind though is that's more of a cash	177.54	3.36
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	management tool it comes with some	179.519	3.241
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	reinvestment risk so you may want to	180.9	3.839
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	look for some other options for you know	182.76	4.02
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	kind of cashing in for lack of a better	184.739	5.22
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	word on this uh phenomenon yeah as Jack	186.78	4.86
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	has pointed out you might want if you	189.959	3.0
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	think a recession is coming then you	191.64	2.64
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	might want to go out to say a 10-year	192.959	2.761
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	bond because those yields would probably	194.28	2.819
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	come down you've locked in the higher	195.72	3.12
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	yield get a little capital gain yeah and	197.099	3.841
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	it always comes down to not just where	198.84	3.72
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	you think the Market's going but your	200.94	3.54
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	time Horizon and your investment needs	202.56	3.06
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	that's certainly part of the calculus	204.48	2.88
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	when you figure out what kind of bond	205.62	3.36
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	situation makes the most sense for you	207.36	3.599
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	so again the six month very good as a	208.98	3.839
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	cash management tool if you do want to	210.959	2.881
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	go further out you could look at the	212.819	3.481
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	10-year one Keith though pay attention	213.84	3.899
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	to credit quality it can be very	216.3	2.88
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	enticing to get in on some of these	217.739	4.14
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	high-yield products but they come with	219.18	4.979
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	credit default risk one and two years	221.879	3.901
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	look pretty good too but speaking of	224.159	4.14
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	default risk talk about corporates do	225.78	3.72
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	you want to go there you get what an	228.299	3.0
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	extra percentage point in return for a	229.5	3.659
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	tiny bit of risk but you know high grade	231.299	3.36
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	corporates are pretty good bet yeah high	233.159	2.881
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	grade corporates are another good bet	234.659	2.58
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	one thing you'd want to look at is	236.04	2.52
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	something like the Vanguard short-term	237.239	4.08
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	corporate bond ETF yielding around 4.9	238.56	6.66
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	right now um duration of about 2.9 years	241.319	5.941
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	and you're looking at Bonds in companies	245.22	5.219
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	such as Bank of America Apple you know	247.26	5.399
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	some pretty solid Blue Chip you've heard	250.439	3.541
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	of them they're not going to go bust	252.659	3.0
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	anytime soon so I think you're pretty	253.98	4.8
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	safe there alrighty so now Andrew the	255.659	5.401
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	third side maybe of these high rates is	258.78	3.6
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	the housing market it's really playing	261.06	3.54
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	Havoc there lots of cross currents I	262.38	3.66
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	think basically people want to know is	264.6	2.879
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	my house going to go up in value or down	266.04	3.42
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	in value well that's tough to say I mean	267.479	5.041
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	home sales are down for about 12 months	269.46	4.739
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	in a row and they're down about 30	272.52	3.84
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	percent year over year home prices	274.199	4.081
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	though we're holding up relatively well	276.36	3.72
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	they're down about five percent or so	278.28	3.78
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	from the peak last year but the market	280.08	3.48
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	is actually holding up better than many	282.06	3.24
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	people thought given the mortgage rates	283.56	3.419
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	have almost doubled to uh six and a	285.3	3.0
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	quarter percent and of course home	286.979	3.421
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	values really spiked during covet so	288.3	3.36
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	maybe down five percent over a year but	290.4	2.76
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	still up right nicely over two or three	291.66	3.0
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	years yeah it's still up nicely it	293.16	2.7
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	depends on the area of the country I	294.66	2.58
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	mean one thing it continues to support	295.86	3.0
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	the market is low inventories	297.24	3.42
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	particularly in affluent desirable parts	298.86	3.48
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	of the country whether it be areas like	300.66	3.42
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	Sarasota and Florida and some of the New	302.34	3.66
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	York suburbs it's hard to find homes in	304.08	3.48
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	many of these areas because somebody's	306.0	2.88
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	locked in a two and three quarter	307.56	2.82
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	mortgage rate they really don't want to	308.88	2.64
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	go anywhere right yeah I mean that's	310.38	2.64
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	that's basically preventing a lot of	311.52	2.64
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	homes from coming on the market people	313.02	2.34
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	have three percent mortgage they don't	314.16	2.7
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	want to sell and have to basically get a	315.36	3.059
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	six percent loan right now so that's	316.86	3.42
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	keeping inventories low which is uh	318.419	4.021
uofwN7m1aoM	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofwN7m1aoM	keeping prices relatively High we're	320.28	3.24

g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	looking at a monthly candle for people	71.939	3.901
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	who are new what is the meaning of nifty	74.1	4.199
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	50 this is the collection of top 50	75.84	4.919
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	companies in India and we are looking at	78.299	4.261

g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	month after month so what you would	82.56	3.72
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	notice is that consecutively for the	84.299	3.901
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	last four months the markets have been	86.28	3.479
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	going down and something very	88.2	3.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	interesting is happening in this last	89.759	3.421
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	candle and I'm not sure if you can	91.5	4.02
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	actually see this so this pattern this	93.18	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	last pattern where there is a very very	95.52	4.2
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	small body you can't even see it and a	96.96	5.28
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	very long Wick this pattern is called as	99.72	5.16
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	doji pattern and I will link some of my	102.24	4.44
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	videos on technical analysis in the	104.88	3.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	description and comment box where I have	106.68	3.54

g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	this pattern so whenever you see this	115.619	4.261
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	type of a doji pattern it shows in this	117.78	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	decisiveness in the market so what is	119.88	3.84
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the meaning of indecisiveness it means	122.1	2.82
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that you know what the market does not	123.72	3.359

g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	should be going down so that is the	127.079	4.321
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	meaning of indecision but you have to	129.179	3.721
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	relate this to the next point that I'm	131.4	3.479
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	telling you that again go back and	132.9	3.6
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	revisit this chart and what you will	134.879	3.661
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	notice is that okay similar levels so	136.5	3.959
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	you are seeing this level of 17 200	138.54	4.74
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	again this level existed back in	140.459	5.64
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	September of 21 which means that almost	143.28	4.56
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	one and a half years have happened and	146.099	3.601
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the Indian markets have given zero	147.84	4.14
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	percent return so to me as a logical	149.7	5.58
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	investor it makes zero sense to be a net	151.98	5.28
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	seller in the market so to cut the long	155.28	4.02
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	story short I am bullish about the	157.26	4.38
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	market both from a midterm to long-term	159.3	4.56
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	perspective can also add to this and	161.64	5.099
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	here is NASDAQ Composite so us index so	163.86	4.26
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that has gone up and given quite	166.739	2.941
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	aggressive returns over the last one	168.12	2.94
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	month so it has gone up by six and a	169.68	3.0
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	half seven percent so which is fairly	171.06	3.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	healthy return and it shows that the	172.68	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	markets are breaking out in the US why	174.36	3.9
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	it is not happening in India so again	176.76	2.88
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	you are smart enough there is a big	178.26	2.88
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	company that is creating like a lot of	179.64	3.06
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	hooplas so it's because of primarily	181.14	3.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that now I know a lot of you would be	182.7	3.119
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	thinking yeah actually you're saying you	184.44	2.939
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	are bullish about the market and on	185.819	2.941
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	other hand you have sold your stocks	187.379	3.36
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	worth like 40 50 lakhs so what is going	188.76	4.199
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	on and are you a dogla person so let me	190.739	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	explain it to you again in simple bullet	192.959	3.901
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	point format so I sold these stocks on	194.819	5.961
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	31st of March 2023.	196.86	3.92
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	nothing like this this is basically the	200.9	5.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	last day of the financial year to do tax	203.76	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	loss harvesting so what is the meaning	206.22	3.84
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	of tax loss harvesting so let me explain	208.26	4.559
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that by using a simple example so all of	210.06	4.38
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	you know who have been following me that	212.819	4.681
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	I am mostly an investor so I buy stocks	214.44	4.799
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	hold it and hold it for years and years	217.5	4.26
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	together and also I take some swing	219.239	4.021
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	trades from time to time this is the	221.76	3.059
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	information that I have disclosed quite	223.26	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	aggressively on my YouTube channel so	224.819	4.021
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	basically what tax loss harvesting	227.04	3.839
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	allows you to do it that in India we	228.84	3.42
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	have something called as short-term	230.879	3.0
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	capital gains tax now what is the	232.26	3.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	meaning of this so let's say that I have	233.879	3.121
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	invested a lot of money in the stock	235.56	3.599
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	market in the last one year and I have a	237.0	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	total loss of say 10 lakh Rupees so this	239.159	3.781
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	is notional loss because I have not	241.5	4.019
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	decided to sell my stocks yet and also I	242.94	4.68
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	traded as per the market circumstances	245.519	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	and let's say that I made a real profit	247.62	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	of 10 lakh Rupees so basically this is	250.019	3.961
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the profit that I've already booked now	252.12	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	as per short term capital gains tax rule	253.98	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	because I have booked these profits	256.44	3.479
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	these are not notional profits these are	258.06	3.98
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	real profits I would have to pay 15	259.919	4.921
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	short-term capital gains tax now in	262.04	4.96
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	order to avoid that what I can do is so	264.84	4.859
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	I can offset this profit against these	267.0	5.24
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	losses so I will not have to pay this 15	269.699	5.101
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	short-term capital gains tax so I hope	272.24	4.36
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	this simple concept is clear and this	274.8	4.26
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	concept is called as tax loss harvesting	276.6	5.7
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	now comes a natural response should we	279.06	5.16
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	always do tax loss harvesting the answer	282.3	3.72
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	is no it's not as if that you absolutely	284.22	3.96
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	need to do it if you are very happy with	286.02	4.02
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	your stock picks for that particular	288.18	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	year even if they are at a loss you can	290.04	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	continue to hold them no problem there	292.68	3.6
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	but this definitely gives you an	294.54	3.659
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	opportunity especially if you are in	296.28	4.44
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	profit to kind of off set and refine	298.199	4.5

g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	topic that I am not bearish about the	364.259	3.841
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	market at all whatever money I have got	365.88	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	by selling all these stocks it was a	368.1	3.84
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	simple mechanism of tax loss harvesting	369.96	4.019
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	I will be reinvesting that money into	371.94	4.38
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the market and final point is that there	373.979	4.261
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	are stocks that I will not be rebuying	376.32	3.48
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	right so this is the list again please	378.24	3.66
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	take a look some of these stocks I am	379.8	4.019
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	not going to rebuy at all some of the	381.9	3.54
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	stocks I might consider buying	383.819	3.66
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	subsequently so let me very quickly help	385.44	4.199
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	you understand the rationale as to why	387.479	4.261
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	have I decided to partially or fully	389.639	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	sell these stocks so the first stock	391.74	3.12
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that we are going to speak about is	393.419	3.361
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Amara Raja batteries this is a stock	394.86	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that I have completely exited and I have	396.78	4.38
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	no intent of rebuying it at least for a	399.18	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	substantial future so what is the reason	401.16	3.659
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	behind it so let me very quickly take	402.96	3.48
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	you through some important bullet points	404.819	3.781
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	so one of the key reasons why I decided	406.44	4.14
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	to invest in umrah Raja battery was that	408.6	4.14
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	it is one of India's foremost battery	410.58	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	makers right and I was very bullish	412.74	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	about the EV play that you know what lot	415.08	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	of cars are now moving to illiterate lot	417.06	4.68
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	of two wheelers are moving to Electric	419.4	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	but unfortunately what has happened in	421.74	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	this entire EV play is that the adoption	423.9	4.919
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	and innovation in battery is still very	426.24	4.56
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	much underplay so let me show you some	428.819	3.72
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	important data first and then I will	430.8	3.36
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	elaborate more on this point so if you	432.539	3.181
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	take a look at this particular chart	434.16	3.479
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	what you will see is that where is it	435.72	5.039
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that umra Raja is focusing on so 92	437.639	4.921
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	percent of money comes from Storage	440.759	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	batteries and what type of storage	442.56	4.199
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	batteries does Amara Raja makes so they	444.539	4.321
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	are predominantly into four wheelers and	446.759	4.38
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	inverters and and almost 50 percent of	448.86	4.2
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	their business comes from there now if	451.139	3.721
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	you ask a critical question that where	453.06	4.139
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	is it Raja battery is currently focused	454.86	4.26
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	on so the answer comes out to be lead	457.199	4.141
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	acid batteries so one natural question	459.12	4.019
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	after looking at all the data that	461.34	3.24
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	should come in your mind is very simple	463.139	4.021
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	lead asset batteries but if we are	464.58	4.679
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	looking at the adoption of the EV space	467.16	4.62
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	then how good are lead asset batteries	469.259	4.801
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	so to cut the long story short there are	471.78	4.259
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	four major EV batteries one is called as	474.06	3.66
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	lithium ion one is called as nickel	476.039	3.841
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	metal third is called as lead acid it	477.72	4.199
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	and then there are Ultra capacitors now	479.88	3.539
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	out of this what has started to happen	481.919	3.421
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	is that lithium ion batteries have	483.419	4.381
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	started to gain a lot of prominence and	485.34	4.38
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	they are much better compared to lead	487.8	3.839
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	asset Batteries Now what is the reason	489.72	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	why lithium ion are better than lead	491.639	3.9
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	acid so I can make an entire video on	493.5	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that but here is a very quick snippet	495.539	4.201
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that shows the limitation of lead acid	497.28	4.56
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	batteries so I do not feel that Amara	499.74	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Raja battery is going forward is going	501.84	3.539
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	to be highly competitive when it comes	503.52	4.44
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	to EV based battery manufacturing they	505.379	4.561
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	will have to reinvent the wheel and try	507.96	4.019
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	to gain expertise in it so this looks	509.94	3.42
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	like a very shaky space so I am	511.979	3.18
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	completely out of this top I have booked	513.36	3.599
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	a loss on this stock and I am not	515.159	3.841
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	looking to re-enter that stock as per	516.959	3.841
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	current information now on top of this	519.0	3.539
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	if you take a look at the company's	520.8	3.359
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	profit growth rate for the last five	522.539	3.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	years it's very dismal it is not even	524.159	3.541
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	beating inflation so the growth rate has	525.839	4.141
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	been fairly slow and this primarily	527.7	3.96
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	might be because of the fact that they	529.98	3.479
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	are not able to evolve from that lead	531.66	3.72
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	acid battery game okay so the second	533.459	3.361
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	stock that I'm going to discuss very	535.38	3.54
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	quickly is Gillette India they make like	536.82	4.019
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	shaving cream so shaving brush razors	538.92	3.599
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	this that so they are primarily into	540.839	2.94
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	grooming's product and it's a	542.519	3.301
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	multi-billion dollar company very strong	543.779	4.021
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	company International Company lot of	545.82	3.54
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	product Innovation lot of good good	547.8	3.479
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	things so then why did I decide to sell	549.36	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	this particular stock let me quickly	551.279	3.901
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	give you my perspective and whether or	553.14	3.54
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	not I'll be re-entering this so the	555.18	2.94
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	short answer is no I will not be	556.68	3.36
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	re-entering Gillette India as of now so	558.12	3.48
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the first key trouble that the company	560.04	3.84
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	is facing is that it is in a category	561.6	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	where they are unable to raise the	563.88	4.579
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	prices of the products	565.68	6.06
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	yes I agree but not at the level that	568.459	5.201
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	hul and other companies have been able	571.74	3.719
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	to raise prices of their product now	573.66	3.42
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	think about it this way that Hindustan	575.459	3.361
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Unilever products have very strong brand	577.08	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	value Jeanette also has a very strong	578.82	4.44
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	brand value but Hindustan Unilever is	580.86	4.919
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	able to increase its product prices but	583.26	4.86
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Gillette India is unable to do this now	585.779	3.781
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	why is that happening so there are two	588.12	2.88
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	critical reasons that I can think about	589.56	3.42
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	it so first and foremost take a look at	591.0	3.72
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	this chart and what you will see is that	592.98	3.84
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that almost 80 percent of gillette's	594.72	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	business comes from grooming segment now	596.82	4.16
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	grooming means	598.8	4.68
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	now what has started to happen in this	600.98	3.82
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	space there are two things that has	603.48	3.06
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	started to happen so the first key thing	604.8	2.88
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	is that there is competition	606.54	3.0
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	segmentation that is happening now what	607.68	2.76
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	is the meaning of competition	609.54	3.18
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	segmentation for example female shaving	610.44	4.079
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	range then you have men's shaving range	612.72	3.299
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	then you have like some dhadi banane	614.519	3.601
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Wala oil all these different different	616.019	4.201
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	categories are getting segmented into	618.12	3.779
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	different different companies there are	620.22	3.119
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	highly Niche companies that have come	621.899	3.12
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	out who now what they have started to do	623.339	3.68
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	is SketchUp or Virat colleges	625.019	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	so they have created an entire company	627.019	4.121
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	on that so what has started to happen is	629.339	3.18
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that there is massive competition	631.14	3.6
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	segmentation that is happening so in	632.519	3.841
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	this type of a business there is no	634.74	3.96
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	economies of scale that is benefiting a	636.36	3.72
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	company like Gillette as per my	638.7	3.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	understanding this is the first critical	640.08	3.84
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	point and you need to see this in	642.0	3.66
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	conjunction with the second point which	643.92	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	is called as d2c sales so d2c sales	645.66	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	means for example you would have seen	648.24	3.62
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	these days	650.16	4.44
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	have started selling directly to you	651.86	5.7
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	through YouTube ads	654.6	6.44
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	meditation and then	657.56	5.98
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	memory foam and whatnot so basically	661.04	4.12
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	what has started to happen over the last	663.54	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	four or five years is that d2c sales is	665.16	5.1
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	getting easier and distribution in d2c	667.86	3.86
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	has become easier	670.26	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	company or the mattress company that I'm	671.72	3.94
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	speaking about they can directly	674.04	3.9
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	manufacture it at a small scale and ship	675.66	4.26
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the product to you so this direct to	677.94	4.26
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Consumer selling is definitely hurting a	679.92	4.26
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	company like Gillette India as of now so	682.2	3.48
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	I do not see how they will be able to	684.18	3.24
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	maintain their mood one of the Prime	685.68	3.36
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	reasons for this has been that that	687.42	3.539
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	gillette's India products are already	689.04	5.1
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	very crazily highly priced for example I	690.959	5.101
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	can talk about Mach 3. now go and check	694.14	5.36
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	how expensive the blades are avoids	696.06	5.58
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	what are you going to do with it it's	699.5	3.579
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	not as if that you know what people will	701.64	3.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	be able to send a child you shave from	703.079	3.781
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	like Mark III no one cares about that	704.94	3.72
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	because they can't see and neither can	706.86	3.24
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	you prove that you have actually done	708.66	3.119
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	shaving from like using Mark 3 or	710.1	3.12
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	whatever right so this is the problem	711.779	3.421
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	with Gillette products right now that	713.22	3.6
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	they are already very highly priced	715.2	3.66
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	competition is increasing and there is	716.82	3.84
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	no way any even show the brand right so	718.86	3.06
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	they cannot even increase the prices	720.66	3.6
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	like crazy so for me this type of a	721.92	4.14
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	large company is likely to suffer in the	724.26	4.079
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	future so I am not re-entering it I had	726.06	3.839
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	purchased Gillette India because I was	728.339	2.781
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	getting it at a decent price	729.899	3.601
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	unfortunately the price kept on falling	731.12	4.48
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	so I hope this point is clear so the	733.5	3.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	third stock that we are going to speak	735.6	3.479
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	about is AstraZeneca so basically it's a	736.8	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Pharma company and it manufactures a ton	739.079	4.26
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	of pharmaceutical medicines and these	741.3	3.9
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	are some of its best seller medicines in	743.339	4.021
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	India so this is the primary business	745.2	4.259
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	model of AstraZeneca now what is the	747.36	3.599
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	problem with astrazeneca's business	749.459	3.661
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	right now so one of the key problems	750.959	3.661
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that they are facing right now is that	753.12	3.06
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	they have not been able to launch	754.62	4.459
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Blockbuster drugs on sustainable basis	756.18	5.339
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	and it takes a lot of cycle time for	759.079	4.721
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	them to go and launch Blockbuster drugs	761.519	3.841
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Blockbuster drugs means that you know	763.8	4.02
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	very high value drug that is raking in a	765.36	4.38
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	lot of money for them and this reflects	767.82	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	in their sales that if you consider even	769.74	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	from like 2017 they have not even	771.6	4.2
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	doubled their sales despite the entire	773.82	4.44
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	covet growth so hardly any massive	775.8	4.02
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	uptick in the business now if you	778.26	2.94
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	consider sales growth again this is	779.82	2.819
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	reflected that if that if you consider	781.2	3.6
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	last 10-year kagger four percent growth	782.639	3.661
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	rate for the firm which is not like very	784.8	3.659
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	healthy if you consider its capacity	786.3	4.14
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	expansion again the picture is not like	788.459	3.601
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	very healthy that if you take a look at	790.44	4.079
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	their fixed asset capacity expansion so	792.06	3.959
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	it's not as if that they are showing a	794.519	3.06
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	lot of faith in terms of their expansion	796.019	3.0
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	capabilities they are not pouring in	797.579	3.0
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	more money they used to put in more	799.019	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	money back in like 20 15 16 17 all these	800.579	4.56
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	years compared to what they are putting	803.339	3.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	now so again it's not a very healthy	805.139	2.76
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	sign it doesn't look like that the	806.639	2.76
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	company is focusing too much on growth	807.899	2.88
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	or at least they don't know where the	809.399	3.12
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	growth is going to come from so they are	810.779	3.721
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	just waiting and watching so these type	812.519	4.021
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	of stocks can take a substantially long	814.5	3.66
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	amount of time to recover now of course	816.54	3.12
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	right I can be wrong I'm simply	818.16	3.359
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	presenting my analysis so these three	819.66	4.02
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	stocks are completely exiting so one	821.519	4.56
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	stock that I have sold partially and I	823.68	4.2
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	will probably re-enter it and buy more	826.079	4.081
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	of it subsequently is Hathaway cables so	827.88	4.019
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	let me very quickly explain you the pros	830.16	3.9
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	and cons of Hathaway cables and what are	831.899	3.781
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the risk and reward equation I see with	834.06	3.24
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	them so if you consider the business	835.68	4.219
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Outlook of Hathaway cables so it's not	837.3	4.979
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	right it's not as if that sales has gone	839.899	4.06
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	up massively over the last several years	842.279	3.36
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	but having said this there has been	843.959	3.481
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	turnaround in their fortunes because	845.639	3.961
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	they are now making profits without	847.44	4.019
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	increasing their sales too much so if	849.6	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	you go on the promoter tab what you will	851.459	3.961
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	notice is that you know what that Geo it	853.38	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	went and bought Hathaway cables in the	855.42	4.919
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	year 2020 and over time it has reduced	857.7	4.68
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	it because as per semi mandate that	860.339	3.541
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	promoter has to bring down their	862.38	4.56
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	shareholding to 75 so Reliance had to	863.88	4.74
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	sell that now because Reliance had to	866.94	3.72
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	sell it the stock did not move quite	868.62	3.899
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	aggressively that's point one and there	870.66	3.84
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	was massive beating of small cap Medicap	872.519	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	companies so since 2017 2018 the small	874.5	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	caps and mid caps have been badly beaten	877.019	3.901
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	and Hathaway cable also became a	879.0	3.899
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	collateral damage so to say so this is	880.92	3.599
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	my perspective it's not as if that	882.899	3.481
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	halfway cable has some massive problem	884.519	4.081
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	going with it it has been acquired in a	886.38	4.259
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	way by the Reliance group now Reliance	888.6	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	will fit halfway cable into its jio plan	890.639	4.44
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	and then look at the overall expansion	892.68	4.2
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	so then why did I decide to sell or	895.079	3.301
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	lighten my position on Hathaway cable	896.88	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the reason is very very simple that I am	898.38	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	not completely sure how Reliance is	900.66	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	going to operate from this point one of	902.88	3.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the key good things that happened with	904.74	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Reliance stock was around 2020 2021	906.18	5.339
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	period when they were able to raise a	909.06	4.2
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	lot of capital that led to the	911.519	3.721
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	burgeoning of their stock so all good	913.26	4.199
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	good tech companies invested NGO so	915.24	3.599
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	there is a long-term game plan that	917.459	4.141
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Reliance has which is good news and the	918.839	5.281
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Reliance stock gave a run up but now we	921.6	4.2
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	need to be clear that whatever next	924.12	3.24
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	layer of growth is going to happen from	925.8	3.659
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Reliance we need to be sure where it's	927.36	3.839
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	going to come from you can see from the	929.459	3.301
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	shareholding pattern that it is mostly	931.199	3.601
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	controlled by the Reliance family and	932.76	4.259
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the problem with family owned stocks is	934.8	3.839
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that they will move whenever the family	937.019	4.32
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	wants the stock price to move right it	938.639	4.5
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	does not depend on the fundamental stock	941.339	3.901
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	performance that is the primary issue	943.139	4.081
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that I have with Reliance now again	945.24	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	please go and take a look between the	947.22	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	time period 2009 all the way till	949.32	4.56
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	2016-17 Reliance gave zero percent	951.3	5.3
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	return now some of you might be confused	953.88	5.16
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	on what is happening no see again it's	956.6	5.02
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	same adani story that when the family	959.04	5.099
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	owns a conglomerate and there are a set	961.62	4.8
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	of individual businesses around it the	964.139	3.601
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	money can move around these different	966.42	3.359
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	businesses now I can explain you how	967.74	3.719
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	exactly that happens that is highly	969.779	3.541
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	complex Corporate Finance but I think	971.459	4.141
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	you guys will get bored but I hope that	973.32	4.019
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	you get the message that Hathaway cable	975.6	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	will move in isolation compared to the	977.339	4.62
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Reliance group of Industries and Geo but	979.38	4.38
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	it is very unlikely that Hathaway cable	981.959	3.301
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	will individually move and other	983.76	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Reliance group companies will not so at	985.26	4.139
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	this stage I am not clearly seeing where	987.54	3.359
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the growth for Alliance will come from	989.399	3.0
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	so therefore I have lightened my	990.899	3.601
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	position on halfway cables also so the	992.399	3.721
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	final stock that I will speak about is	994.5	3.959
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Lal Path Labs now lalpath Labs has	996.12	4.079
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	fallen quite aggressively the reason why	998.459	4.021
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	I decided to purchase Lal path lab was	1000.199	4.44
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that it had fallen quite aggressively so	1002.48	3.779
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	I was getting it at a decent price but	1004.639	3.481
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	after I purchased it the market kept on	1006.259	4.08
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	going down and down and down and my loss	1008.12	4.019
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	kind of increase so let me very quickly	1010.339	3.781
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	help you understand the fundamentals so	1012.139	3.901
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	if you consider the sales figure it is	1014.12	4.079
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	doing fairly well if you consider the	1016.04	3.78
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	profit numbers again and there is no	1018.199	3.961
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	major problem with lalpath Labs docs so	1019.82	4.82
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	then a natural question comes	1022.16	4.74
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that it has fallen so much it was	1024.64	3.699
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	trading at four thousand now it is	1026.9	3.48
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	trading at 1800 so more than 55 60	1028.339	4.021
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	correction has happened so what exactly	1030.38	3.84
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	was the problem well according to me	1032.36	4.079
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	valuation was a problem that during	1034.22	5.04
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	covert times Lal path lab shown a lot of	1036.439	4.681
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	growth people were over betting on that	1039.26	4.319
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	stock and now the stock has come down to	1041.12	4.74
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	sensible levels in my opinion so this is	1043.579	4.62
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	a stock that I will 100 re-enter so then	1045.86	4.699
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	you might have a natural question	1048.199	4.801
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	so I feel that there are two ways in	1050.559	4.24
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	which this company will grow so one is	1053.0	4.2
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that it will expand its total diagnostic	1054.799	4.321
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	Centers and collection centers so I	1057.2	3.18
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	don't think that they are undertaking	1059.12	3.419
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that expansion drive as of now because	1060.38	3.9
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the real estate expansion has happened	1062.539	3.361
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	quite aggressively over the last few	1064.28	3.72
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	months number two the inflation has	1065.9	3.84
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	become very high and interest rates are	1068.0	3.48
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	also very high so they can't go and	1069.74	3.42
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	physically create too many centers	1071.48	3.96
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	without incurring too much expenses so	1073.16	3.66
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	they are probably looking at their	1075.44	3.239
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	expansion strategy and are deciding on	1076.82	3.44
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	the right	1078.679	4.141
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	but the fundamentals of the business is	1080.26	5.2
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	good the brand value of Dr Lyle path lab	1082.82	5.52
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	is good the industry is such where the	1085.46	4.98
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	prices are going to increase in terms of	1088.34	4.86
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	diagnostic testing for example very	1090.44	4.2
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	recently you might have read the news	1093.2	4.8
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	that from first April 2023 the price of	1094.64	5.159

g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	up by 12 15.	1099.799	3.26
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	critical medicines are going up then	1103.84	4.42

g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	going to become more expensive so by 12	1108.26	5.1
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	15 Dr Lal path lab will anyways grow	1110.48	4.98
g80TU1_IiDA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80TU1_IiDA	just by increasing their prices so out	1113.36	3.3

6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	school forever allow me to explain	3.06	4.199
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	throughout my time at school I never	4.92	4.56
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	really felt like I fitted in when I was	7.259	4.321
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	curious about something I was told to	9.48	4.619
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	keep quiet put my head down and get on	11.58	4.559
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	with my work but I found this impossible	14.099	4.321
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	as I'm naturally very hyperactive which	16.139	4.681
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	led to me always being in trouble so	18.42	4.439
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	when one of my teachers sat me down and	20.82	4.199
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	said let's be honest Mark you're not	22.859	4.201
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	going anywhere so here are your options	25.019	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	you either continue to study but it'll	27.06	5.039
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	be a waste of everyone's time or you can	29.519	5.281
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	leave and try and get a job it was one	32.099	4.741
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	of the best days of my life as I was	34.8	4.8
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	only focused on one thing leaving so I	36.84	4.44
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	waved goodbye to the school with no	39.6	3.959
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	qualifications or money under my belt	41.28	4.14
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	and when I became a millionaire in my	43.559	4.381
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	early twenties I was happy that I proved	45.42	4.319
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	my teachers wrong but even though I	47.94	3.779
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	succeeded I had very little Direction	49.739	4.201
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	and had to work out a lot of things by	51.719	4.201
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	myself that's why I'm making this video	53.94	3.9
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	because I wish I had something like this	55.92	4.08
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	when I was starting out if you follow	57.84	5.039
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	all the steps I'm about to share I don't	60.0	5.22
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	see how you won't be miles ahead of	62.879	5.041
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	everyone else actually I I pretty much	65.22	5.52
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	guarantee you will be if you follow all	67.92	5.28
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	of these Steps step one is to create an	70.74	4.26
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	investment budget a lot of people put	73.2	3.84
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	this as one of the last steps but that's	75.0	4.14
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	the main reason most people don't make	77.04	3.96
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	it they treat investing as an	79.14	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	afterthought rather than a priority I	81.0	4.259
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	believe there are three types of people	83.64	3.9
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	in the world wasters Warriors and	85.259	5.04
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	winners otherwise known as the three W's	87.54	4.56
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	wasters go through life spending	90.299	3.661
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	everything they earn they say things	92.1	3.6
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	like money doesn't make you happy	93.96	4.199
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	however at the same time they are	95.7	4.32
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	spending all of theirs trying to improve	98.159	3.901
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	their lives Warriors hold their money	100.02	4.32
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	like a squirrel saving its acorns for	102.06	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	winter they say things like money	104.34	4.919
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	doesn't grow on trees the sad thing is	106.56	4.739
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	even though these people have a lot of	109.259	4.261
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	money they often deprive themselves of	111.299	4.561
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	the Little Pleasures in life in order to	113.52	5.099
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	save a few extra dollars they're so	115.86	4.92
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	focused on using budgets to keep their	118.619	4.381
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	expenses down that they miss the far	120.78	4.199
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	bigger picture winners are the complete	123.0	3.84
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	opposite of both of these people they	124.979	4.081
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	are understand that money can make them	126.84	4.68
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	happy and that it does grow on trees if	129.06	4.62
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	they invest correctly they earn money	131.52	4.92
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	not to spend it but to invest or while	133.68	4.62
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	not depriving themselves of the things	136.44	3.96
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	that they enjoy to become a winner you	138.3	3.6
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	need to change the way you think about	140.4	4.08
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	money instead of seeing it as a tool to	141.9	4.74
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	get the things you want start viewing it	144.48	4.56
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	as a tool to get more money the only	146.64	4.44
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	other way to make money is by trading	149.04	4.559
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	your time and personally I'd rather use	151.08	4.68
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	my money than trade my literal years on	153.599	3.961
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	this Earth here's something to consider	155.76	3.839
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	if you work for a whole year and saved	157.56	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	up ten thousand dollars but you spent it	159.599	4.561
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	all on upgrades for your car you'd have	161.94	3.9
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	to save that money all over again	164.16	4.74
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	costing you another year however if you	165.84	5.28
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	invested it correctly you could use that	168.9	4.559
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	ten thousand to make a hundred thousand	171.12	4.08
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	dollars then you could purchase the	173.459	3.181
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	upgrades you want with some of the	175.2	3.539
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	profits and still have an extra ninety	176.64	3.72
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	thousand dollars that you can reinvest	178.739	3.541
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	that brings me on to step two which is	180.36	4.019
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	to increase your value let me tell you	182.28	4.62
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	the story of Cooper and Dwayne they both	184.379	4.801
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	lived in California and decided to take	186.9	4.559
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	up surfing as a new hobby Cooper	189.18	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	searched for the biggest waves every day	191.459	4.321
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	he didn't bother with the smaller ones	193.68	4.62
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	some days if he couldn't find any waves	195.78	4.62
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	big enough he just went home on the	198.3	4.14
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	other hand Dwayne went out every day and	200.4	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	rode as many waves as he could whether	202.44	4.439
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	big or small he simply enjoyed the	204.78	4.08
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	process of Surfing and improving his	206.879	4.261
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	skills one day Cooper and Dwayne were	208.86	4.68
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	out at Sea when a huge wave started to	211.14	4.86
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	build on the horizon Cooper thought to	213.54	5.04
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	himself this was exactly what he had	216.0	5.22
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	been waiting for a wave that was finally	218.58	4.739
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	big enough for him on the other hand	221.22	4.2
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	Dwayne was just excited to put his	223.319	3.961
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	skills to the test and thought of it	225.42	4.14
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	like any other way they both began	227.28	5.28
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	paddling Dwayne expertly popped up onto	229.56	5.039
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	his feet and rode inside the barrel of	232.56	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	the wave he looked back expecting to see	234.599	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	Cooper behind him but he wasn't there	236.94	4.859
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	Cooper had fallen off almost as soon as	239.099	5.101
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	the wave had arrived all he could do was	241.799	4.741
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	watch as Dwayne rode it all the way to	244.2	4.98

6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	just got lucky but the truth was Dwayne	249.18	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	had put in all the practice and learned	251.819	3.78
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	something from every wave he'd ever	253.68	3.959
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	caught this is how most people approach	255.599	3.961
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	getting rich they spend too long	257.639	3.84
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	searching for the one thing that will	259.56	4.079
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	make them a ton of money all while	261.479	4.021
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	ignoring the day-to-day things they can	263.639	4.141
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	be doing to increase their value huge	265.5	4.56
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	waves do come every now and again I've	267.78	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	benefited from the.com bubble in the	270.06	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	late 90s the house in bubble in the	272.16	5.52
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	2000s and the recent crypto boom however	274.44	5.039
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	I wouldn't have been able to take	277.68	3.9
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	advantage of them if I hadn't increased	279.479	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	my value by investing back into myself	281.58	4.619
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	when you start thinking this way you	283.979	4.381
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	stop seeing every online course or	286.199	4.56
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	YouTube video as the one thing that will	288.36	4.92
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	make you rich and instead just a little	290.759	4.561
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	wave to conquer and add to your skill	293.28	4.02
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	set so where should you focus your time	295.32	4.26
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	well if you notice there's a clear Gap	297.3	4.32
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	in the market for a certain skill such	299.58	4.08
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	as a plumber it really is a nightmare	301.62	4.139
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	finding a good plumber nowadays but	303.66	4.02
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	anyway that aside if you you decide to	305.759	4.261
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	go down this path it might make sense to	307.68	4.019
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	spend a thousand dollars to get a	310.02	3.6
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	qualification and then start making	311.699	3.961
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	upwards of five thousand dollars a month	313.62	4.26
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	over the course of a year that would be	315.66	4.92
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	a 60x return on your investment if you	317.88	4.56
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	can't think of anything to do don't	320.58	4.74
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	waste time waiting for waves instead you	322.44	5.099
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	can spend time mastering Universal	325.32	5.04
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	skills like public speaking negotiating	327.539	5.88
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	and content creation these skills will	330.36	4.86
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	all come in handy no matter what path	333.419	4.021
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	you decide to follow in the future as	335.22	4.319
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	they're all transferable and can be used	337.44	4.14
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	in multiple areas I'm not saying all	339.539	4.741
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	education is good I believe far too many	341.58	4.32
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	people are going to University for	344.28	3.3
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	degrees that aren't even worth the paper	345.9	4.079
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	they're written on however if you view	347.58	4.32
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	every skill as an investment and get	349.979	4.321
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	some kind of return on it then it's	351.9	4.62
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	worthwhile learning if it was me I would	354.3	4.08
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	repeat this step as many times as	356.52	4.2
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	possible until I've reached my maximum	358.38	4.62
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	earning potential step three is to open	360.72	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	investing accounts if you want to avoid	363.0	3.72
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	being a warrior then once you've increa	365.1	3.78
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	pretty sure any potential you're going	366.72	3.66
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	to need somewhere to invest your money	368.88	3.78
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	so it's time to open some accounts it's	370.38	4.319
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	a good idea to allocate a portion of	372.66	3.78
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	your investment budget into the stock	374.699	3.421
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	market this isn't likely to make you	376.44	3.66
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	rich in the short term but if you begin	378.12	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	early enough then in later years it will	380.1	4.379
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	start to compound it's just so much	382.62	3.84
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	easier than it was back in my day as you	384.479	3.961
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	can do it all from your phone there are	386.46	3.6
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	various different apps I'll leave some	388.44	3.66

6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	first investment but let me remind you	440.34	4.259
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	investing always carries a risk and the	442.139	4.56
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	value of any investment can decrease as	444.599	4.44
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	well as increase step four is to build	446.699	4.741
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	assets this is the real key to building	449.039	4.981
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	Mass wealth let me tell you the story of	451.44	5.22
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	John and Alex as it perfectly explains	454.02	4.98
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	this concept after John maxed out his	456.66	3.96
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	earning potential like we covered in	459.0	4.02
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	step one he just invested the rest of	460.62	4.139
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	his money into the stock market each	463.02	4.079
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	month in the hopes of becoming a	464.759	4.44
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	millionaire one day Alex didn't have the	467.099	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	same patience although he maxed out his	469.199	4.381
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	earning potential and invested in stocks	471.479	4.861
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	he also focused on building assets he	473.58	4.8
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	started by identifying a gap in the	476.34	4.259
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	market and put his unique skills to use	478.38	5.099
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	he created his own brand of craft beer	480.599	5.16
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	which he spent a lot of time perfecting	483.479	4.801
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	he experiment with different flavors	485.759	4.861
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	Brewing techniques and branding	488.28	5.039
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	strategies he even invested in creating	490.62	5.1
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	a website and social media accounts to	493.319	4.021
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	promote his product John on the other	495.72	3.84
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	hand was always skeptical of Alex's	497.34	4.139
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	business thinking that it was far too	499.56	4.44
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	much work with little return instead	501.479	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	John just kept investing the same amount	504.0	4.259
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	into the stock market every month a	505.979	4.021
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	couple of years went on and Alex's	508.259	3.84
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	business began to grow he started	510.0	4.02
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	getting orders from all over the country	512.099	4.201
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	and his craft beer became a household	514.02	4.98
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	name John however still had many years	516.3	4.679
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	left before his stock market Investments	519.0	3.899
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	would start paying off if you think	520.979	4.081
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	about it investing in the stock market	522.899	4.321
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	is just buying a little piece of an	525.06	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	asset someone else has created however	527.22	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	if you can get in on the ground floor by	529.44	3.899
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	investing your time and money into	531.6	4.08
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	building your own business then you'll	533.339	4.321
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	probably be able to generate far more	535.68	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	money the moral of the story is to make	537.66	4.859
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	sure you're doing both at the same time	540.06	5.94
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	step 5 use debt strategically a lot of	542.519	4.981
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	people aren't going to lie like this one	546.0	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	but being in debt isn't automatically a	547.5	5.64
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	bad thing let me explain if you want to	550.5	4.86
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	buy multiple properties to rent out and	553.14	4.379
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	generate passive income you might think	555.36	4.14
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	you have to save up a massive amount of	557.519	3.841
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	money but that's not necessarily the	559.5	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	case instead you can use debt	561.36	4.919
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	strategically to buy a house that's in a	564.0	4.8
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	bad condition this worst house in the	566.279	4.62
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	best street can be purchased for a lower	568.8	4.26
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	price let's say a hundred thousand	570.899	4.141
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	dollars then you can spend fifty	573.06	3.66
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	thousand dollars to fix it up and make	575.04	3.54

6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	after that you can refinance it for 75	578.58	6.42
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	of its new value which is a hundred and	581.88	5.28
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	fifty thousand dollars this way you can	585.0	3.899
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	use that hundred and fifty thousand	587.16	3.72
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	dollars to buy another property or	588.899	4.56
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	renovate another worst house and repeat	590.88	5.579
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	the process think of it as a real life	593.459	5.041
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	game of Monopoly but in order to do	596.459	3.721
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	something like this you'll need to have	598.5	3.959
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	a good credit score so if I was starting	600.18	4.56
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	from scratch I'd make sure to get a	602.459	4.141
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	credit card as soon as possible and	604.74	3.96
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	higher often forward the end of each and	606.6	4.14
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	every month in order to build my credit	608.7	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	score this is like a scorecard lenders	610.74	4.8
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	use to see how reliable you are I know	613.08	4.68
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	it seems crazy that you have to use debt	615.54	4.44
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	to be seen as reliable but that's just	617.76	3.96
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	the way it is so instead of thinking	619.98	3.96
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	that debt is always bad try to	621.72	4.2
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	understand how to use it to your	623.94	5.04
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	advantage step six don't spend earned	625.92	4.919
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	money when it comes to money there's a	628.98	3.72
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	common misconception that the more money	630.839	3.841
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	you make the more money you should spend	632.7	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	however this couldn't be further from	634.68	4.98
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	the truth in fact the key to having a	637.08	4.98
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	consistently great life is to spend only	639.66	4.739
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	what your Investment Portfolio yields	642.06	4.38
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	this is normally around eight to ten	644.399	3.601
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	percent I'm not saying to actually take	646.44	3.78
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	the money out of your investments just	648.0	4.14
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	to spend that percentage of your	650.22	4.08
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	earnings I know this can sound confusing	652.14	4.68
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	so for example if you have one million	654.3	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	dollars invested then you'd be able to	656.82	4.019
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	spend up to ten percent of that value	658.8	4.08
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	which is a hundred thousand dollars per	660.839	4.081
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	year from your earnings without having	662.88	4.139
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	to worry too much of course this just	664.92	4.32
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	rely on you making a lot but once you've	667.019	4.32
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	made it to step six this shouldn't be	669.24	3.839
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	too much of an issue think of it this	671.339	4.201
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	way every dollar you earn is like a seed	673.079	4.741
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	that you can plant and watch grow into a	675.54	4.919
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	money tree the more seeds you plant the	677.82	4.86
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	bigger your portfolio becomes and the	680.459	4.5
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	more money it will yield and just like a	682.68	4.56
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	tree if you take care of your portfolio	684.959	4.741
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	and only take the fruit it yields it	687.24	4.68
6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	will continue to grow and provide for	689.7	3.84

6IiEoSHw9gY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IiEoSHw9gY	what I learned from Reading over 40	693.54	3.539

i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	In the world of stock trading, its so easy 
to get overwhelmed and lost in the endless	0.0	4.92
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	abyss of information that s out there. 
There s free ebooks, paid courses, and scammy	4.92	5.7
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	youtubers. and its extremely hard to decipher what 
s good information and what s bad information.	10.62	8.46
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	As someone who has had to go through 
the exact same scenario myself.	19.08	3.704
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	(Yep that s me)
I found it extremely	22.784	1.576
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	annoying. So that s why im making this exact 
video. So you can cut out all the bullshit	24.36	4.5
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	and get a complete A-Z guide on how to start 
trading stocks if you are complete beginner.	28.86	4.86
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Now im not going to do the usual YouTuber approach 
where I wrap this all up in a nice little bow and	33.72	5.46
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	make you pay $299 for my course.
The best part of this series,	39.18	4.2
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	its completely free.
(free realestate)	43.38	2.34
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Now after trading for around 8 years, I can 
say there s a lot of information we have to	46.32	5.04
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	swim through. My job is to go over that 
information in a simplistic and efficient	51.36	4.32
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	way so you can understand the maximum amount 
of information possible in the shortest amount	55.68	5.04
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	of time. That s the goal at least.
Now theres a specific question I get	60.72	4.08
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	asked most almost every single day in my comment 
section from new traders. Trader after trader	64.8	5.22
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	asking the same, exact, question.
That question is .	70.02	4.98
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	How much money do I need to start trading?
And my answer, might just surprise you. Is	75.0	7.08
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	it $100? Is it $1,000? Is it $10,000? 
What if I told you the answer is $0.	82.08	12.72
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Let me explain. 
One of the biggest mistakes beginner traders make	98.22	3.84
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	is they just instantly jump in the market with 
their life savings without any experience at all.	102.06	4.98
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Just because they saw some Stock tiktok trader in 
front of a lambo and thought hey that looks fun .	107.04	5.46
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Considering they have no experience, they 
lose all of their money, then end up saying	112.5	4.26
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	ahh maybe this isn t for me . Then end up 
quitting, and never try to trade stocks again.	116.76	5.22
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	And the sad part is, this is what 
happens to a majority of traders.	126.54	4.08
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	What I m about to tell you, is how you 
can completely avoid that all together,	130.62	3.9
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	so this doesn t happen to you.
There are devices called trading simulators	134.52	4.44
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	or paper trading. Which is basically a platform 
where you can trade with fake money so you can	138.96	5.22
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	test things out. Test different strategies, 
test your risk management techniques, test	144.18	4.14
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	controlling your emotions, or maybe you want to 
test out different trading styles like shorting.	148.32	4.8
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Most new traders skip this step, and 
honestly its the most crucial step	153.12	4.56
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	out there to become a successful trader. 
That s why im listing it as my very step.	157.68	4.92
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	There are a lot of trading simulators out 
there. Some are paid, some are free. But	162.6	4.8
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	the one that I would recommend the most is 
webull. Just because its free and they have	167.4	4.56
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	a really user friendly dashboard to where 
its not really confusing and easy to use.	171.96	5.16
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	So that s what I would recommend if you want 
to try one out. Plus I think they give you,	184.74	3.78
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	12 free shares of stock or something like 
that if its your first time signing up,	188.52	3.66
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	so that s a good bonus as well.	192.18	1.5
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Ill leave a link in my description if you 
want to try out their trading simulator.	193.68	3.06
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	No, this video is not sponsored by webull. 
I just recommend them if you don t have a	196.74	4.26
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	trading simulator already. But webull 
if you re watching this cough cough.	201.0	3.96
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	So what I would recommend doing is 
getting on webull, start paper trading,	204.96	4.2
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	and just do what you would normally do 
if it was real money. But the trick is,	209.16	4.14
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	you have to act like this fake paper trading 
money is real. Act like its your actual capital.	213.3	5.22
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Put the concepts that im about to teach you in 
this video series to the test. But not only that,	218.52	5.58
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	take it a step further. Record 
every single trade you take.	224.1	3.78
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	If it was a losing trade. Write down what you 
think you did wrong. Did you get greedy? Did you	227.88	4.74
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	move your stop loss? Did you let your emotions get 
the best of you? Did you follow your rule set?	232.62	4.5
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Record EVERYTHING. For every single trade.
This way, you can look back at what you did	237.12	2.903
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	wrong and instantly fix it there and then. 
This will EXPONENTIALLY speed up the	240.023	3.397
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	process of you becoming a better trader.
But not only that, you should record all your	243.42	4.5
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	winning trades as well. Write down what you think 
you did right. That way, you can look back at it	247.92	4.62
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	and try to repeat the concepts you did right.
When first starting out, you should not be	252.54	3.96
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	focused on the money aspect of trading at 
all. You should purely be focusing on your	256.5	4.68
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	trading strategy, improving said strategy, 
and trying to learn as much as possible.	261.18	4.8
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	If you do all of this, the making 
money part, will just come naturally.	265.98	3.9
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Doing just this, will let you pass 100,000s 
of new traders on the learning curve.	269.88	5.94
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	This tip in itself is a game changer, im 
serious, every new trader should do it.	275.82	4.56
i5OZQQWj5-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OZQQWj5-I	Thats my first step, on how to start trading 
stocks a complete beginner. I was thinking about	280.38	4.44

from A-Z on how to become a successful trader.	284.82	5.76

management, trading psychology, chart setups,	290.58	5.16

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the Indian stock market I feel that the	29.939	4.741
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Indian markets are bottoming out I will	32.34	4.44
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	show you data points I am investing in	34.68	4.08
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the market now I had built some cash	36.78	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	positions in the last few months which I	38.76	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	have started to deploy already now this	40.5	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	is not a push from my side that you	42.48	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	should also go and invest your money but	44.28	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	hopefully by analyzing and understanding	46.44	4.02
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	this video and doing certain kind of	48.66	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	forecast you will be able to better	50.46	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	understand whatever is happening in the	52.5	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	market because most of the stock market	54.42	4.2
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	commentators they simply go and do	56.28	4.08
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	postmortem report when I was on talking	58.62	3.419
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	about adani four months back no one was	60.36	3.179
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	listening and now everyone is talking	62.039	3.361
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	about adani so right now there is a lot	63.539	3.841
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	of negative commentary but I am quite	65.4	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	hopeful about the markets this again	67.38	3.54
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	does not mean that you know what the	69.24	3.18
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	markets cannot fall by five ten percent	70.92	3.54
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	they of course can at any point in time	72.42	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	but generally from this stage I feel	74.46	4.019
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that it is better to be invested in	76.74	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Market rather than pulling your money	78.479	4.081
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	out of it so in order to understand this	80.52	4.2
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	entire context let me do a point wise	82.56	4.379
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	analysis so the first key point that you	84.72	4.079
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	need to understand is the historic Point	86.939	4.081
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	go three months back there was so much	88.799	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	negativity associated with two different	91.02	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	asset classes one is like cryptos people	93.119	4.261
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	were extremely negative and second there	95.34	4.319
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	was lot of negativity associated with	97.38	4.739
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	U.S stock market people were saying that	99.659	5.161
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	you know what Tesla stock space the Elon	102.119	4.741
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Musk sold his own stocks only so much	104.82	4.08
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	firing happening intake Tech was	106.86	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	overvalued it Rose so much after	108.9	3.48
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	pandemic there is hardly anything left	110.82	3.0
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	in Tech whatever right so I mean this	112.38	3.0
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	type of negative commentary was there	113.82	3.839
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	now take a look at this chart that in	115.38	4.519
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the last one month NASDAQ Composite has	117.659	5.82
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	increased by roughly 18 percent gain so	119.899	5.26
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the U.S stock market according to me	123.479	3.541
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	bottomed out roughly a month back and	125.159	3.6
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	this is a Community member post that I	127.02	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	made Talking specifically that I am	128.759	3.901
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	building aggressive positions in the U.S	130.92	3.36
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	stock market and my that entire	132.66	3.62
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	portfolio is massively in green	134.28	4.56
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	similarly lot of negative commentary	136.28	4.3
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	against cryptos now again I don't want	138.84	3.3
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	to touch upon this topic because this	140.58	3.48
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	becomes like a talking point for a lot	142.14	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	of people no fundamental value this that	144.06	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	and I categorically mentioned the fact	145.92	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that I'm building positions in Bitcoin	147.9	3.6

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	something that I have done and now	153.239	4.021
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Bitcoin is up roughly by 40 in the last	154.68	5.1
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	one month again you analyze crypto	157.26	4.8
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	oriented companies for example coinbase	159.78	5.52
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	it has been up by roughly 1995 in the	162.06	5.22
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	last one month so according to me a	165.3	4.019
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	massive bottoming out of U.S tech stock	167.28	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	had happened roughly one month back	169.319	3.541
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	similarly it had happened to a very	170.94	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	large extent in cryptos and right now	172.86	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that bottoming out scenario is playing	174.78	4.26
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	out in the Indian market so the lesson	176.58	4.439
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	being that if you feel that the markets	179.04	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	are bottoming out in India and if you	181.019	3.36

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	upcoming few months now again not a push	187.5	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	from my side this is not a Stock	189.9	3.24
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Investing recommendation this that I'm	191.22	3.54
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	honestly presenting a transparent	193.14	3.36

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	might have a natural response that as to	200.28	3.3
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	why you are saying that Indian markets	201.9	3.3
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	are bottoming out can you present some	203.58	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	data and Analysis around it so this is a	205.2	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	very important point and here you should	207.54	3.419
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	start making some notes so reason number	209.04	4.02
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	one why I feel that the Indian markets	210.959	4.261
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	are bottoming out is due to the time	213.06	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	correction that has happened in the	215.22	3.12
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	market so what do I mean by time	216.72	3.239
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	correction so for example this is the	218.34	3.959
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	nifty 50 chart and what you will see is	219.959	4.081
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that right now the markets are dancing	222.299	5.041
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	around 17 700 levels now when was this	224.04	5.339
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	level last there so in one and a half	227.34	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	years nifty 50 has given zero percent	229.379	6.92
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	return okay now you'll say corrections	231.72	6.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	two years return there is zero three	236.299	4.241
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	years written there is not much but it's	238.56	4.56
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	not as if that over a course of four or	240.54	4.5
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	five years the stock market return will	243.12	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	be close to zero why would that not be	245.04	3.779
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the case so think about it this way that	246.84	3.599
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	you are getting seven seven and a half	248.819	3.961
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	percent returns when you go and do fixed	250.439	5.461
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	deposits now if you keep on getting zero	252.78	4.799
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	percent return from the stock market for	255.9	3.42
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	one year maybe you'll be okay for two	257.579	4.021
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	years maybe by third year you will lose	259.32	4.319
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	your patience you'll simply say that the	261.6	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	stock market game is useless your mummy	263.639	3.181
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	and papa are going to say that both of	265.44	3.18
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	your stock market value is now just	266.82	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	simply go and do fixed deposit or buy a	268.62	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	land or whatever it is right so to cut	270.6	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the long story short if people do not	272.52	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	make Equity returns over a period of two	274.5	4.8
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	to three years it is very very unlikely	276.84	4.2
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that they are going to stay in the	279.3	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	equity Market people do not bother too	281.04	4.62
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	much from a long term perspective for	283.68	4.019
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	them long term means two three years if	285.66	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	people are not making returns from the	287.699	3.961

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	zero percent returns if in another one	296.4	4.92

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that will drop off from the market	303.72	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	almost permanently now you might have a	305.28	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	natural question that accept Okay all	307.44	3.12

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	reason is the chest thumping so for	382.319	3.361
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	example says something means that if the	384.18	3.299

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	are benefiting there is General positive	402.36	3.779
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	outlook in the economy so how do you	404.22	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	measure all this so the one data point	406.139	3.961
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	very important data point is the GDP	408.06	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	which is the macroeconomy related data	410.1	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	point and second most important data	411.96	3.959
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	point is the sensex or Nifty returns	413.94	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that people are making this becomes a	415.919	3.361
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	fairly important consideration for the	417.6	3.18
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	government this second key reason is	419.28	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that investor sentiment needs to be kept	420.78	4.5
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	High especially the foreign players you	423.06	3.96

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	even prime minister their cabinet	429.24	3.12
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	members they keep on saying that it's	430.919	3.12
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	very important for India to get foreign	432.36	3.059
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	investors now when will foreign	434.039	3.121
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	investors come when they see the scope	435.419	3.601
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	of making money when will they see it	437.16	3.659
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	when there is actual return happening in	439.02	4.2
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the Indian market so this data point of	440.819	4.201
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	keeping the stock market alive is very	443.22	4.02
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	very important third without belaboring	445.02	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	too much think it just generally creates	447.24	3.54
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	a very positive environment domestically	448.8	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	people feel happy if they are making	450.78	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	more money and the best part about stock	452.52	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	market is that the returns can be	454.44	4.08
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	dragged very very easily on the flip	456.24	5.22
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	side if you go and buy a home it's very	458.52	4.619
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	difficult to keep a track of how much	461.46	3.54
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	price movement of home would be moreover	463.139	4.141
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	there are more taxations associated in	465.0	4.139
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	terms of selling or buying a house for	467.28	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	example there is an 8 to 12 percent	469.139	3.721
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	stamp Duty in terms of buying real	470.94	3.659
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	estate similarly there are a lot of	472.86	3.179
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	commissions involved if you are buying	474.599	3.061
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	any other type of physical asset for	476.039	4.021
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	example gold silver all that stuff so to	477.66	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	cut the long story short stock market	480.06	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	sentiments are extremely important or	481.62	4.139
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	one of the most important things that	483.72	4.259
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	government actively looks to control so	485.759	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	two very important points that you have	487.979	3.06
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	studied so far that number one the	489.479	3.06
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Indian stock market has not given	491.039	2.821
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	returns over the last one and a half	492.539	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	years and if it takes another six months	493.86	3.959
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	of recovery then we are looking at two	496.259	3.421
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	years of zero returns which is a fairly	497.819	3.241
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	High Time correction that has happened	499.68	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	second thing a lot of retail investors	501.06	4.68
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	are already dropping the third key Point	503.58	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	why the Indian stock market is bottoming	505.74	4.139
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	out right now is that there is a big	507.96	4.139
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	bomb that has exploded there is some	509.879	4.561
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	kind of mega event that is associated in	512.099	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	terms of bottoming out of anything for	514.44	4.8
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	example in 2008 what was that mega event	516.479	5.761
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	it was the financial crisis in 2020 what	519.24	5.219
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	was the bottoming out event kovid what	522.24	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	was the bottoming out event in the	524.459	3.901
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	crypto Market it was the collapse of FTX	526.02	4.02
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	which was the second largest centralized	528.36	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	exchange what was the bottoming out in	530.04	4.14
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the U.S market it was the massive layoff	532.2	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	and Elon Musk selling his own Tesla	534.18	4.02
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	stocks so that according to me was a	536.58	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	bottoming out event when it came to tech	538.2	4.139
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	stocks and bigwig companies like Amazon	540.3	4.62
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	connected by 30 40 you had Microsoft	542.339	5.281
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	correct by 30 35 and now all these	544.92	4.26
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	companies are rising so something	547.62	3.6
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	similar is currently happening in the	549.18	4.56
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Indian market where the poster child of	551.22	4.5
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Indian stock market which is the adani	553.74	4.14
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	group of companies they are exploding	555.72	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	this is a hyper local event for example	557.88	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	adanis have very little exposure outside	560.1	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	India compared to within India so this	562.2	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	is a local event for the Indian market	564.42	4.02
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	and if the Indian market to whatever	566.16	4.619
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	levels it falls for example let's say we	568.44	5.22
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	are right now at 17 800 Nifty levels we	570.779	5.041
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	might fall to let's say 17 000 then that	573.66	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	becomes the bottom of the Indian market	575.82	4.139
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	or a very very strong bottom so this	577.56	4.2
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	situation is going to clear it very	579.959	3.481
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	quickly over the next couple of months	581.76	4.079
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	to what extent athani stocks going to	583.44	4.86
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	fall and what would be the impact on the	585.839	4.141
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Indian market so this brings us to a	588.3	3.06
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	natural question that actually you said	589.98	3.0
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that the markets are bottoming out and	591.36	3.24
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	adani group of companies right now are	592.98	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	exploding so how can you be sure that	594.6	4.02
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Rani group of companies will not lose	596.7	4.56
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	more market value That's A and B how can	598.62	4.44
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	you be sure that the Indian stock market	601.26	4.079
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	overall will not fall now see I can't be	603.06	4.2
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	sure but I can do some kind of scenario	605.339	4.201
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	analysis so there are two scenarios	607.26	4.44
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	which are likely to take place from this	609.54	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	point the two scenarios would be that	611.7	3.12
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	number one there is going to be a	613.44	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	partial crisis and the second scenario	614.82	4.199
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	would be a full-blown crisis so let me	617.1	3.6
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	explain that and then let me walk you	619.019	3.421
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	through it so the partial case scenario	620.7	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	is already underway for example a report	622.44	3.899
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	by Hindenburg has come out I will link	624.6	3.299
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	my video in case you have not watched it	626.339	3.0
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	so you will understand the entire	627.899	3.541

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	what Market is believing this is not	634.98	3.479
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	what my opinion is and therefore you are	636.42	4.68

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	somewhat believes that you know what the	643.38	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	adaniji's group of response hasn't been	645.12	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	too good it is somewhat bad and they	647.22	4.2
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	have also issued caution on it for	649.5	4.079
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	example you had msci index that I said	651.42	4.26
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	negative stuff about the adani group you	653.579	3.661
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	had Credit Suisse which I said negative	655.68	3.18
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	stuff U.S City Bank that is said	657.24	3.36
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	negative stuff so a bunch of	658.86	3.479
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	international players are now saying	660.6	3.299
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	negative stuff about adani group of	662.339	3.301
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	companies now you might respond that you	663.899	2.761
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	know what this is like internationally	665.64	2.819
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	motivated I don't want to get into all	666.66	3.48
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	this politics this is what big	668.459	3.601
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	International institutions outside India	670.14	4.08
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	has said that also had somewhat of a	672.06	4.86
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	direct to indirect exposure in the atani	674.22	4.2
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	group of stocks so they are probably	676.92	3.659
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	making their money oriented decisions so	678.42	4.62
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	this partial crisis is already underway	680.579	5.281
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	and we have seen 50 60 correction on	683.04	5.16
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	adani group of stocks now has this	685.86	4.68
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	created a massive impact on the overall	688.2	4.62
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Indian Equity market so the short answer	690.54	5.22
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	there is no not majorly Nifty right now	692.82	5.639
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	is trading at 17 800 when I am shooting	695.76	5.22
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	this video on Friday so this is not a	698.459	4.56
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	massive correction by any measure you	700.98	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	will have a natural response now that	703.019	3.661
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	you know what fine agree that this is a	704.76	4.68
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	partial crisis but can it go to this	706.68	4.62
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	full-blown zone so what would a	709.44	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	full-blown crisis look like okay so this	711.3	4.74
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	is where it can start for example if CB	713.22	4.679
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	and Regulators come out and say that you	716.04	3.359
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	know what something wrong with the adani	717.899	3.541
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	group of companies that will again	719.399	4.201
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	trigger the market very likely that the	721.44	4.019
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Indian markets will fall second key	723.6	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	thing that the government indicates that	725.459	3.241
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	they are going to form some kind of	727.44	3.12
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	committees they are looking more into it	728.7	3.54
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	some kind of official statement comes	730.56	3.24
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	into it whether this is going to happen	732.24	3.06
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	not going to happen I'm not going to	733.8	3.42
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	comment on that but this is how usually	735.3	3.539
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	it works out that some kind of joint	737.22	3.059
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	parliamentary committee will be formed	738.839	3.361
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	they might uncover some details and it	740.279	3.901
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	might lead to bad bad stuff third and	742.2	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	final problem would be that these	744.18	3.899
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Regulators these government oriented	745.98	4.919
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	agencies find some kind of Mark or dirt	748.079	5.221
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	within the adani group and that can lead	750.899	4.56
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	to a massive internal crisis within the	753.3	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	adani group so the stocks might even	755.459	3.661
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	fall to like I don't know 80 90 or	757.26	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	whatever and that might create like a	759.12	4.08
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	snowball effect so in that scenario of	760.92	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	course the adani group of companies are	763.2	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	going to get massively hurt but the	764.82	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	chances are that there can be outright	767.16	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	loan default problems which might seep	769.2	4.079
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	into the market for example a lot of	771.06	4.26
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	banks have given loans to arani for	773.279	3.721
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	example SBI they have given loans to	775.32	3.36
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	adani group they might take that bad	777.0	3.899
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	debt exposure now good thing is that as	778.68	4.44
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	per this tweet SBI does not have a	780.899	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	massive exposure to the adani group so	783.12	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	far no bank has said that we have had a	785.279	4.201
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	lot of exposure to the adani group now I	787.44	3.6
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	can't comment on the veracity of this	789.48	3.479
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	data but so far the market is believing	791.04	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	in this narrative that the Indian Banks	792.959	4.741
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	do not have a massive exposure to adani	794.88	5.1
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	group which is a very very good sign and	797.7	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	therefore I am saying that the Indian	799.98	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	markets are bottoming out bottoming out	801.42	4.859
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	means that it has formed a base it is	803.94	3.899
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	very unlikely that it is going to fall	806.279	3.601
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	massively from this point now one point	807.839	3.841
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that no one is talking about the adani	809.88	3.54
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	group and our government's ability to	811.68	4.44
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	handle crisis has nothing to do with our	813.42	4.56
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	government per se but it is generally	816.12	3.899
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	how the governments control the	817.98	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	financial market so to say a	820.019	3.601
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	classification point is the ever Grand	821.94	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	crisis so if you go back roughly six	823.62	3.959
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	seven months back there was a crisis in	825.6	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	China called as ever Grant crisis so it	827.579	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	was a very big real estate player it had	829.92	4.2
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	a lot of exposure to date it had so much	831.899	4.62
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	exposure to debt that the Chinese Banks	834.12	4.68
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	or Chinese state-owned Banks they had a	836.519	4.921
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	lot of exposure to that date so it was	838.8	4.26
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	being said that you know what the ever	841.44	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Grant crisis is going to collapse China	843.06	4.92
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	and the Chinese talk suffered locally	845.82	4.079
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	for three four five months and then what	847.98	4.08
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	now the Chinese stocks are doing fairly	849.899	3.961
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	well so the summary point is very simple	852.06	3.839
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that if the Chinese government wants to	853.86	3.539
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	control their Market they will control	855.899	3.361
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	their Market it's as simple as that	857.399	3.961
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	everything is tied to money printing now	859.26	3.42
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	I'm not saying that Indian market	861.36	2.88
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	functions exactly like the Chinese	862.68	4.02
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	market but we have to agree to the point	864.24	5.279
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that the Indian government also exerts a	866.7	4.62
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	lot of influence on the financial Market	869.519	3.661
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	in India you would have seen that you	871.32	3.6
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	know what with one announcement RBI can	873.18	3.599
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	derail like fintech companies with	874.92	3.719
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	another announcement in the budget the	876.779	3.36
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	insurance companies took a lot of	878.639	3.301
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	beating so to cut the long story short	880.139	4.021
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the financial markets are very heavily	881.94	4.139
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	regulated control by the governments now	884.16	4.02
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	whether we like it or not which is also	886.079	3.841
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	a good news because if you are generally	888.18	3.779
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	optimistic in the market you can be sure	889.92	3.539
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that the government will do everything	891.959	3.301
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	in its power to bring the markets back	893.459	3.781
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	because it creates a lot of headache for	895.26	3.72
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	them in case the markets goes down	897.24	3.42
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	aggressively and there is Widespread	898.98	3.479
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Panic so now comes the final section	900.66	3.6
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	where I will talk about that if you do	902.459	3.24
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	believe in this bottoming out scenario	904.26	3.6
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	for the Indian market then how you can	905.699	3.721
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	make money and what are some of the key	907.86	3.419
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	points that you should remember so Point	909.42	3.599
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	number one that you should remember is	911.279	3.661
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that you don't get too attached with the	913.019	4.38
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	adani group game just don't try to catch	914.94	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	a falling knife that you know what a	917.399	3.44
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	running group companies are falling	918.6	4.679
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	well they can go to absolute zero also	920.839	4.541
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	in case some kind of Mark gets uncovered	923.279	4.321
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	so please don't believe in this catching	925.38	3.899
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the following Night Theory catching the	927.6	3.359

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	type of stocks I'm looking to purchase	968.16	3.419
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	and what type of assets I'm precisely	969.779	3.781
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	buying Point number two the adani story	971.579	4.141
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	is going to impact our broader Market no	973.56	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	doubt about that in the short term it is	975.72	3.54
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	a very high likelihood that even the	977.88	3.0
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Indian market might fall by five ten	979.26	3.42
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	percent I don't know but I can say it	980.88	3.24
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	with a very high degree of certainty	982.68	3.3
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that if you take a look at four or five	984.12	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	years of nifty returns tagger will come	985.98	4.859
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	out to be at least 12 percent that has	988.44	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	not happened in the last one and a half	990.839	3.661
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	two years so that means that the deficit	992.1	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	in the gains will be made up over the	994.5	3.6
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	next two to three years if you have that	996.42	3.539
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Vision if you have that Clarity then go	998.1	3.84
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	ahead and invest figure out good stocks	999.959	3.841
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	to buy so then comes the natural third	1001.94	3.42
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	point that okay what are good stocks to	1003.8	3.18

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	because then you will hold me morally	1006.98	3.299
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	responsible for making those stocks go	1008.36	3.899
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	up from tomorrow so I will not do that	1010.279	3.36
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	but I will give you a basic	1012.259	3.0
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	understanding that please do not buy	1013.639	4.32
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	high debt companies because if the adani	1015.259	4.741
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	thing blows up if adani groups goes down	1017.959	4.44
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	or suffers badly a lot of banks will	1020.0	4.199
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	become little bit more iffy in terms of	1022.399	3.721
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	giving out loans to others small	1024.199	3.6
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	businesses so they will suffer	1026.12	3.6
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	especially the businesses that require a	1027.799	4.14
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	lot of capex stay away from them they	1029.72	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	will find it increasingly harder to	1031.939	3.541
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	refinance their debt why would that be	1033.62	3.48
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the case because in case the adani thing	1035.48	3.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	blows up then the government will come	1037.1	4.4
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	out with a set of new regulations	1039.14	5.159
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	and all that stuff so credit flow slows	1041.5	4.66
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	down so that really impacts businesses	1044.299	4.081
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that are already on high debt then comes	1046.16	3.96
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the final point that please stay	1048.38	4.08
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Diversified this is a single sentence	1050.12	4.26
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that I keep on saying on almost all my	1052.46	3.719
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	videos then I get the counter argument	1054.38	4.08
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that you know what akshat that Mr Warren	1056.179	4.561
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Buffett has 40 of his portfolio in Apple	1058.46	3.78
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	stock this that he's a highly	1060.74	3.36
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	concentrated investor do you know more	1062.24	4.02
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	than him no I do not but Mr Warren	1064.1	4.199
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	Buffett is not a retail investor he can	1066.26	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	afford to have a concentrated portfolio	1068.299	3.841
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	because he has access to Tim Cook	1070.16	4.379
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	directly if he needs Clarity on some	1072.14	4.68
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	information he can call up Tim Cook if	1074.539	3.781
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	people like you and I even reach out to	1076.82	3.42
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	product managers at Apple it is unlikely	1078.32	3.42
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that they will pick our phone so for	1080.24	3.24
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	retail investors our investing style	1081.74	3.66

YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	are goldfish don't try to be a shark so	1085.4	3.54
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	that's a simple message that I will	1087.62	3.24
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	leave you with hope this video gives you	1088.94	3.9
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	a lot of confidence if it did do press	1090.86	3.3
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	the like button and share it with your	1092.84	4.64
YhIU8_Dz4aU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIU8_Dz4aU	friends and I will see you soon	1094.16	3.32
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the artificial intelligence Market is	0.0	3.78
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	estimated to grow at a compounding rate	1.979	4.081
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	of 34 percent over the next decade and	3.78	4.5
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the expected value is nearly 16 trillion	6.06	4.26
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	dollars by 2030. I think that we all	8.28	4.02
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	realize this is going to be a tsunami of	10.32	3.96
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	innovation because AI is going to touch	12.3	3.6
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	every industry and it's going to cause	14.28	3.66
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	us to adjust how we create View and	15.9	4.08
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	absorb information moving forward that's	17.94	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	why I'm going to discuss the top 10	19.98	3.54
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Stock that are in position to gain the	21.66	3.24
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	most from the boom of artificial	23.52	3.179
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	intelligence actually it's going to be	24.9	3.719
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	hard to narrow it down to 10 so I'm	26.699	3.061
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	going to provide a list of the	28.619	2.941
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	runner-ups at the end so you can see all	29.76	3.18
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the different companies that I reviewed	31.56	3.48
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	in this research so you can capitalize	32.94	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	on the estimated compounding growth of	35.04	4.56
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	34 a year for the next decade for now	36.84	4.62
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	let's get started with Nvidia which	39.6	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	happens to be a manufacturer of graphics	41.46	4.56
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	cards and complex chips but they do so	43.44	4.56
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	much more a main reason that they have	46.02	4.32
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	so much to gain from AI is that we all	48.0	4.26
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	know that AI is a set of algorithms made	50.34	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	up within a package program and there	52.26	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	are a lot of software companies creating	54.18	4.019
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	these programs but in order for them to	55.98	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	grow and scale they need Hardware like	58.199	4.321
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	nvidia's gpus to be the backbone of the	60.42	4.379
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	computing power in order to digest all	62.52	4.62
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	those vast amounts of data not only are	64.799	4.561
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	they a leader in Hardware but they also	67.14	4.019
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	offer generative AI models for	69.36	3.6
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Enterprise use for companies to build	71.159	3.721
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	out their own Solutions and this is	72.96	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	called their Nemo service they are also	74.88	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	partnering with Medtronic to create an	77.4	4.2
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	AI platform for software-defined medical	79.32	4.92
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	devices using nvidia's proprietary	81.6	4.74
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Hollow scan my point is that Nvidia is	84.24	3.6
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	creating Partnerships across several	86.34	3.12
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	different Industries and those are all	87.84	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	industries that will fuel massive growth	89.46	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	over the next several years that will	91.74	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	make Nvidia a key company to invest in	93.18	5.16
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	as a comparison year to date the S P 500	95.46	6.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	is up 8.3 percent while Nvidia is up	98.34	6.48
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	95.2 percent it offers a dividend of 16	101.6	5.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	cents a share and the current price	104.82	4.799
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	today is at 285 dollars and the	106.74	4.5
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	consensus among the analysts is that	109.619	3.601
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	it's a buy now we'll move on to the next	111.24	4.199
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	stock of Microsoft which everyone knows	113.22	3.96
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the company and it's really difficult to	115.439	4.021
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	share anything new but they have created	117.18	4.2
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	some true true disruption when they	119.46	3.659
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	included Chachi BT into their Bing	121.38	3.66
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	search engine Google has owned the	123.119	3.96
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	search engine space for years with a 90	125.04	4.68
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	share and Microsoft's inclusion of chat	127.079	4.8
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	gbt has started up conversations with	129.72	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Samsung to make being the default	131.879	3.481
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	browser for their new phones granted	133.62	3.66
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	this is a small step for Microsoft	135.36	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	they're also incorporating AI into	137.28	4.319
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Office 365 to be more like an assistant	139.26	5.58
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	called Microsoft 365 co-pilot but I	141.599	5.161
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	promise you it is much better than the	144.84	4.5
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	1995 clippy but I expect that Microsoft	146.76	4.32
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	will be completely renovating office	149.34	3.479

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	their main input versus radar because	436.56	4.02

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	years I think the Tesla in some ways is	445.74	4.5
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	a bit misunderstood by most of us and	448.08	4.08
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	what I mean by that is that we all see	450.24	3.959
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the shiny object of the Tesla cars that	452.16	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	are right there in front of us but in	454.199	4.081
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	some ways I see it as misdirection the	455.88	4.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	cars are literally a vehicle for	458.28	4.02
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	training Ai and everyone that buys a	460.02	4.14

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	be ahead of the competition because they	468.539	3.6

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	software to other manufacturers I	493.68	4.5

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	profits getting turned around and I	556.08	3.48

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	now that they have competitors they're	559.56	3.66
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	also making that push most recently	561.12	4.86
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	meta's performance was up 100.4 percent	563.22	4.799
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	year to date where analysts continue to	565.98	4.5
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	have it as a buy I'll now follow that up	568.019	4.861
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	with another small company called Arista	570.48	3.84

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	computer servers in the data centers	579.839	4.321
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	these switches happen to be the backbone	581.64	4.379
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	system to some degree for companies like	584.16	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Microsoft and meta which happen to be	586.019	4.861
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	arista's two largest customers and with	588.06	5.399
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	both those customers on the top AI list	590.88	4.56
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	it only makes sense that Arista will	593.459	3.961
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	need to scale and grow with them this is	595.44	3.36
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	one of those companies that isn't a	597.42	3.599
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	driving force for or AI but they are a	598.8	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	necessary partner for the companies that	601.019	3.181
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	are creating the AI systems that are	602.64	3.24
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	going to require constant upgrades to	604.2	3.48
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	their infrastructure and that's where	605.88	4.019
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Arista comes into play to date their	607.68	4.02
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	performance is up 31.4 percent	609.899	3.541
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	year-to-date where they offer no	611.7	3.96

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	around 37 percent for 2023 but please	619.74	5.58
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	take that with a grain of salt now on to	622.92	4.56
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the next big AI stock which happens to	625.32	4.26
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	be a big one and also happens to be my	627.48	4.38
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	prior employer Amazon I will reference	629.58	4.02
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	all details about Amazon based on	631.86	3.599
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	publicly available knowledge but I can	633.6	3.48
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	tell you that I used to beta test many	635.459	3.301
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	of the hardware and the software systems	637.08	3.42

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	customers to tap into the foundational	656.7	3.9

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	modeling to the masses then they also	664.56	4.26
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	offer code Whisperer that's another AI	666.42	4.74

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	but with regards to the end consumer	676.32	4.74
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Amazon will continue to leverage AI with	678.36	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	their retail offerings and suggested	681.06	3.66
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	product and to approve upon their ad	682.8	3.539
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	platform for their vendors the company	684.72	3.54

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	market and taking another angle Amazon	691.62	4.32
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	has their cashless shopping experience	693.779	4.021
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	that they are expanding and Licensing	695.94	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	outside of their own stores not all that	697.8	3.96
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	different from what I was suggesting	700.38	3.0
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Tesla could do one day with their own	701.76	3.6
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	autonomous driving software but another	703.38	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	area that not many people are speaking	705.36	4.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	to is Project Kuiper which is a program	707.22	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	to develop and launch their own set of	709.5	4.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	satellites to provide fast affordable	711.66	3.96
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	internet around the world and the reason	713.64	3.96
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	that's important is because they're an	715.62	3.959
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	online business between their AWS and	717.6	3.78
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	their Amazon retail so if they can	719.579	3.541
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	expand their Base by providing Internet	721.38	3.66
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	to the masses then they're simply	723.12	3.36
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	gaining more consumers into their own	725.04	3.72
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	ecosystem they have a lot of irons in	726.48	4.2
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the fire but the law of averages say	728.76	3.12
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	that they're going to have a few winners	730.68	3.06
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	here and there currently Amazon's	731.88	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	performance is up 21.2 percent	733.74	4.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	year-to-date where analysts have it as a	735.72	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	buy with about a 40 upside for the year	737.88	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	and the next company for the top AI	740.16	5.28
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	stock is tsmc which is similar to Nvidia	742.32	5.22
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	in that they make semiconductors however	745.44	4.38
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the key difference is that tsmc has over	747.54	4.14
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	50 percent of the market share and	749.82	4.019
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	clearly brings in more Revenue than all	751.68	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	other manufacturers combined most all	753.839	3.421
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	other companies that I've talked about	756.12	4.08
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	today utilize tsmc product in some form	757.26	5.16
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	or fashion there's just no way around it	760.2	4.68
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	from a point of valuation the price to	762.42	5.159
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	earnings for tsmc is at 23x versus	764.88	6.48
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	nvidia's at 131x which makes tsmc a	767.579	5.76
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	better bet financially for stock growth	771.36	4.2
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	however with them being located in	773.339	4.201
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Taiwan there's a serious concern with	775.56	3.959
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	China's desire to overtake Taiwan by	777.54	3.84
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	force and when you look at the chart I	779.519	3.901
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	showed earlier with tsmc making up over	781.38	5.1
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	50 share of semiconductors if China took	783.42	5.34
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	over Taiwan then they could cut out all	786.48	3.9
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	of these semiconductors from all of the	788.76	3.54
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	western Nations and that's why the Us	790.38	4.139
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	and other countries are so interested in	792.3	3.96
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	Taiwan being able to defend themselves	794.519	4.44
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	the current performance of tsmc is up	796.26	5.04
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	9.7 percent year-to-date where their	798.959	4.44

PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	an analysts have it as a consistent buy	803.399	3.601
PWbEkenszec	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbEkenszec	rating where they see upside of around	805.32	4.74

SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	There is no such thing
as a joint Roth IRA.	46.62	3.0
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	So if you and your spouse
want to contribute to one,	49.62	2.82
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	then you'll have to do it individually,	52.44	2.07
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	hence the name Individual
Retirement Account.	54.51	2.73
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	If you both have enough
earned income separately,	57.24	2.59
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	then you can each invest up	59.83	1.94
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to the $6500 limit for the year.	61.77	2.64
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	If one of you works and the other doesn't,	64.41	2.04
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	but you file a joint tax return,	66.45	1.762
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	then the person working can, of course,	68.212	2.438
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	contribute to a Roth IRA and
your spouse can contribute	70.65	3.96
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to a Spousal Roth IRA as well.	74.61	2.19
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Remember, these accounts are
owned by the individual person	76.8	2.845
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and on paper, not co-owned by both people.	79.645	3.605
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I want to try to encourage you to max out	83.25	1.622
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	your Roth IRA every single year,	84.872	3.058
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	if possible, because if you
don't do it for that year,	87.93	2.34
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	then in the future you
cannot go back and contribute	90.27	3.06
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	for a previous year	93.33	1.62
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	once that time limit has passed.	94.95	1.77
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	A Roth IRA is one of those accounts	96.72	2.13
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	where I would bend over backwards	98.85	2.07
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to make sure that I can
put in the full amount	100.92	2.43
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	allowed every single year.	103.35	1.44
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	In my order of operations for
what to do with your money,	104.79	2.91
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I have maxing out a Roth
IRA right after investing up	107.7	3.87
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to your employer match and HSA.	111.57	2.55
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	That is how important
this type of account is.	114.12	2.52
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	The good news with this
is that you actually	116.64	2.22
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	have a timeframe of 16
months to contribute	118.86	3.51
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	for each calendar year.	122.37	1.32
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	So if we are in 2023
right now, then you have	123.69	2.688
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	from January 1st, 2023, up until
when taxes need to be filed	126.378	5.0
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	for that year to contribute,
which in this case,	131.88	3.0
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	would be April 15th, 2024.	134.88	2.43
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	That's how it is every single year,	137.31	1.98
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	so ignore the actual dates in my example	139.29	2.245
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and pay more attention to the timeframes	141.535	2.915
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	since the date taxes are due
will change by a few days	144.45	3.48
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	from year to year.	147.93	0.833
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Most brokerages will ask
you which year you want	148.763	2.707
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to contribute to.	151.47	1.08
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	For example, I personally
invest using M1 Finance,	152.55	3.66
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	which you can check out down
in the description below,	156.21	2.49
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and also get a deposit bonus as well.	158.7	2.13
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	If I contributed to my Roth
IRA through them right now,	160.83	3.54
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	then they would ask if I wanted the money	164.37	1.89
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to go towards 2022 or 2023,	166.26	3.034
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	since at the time of recording this,	169.294	2.786
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	we haven't hit the date
where taxes are due.	172.08	2.43
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	This is great because it
gives you some extra time	174.51	2.37
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	beyond the current year to
contribute Roth IRA money	176.88	3.69
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	for that year.	180.57	0.833
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Before I tell you the next mistake	181.403	1.357
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	that I see way too many people making,	182.76	2.181
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	please help support my dog Molly	184.941	2.019
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	by hitting that thumbs up
button and sharing this video	186.96	2.428
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	with anyone you think it would help.	189.388	1.892
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Once you deposit money	191.28	1.17
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	into your Roth IRA,	192.45	1.44
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	there's one more extremely important step	193.89	2.331
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	you need to do that I see a ton	196.221	2.298
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	of people missing, and that is
actually investing the money.	198.519	3.621
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I can't tell you how
many people I've talked	202.14	1.522
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to over the years who just put money	203.662	2.648
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	into the account assuming
it would automatically grow,	206.31	3.39
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	or knowing that they
needed to invest the money,	209.7	2.85
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	but just forgetting to do
it because life happens,	212.55	2.417
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and things naturally slip out of our mind,	214.967	2.533
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	only to check their account
balance years later,	217.5	2.373
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	realizing that it hasn't grown in value	219.873	2.153
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	because they didn't invest the money.	222.026	2.134
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Stop the nonsense here and
just set up auto investing	224.16	2.826
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	within your investment account,	226.986	1.821
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and if you're waiting because you think	228.807	1.863
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	that you can time the market
to buy in at a lower price,	230.67	2.484
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	you can't, because it's
nearly impossible to do,	233.154	3.816
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	so just to get the money
invested right now.	236.97	2.49
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	If you know how you want to
invest the money, then great.	239.46	2.61
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	If you don't, then I personally
like the two fund portfolio	242.07	3.457
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	for people who are in
the accumulation phase	245.527	2.753
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	of investing and in the
three fund portfolio	248.28	3.03
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	for when you're closer to
retirement or in retirement.	251.31	2.808
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I'll have a link to a
playlist then I made just	254.118	2.38
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	for you where I teach you
about both of those portfolios	256.498	3.662
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	down in the description below
and above my head as well.	260.16	2.58
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	When you contribute to a Roth IRA,	262.74	2.22
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	all of your money is not
locked up until 59.5.	264.96	3.491
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	You can withdraw the
contributions that you've made	268.451	2.839
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	before that age without paying a penalty,	271.29	2.589
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	but you cannot withdraw any of
the gains within the account.	273.879	4.041
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	For example, if you've contributed $6500	277.92	3.0
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and the account has grown to $10,000,	280.92	2.94
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	then you can withdraw
the $6500 contribution,	283.86	3.69
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	but you cannot touch the $3500 gain	287.55	3.45
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	without paying a penalty until 59.5.	291.0	3.21
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I've gotta interject for a second	294.21	1.56
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to give my personal opinion on this.	295.77	2.37
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	While withdrawing money
penalty-free is an option,	298.14	3.42
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I want to encourage you not to do this.	301.56	2.49
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	To be brutally honest,	304.05	1.74
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I think that doing this
is one of the dumbest,	305.79	2.73
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	most irresponsible, short-sighted
things that you can do.	308.52	3.51
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Withdrawing just $6500
worth of contributions	312.03	3.87
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	would cost you $65,000 in
future investment growth.	315.9	4.74
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	So when any money is
taken out of this account	320.64	1.911
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	before retirement, think
about how it's actually going	322.551	2.957
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to cost you 7,800 Chipotle burritos,	325.508	3.682
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	or 65 new Apple iPhones,	329.19	2.46
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	or anything else that you would buy	331.65	1.8
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	for that amount of money.	333.45	0.96
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	And yes, I am fully aware
that you can do a penalty-free	334.41	3.463
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	early withdrawal up to
$10,000 before the age	337.873	4.157
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	of 59.5 for a first time home purchase.	342.03	3.72
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	But this is just as stupid as withdrawing	345.75	2.19
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	your contributions early
because that $10,000	347.94	3.6
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	is costing you over $100,000
in future investment growth	351.54	5.0
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	when you pull that money out.	356.94	1.32
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Average annual home appreciation	358.26	1.95
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	over the past 12 years has been 6.11%,	360.21	3.777
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and the US stock market
has returned 12.27%.	363.987	4.803
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Leave your money in the freaking Roth IRA	368.79	2.67
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and go earn that $10,000 that
you need to buy the home.	371.46	3.36
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Responsible investing takes time,	374.82	2.19
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	like five or 10-plus years,	377.01	2.28
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and this money needs time to grow.	379.29	2.67
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	The second you withdraw
any of your contributions,	381.96	3.3
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	you are cutting down that tree	385.26	1.59
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	before it even has a chance to grow fruit.	386.85	2.011
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Once you withdraw
contributions from the past,	388.861	2.909
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	you cannot replace that
money in the future.	391.77	2.85
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I get that emergencies happen in life,	394.62	2.31
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	so that's why you need
to have money set aside	396.93	2.28
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	in an emergency fund to
pay for those things.	399.21	3.06
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Do not, under 99.999% of circumstances,	402.27	5.0
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	use your Roth IRA money for anything	407.31	2.534
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	other than when you retire.	409.844	1.846
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	One thing I see way too many people doing	411.69	2.19
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	is investing in a
taxable brokerage account	413.88	3.0
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	before they have their Roth
IRA maxed out for the year.	416.88	2.85
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	This is a huge mistake	419.73	1.38
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	from a tax savings
perspective for some of you	421.11	2.73
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	because of how each account is taxed.	423.84	2.01
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	With a Roth IRA,	425.85	1.02
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	you invest with money
that's already been taxed,	426.87	2.61
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	so the money can grow tax-free
and be withdrawn tax-free.	429.48	3.81
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	With a taxable brokerage
account, you are paying taxes	433.29	2.514
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	for the ongoing dividend
distributions every single year.	435.804	3.966
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Then you have to pay capital gains tax	439.77	2.55
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	when you go to withdraw the money.	442.32	1.53
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Since the money within
a Roth IRA will grow	443.85	2.55
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and can be withdrawn tax-free,	446.4	1.845
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	realistically, you want
this account to get	448.245	2.595
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	as large as possible,	450.84	1.5
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	but not at the expense of
your personal risk tolerance.	452.34	3.479
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	You should not take on
additional levels of risk	455.819	2.555
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	by investing in more
risky, unprofitable stocks	458.374	3.896
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	that random YouTubers have been pumping	462.27	2.28
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	over the past few years	464.55	1.65
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	or actively manage funds to
try to achieve higher returns.	466.2	4.32
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	99% of people, including
myself, cannot handle investing	470.52	4.08
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	in something with a
high risk and potential,	474.6	2.7
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	potential, high return.	477.3	2.04
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	So don't even bother.	479.34	0.87
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	The money in this account
is for retirement,	480.21	2.4
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	so is it really worth it to risk	482.61	1.92
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	that 60-year-old's financial wellbeing	484.53	2.369
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	because you decided to gamble	486.899	2.371
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	with their money right now?	489.27	2.1
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I doubt it.	491.37	0.833
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Some of you might be over
the income limit to be able	492.203	1.551
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to contribute to a Roth IRA,	493.754	2.326
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	or some of you will be at
that point in the future	496.08	3.3
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	as your income grows.	499.38	1.44
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	You can still contribute to a Roth IRA	500.82	2.28
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to take advantage of the tax-free growth	503.1	2.43
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	by doing a backdoor Roth.	505.53	1.86
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	To simply explain the process,
all you do is contribute	507.39	2.97
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to a traditional IRA.	510.36	1.71
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Do not invest the money yet.	512.07	2.19
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Then contact your brokerage
to have them convert	514.26	3.06
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	the money to a Roth IRA.	517.32	1.785
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Now, I have done it with M1 Finance before	519.105	2.445
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and it was extremely easy.	521.55	2.1
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	It only took I think two or three days	523.65	2.55
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	for the money to get into my Roth IRA.	526.2	2.13
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Only do this if it makes sense	528.33	1.71
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	based on your current tax rates
and future financial plans.	530.04	3.36
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	There's two things that you can do.	533.4	1.35
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	if you are someone who thinks	534.75	1.14
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	that you might be over the income limit,	535.89	2.22
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	but you are not going to 100%
know until the year is over.	538.11	3.07
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Number one, you can
either wait until January	541.18	2.81
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	of the following year,
like we talked about in one	543.99	2.52
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	of the previous mistakes that
I mentioned, or number two,	546.51	2.58
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	you can just contribute the
money to a traditional IRA,	549.09	3.023
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	then do a backdoor Roth within
the year to get the money	552.113	3.622
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	into the account so it can be invested.	555.735	2.445
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	That way, if you are
over the income limit,	558.18	1.89
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	you've already done the backdoor Roth.	560.07	1.53
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	If you're under the income limit,	561.6	1.77
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	no big deal 'cause you had to pay taxes	563.37	2.01
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	on that money that was going
into the Roth IRA anyways.	565.38	2.454
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	A question I get a lot is
whether or not you can contribute	567.834	2.789
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to a Roth IRA on different brokerages.	570.623	3.247
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	The simple answer is yes.	573.87	1.47
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	This is how it would play out.	575.34	1.32
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	You can contribute up	576.66	1.05
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to the max for one year
on, say, M1 Finance.	577.71	2.447
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Then you can decide to contribute up	580.157	2.593
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to the max on fidelity the next year.	582.75	2.43
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Then you can contribute up	585.18	1.41
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to the max on Vanguard the following year.	586.59	2.28
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	So by the end of that third year,	588.87	1.41
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	you would have three different Roth IRAs	590.28	2.1
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	with three different brokerages,	592.38	2.07
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and there is no problem with that.	594.45	1.44
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	You can take it one step further.	595.89	1.44
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	If you decide, hey, out of these three,	597.33	1.74
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I actually like M1 finance
better than the other two,	599.07	3.0
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	you can convert the
Roth IRAs with Fidelity	602.07	2.222
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and Vanguard into your
M1 Finance Roth IRA.	604.292	3.538
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	You can also split up your contribution	607.83	2.13
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	for the same year among
different brokerages.	609.96	2.97
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	So if for this year you want
to say contribute $4,000	612.93	4.338
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to an M1 Finance Roth IRA	617.268	1.482
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	and the remaining $2,500
into a Fidelity Roth IRA,	618.75	4.35
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	then you can do that without any problems.	623.1	2.28
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	The only thing you
cannot do is try to game	625.38	2.73
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	the system by saying contributing $6500	628.11	3.48
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	into an M1 Finance Roth IRA and $6500	631.59	4.4
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	into a Roth IRA with another brokerage.	635.99	3.919
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	You cannot exceed the maximum
amount allowed per year	639.909	2.751
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	across all of your Roth IRAs	642.66	2.048
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	on all of your brokerage accounts.	644.708	2.272
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Technically, you could do that since all	646.98	2.22
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	of the brokerages aren't talking
to each other to keep track	649.2	3.3
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	of what you are contributing,	652.5	1.65
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	so you have to self-manage this.	654.15	1.89
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I would highly,	656.04	1.08
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	highly recommend making sure
that you do not do this,	657.12	3.99
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	whether it's on purpose or on accident.	661.11	2.52
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I don't know what the penalty is for this,	663.63	1.89
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	but all I know is that you do
not want to get caught trying	665.52	3.6
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	to defraud the government
in any way, shape, or form.	669.12	3.48
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	Long-term investing is the name
of the game with a Roth IRA.	672.6	3.3
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	This money is for when
you are in retirement,	675.9	2.4
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	so make sure to take that into account	678.3	2.37
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	when investing this money.	680.67	1.65
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	No gambling it on stocks
that random YouTubers	682.32	3.06
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	are promoting.	685.38	0.833
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	I think the two or three fund portfolio	686.213	1.777
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	is perfect for your Roth IRA,	687.99	1.997
SXnS7IPy864	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnS7IPy864	which you can learn more about
in these videos to your left.	689.987	3.283

hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	of top 50 stocks in India so we are	123.479	3.42
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	talking about the biggest Indian	125.64	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	companies this has grown by four percent	126.899	4.261
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	so you'll say that okay fine here four	129.3	4.56
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	percent it has gone up TK very good it's	131.16	4.38
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	not a problem but see you have to	133.86	4.14
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	understand this issue from a real return	135.54	4.38
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	perspective now what is the meaning of	138.0	3.959
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	real return well to understand the story	139.92	4.62
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	you need to understand the fact that INR	141.959	4.92
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	every year it falls in relation to the	144.54	4.32
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	US dollar and how much does it fall by	146.879	4.141
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	so in a typical year it falls by roughly	148.86	3.959
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	four four and a half percent but last	151.02	4.2
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	year the INR has gotten weaken compared	152.819	5.221
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	to the US dollar by roughly 11 percent	155.22	5.94
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	so if you consider this and this then	158.04	4.919
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	what is the real negative return that	161.16	3.299
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	you are making you are making real	162.959	3.661
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	negative return in the last one year in	164.459	4.621
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the nifty 50 which is equal to minus	166.62	4.619
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	seven percent so this does not look	169.08	4.08
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	promising now you might have a counter	171.239	3.421
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	question that is the government not	173.16	4.68
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	doing anything in order to save the INR	174.66	4.859
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and is it actually a bad mismanagement	177.84	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	from the government see I will give you	179.519	3.601
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	a very rational commentary I am not	181.5	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	trying to sensationalize anything I	183.12	3.42
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	would actually stand by the government	185.22	3.659
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	decisions here so government right now	186.54	4.08
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	has taken two three decisions regarding	188.879	4.021
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the same it has both positive effect and	190.62	4.199
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	negative effect in terms of the overall	192.9	3.9
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Market scenario so let me quickly	194.819	3.661
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	explain this this is slightly higher	196.8	3.54
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	order macroeconomics that I am trying to	198.48	3.6
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	teach you so do press the like button so	200.34	3.36
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that these type of videos reach out to	202.08	3.6
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	more people and let me explain both the	203.7	3.959
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	positives and negative sides as to why	205.68	4.199
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the government needs to balance out this	207.659	4.5
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	situation that hey you know what let not	209.879	4.14
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	be INR fall more so here is a very quick	212.159	3.901
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	snippet so as I said earlier that in a	214.019	4.08
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	typical year the INR Falls by four to	216.06	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	five percent compared to the US dollar	218.099	3.541
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and in the last one year it has fallen	219.72	4.32
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	by roughly 11 percent so as a result the	221.64	4.44
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Forex reserves of India are also going	224.04	4.259
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	down quite aggressively and this is	226.08	4.079
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	turning out to be a big political issue	228.299	3.241
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and you know what people keep on doing	230.159	3.3
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	politics so I'll not comment on that I	231.54	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	will comment on the economic side so in	233.459	3.42
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	order to solve for at least somewhat	235.2	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	mitigate this problem meanwhile the	236.879	3.481
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Indian government is currently taking	238.86	3.299
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	two three broad steps and this has both	240.36	3.299
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	positives and negative sides so let me	242.159	3.541
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	explain both so one is that in terms of	243.659	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the U.S Stock Investing they have	245.7	4.92
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	introduced a TCS tax collected ad source	247.379	6.121
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	of 20 so this simply means that if a	250.62	4.679
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	certain threshold is met when you are	253.5	4.5
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	investing outside of India then you have	255.299	5.461
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	to pay a TCS tax collected at source of	258.0	5.04
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	20 now what this is going to do is that	260.76	4.14
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	this is going to dissuade people from	263.04	4.68
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	taking money out of India now just from	264.9	5.04
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	a Clarity perspective now does it mean	267.72	4.62
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that you are paying 20 additional tax if	269.94	4.319
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	you are taking your money from India to	272.34	4.079
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the US the short answer is no you're not	274.259	3.541
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	doing that it is just that this money	276.419	3.361
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	gets blocked in a way so you're not able	277.8	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	to transfer the capital quickly this is	279.78	3.359
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the tax that you would have paid at the	281.52	3.36
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	back end but now this has become a	283.139	3.06
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	front-end tax so there's a lot of	284.88	2.879
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	misnomer that is going around that you	286.199	3.541
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	know what 20 additional tax okay nothing	287.759	4.201
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	of that sort 20 additional tax is not	289.74	4.019
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	there it is just because of the TCS	291.96	3.42
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	issue that rather than paying the money	293.759	3.0
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	subsequently you are paying the money	295.38	3.24
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	upfront so that is the simple change	296.759	3.301
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that has happened second key thing is	298.62	3.06
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that you might have also noticed that a	300.06	2.82
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	few months back the Indian government	301.68	3.12
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	made the decision that you know what if	302.88	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	you are transferring money outside India	304.8	4.08
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	under liberalized remittance scheme and	306.6	3.84
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	if it is meeting a certain threshold	308.88	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	then you will have to pay additional tax	310.44	4.5
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	beyond that and that was put at five	312.66	4.259
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	percent now why these steps are being	314.94	4.259
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	taken well simply because to address	316.919	4.681
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	this fall because of Tomorrow the INR	319.199	4.5
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	gets weakened quite aggressively then it	321.6	3.96
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	will become an issue on the same lines	323.699	3.301
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the Indian government is trying to	325.56	3.6
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	dissuade you from investing in cryptos	327.0	3.479
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	they have already introduced more	329.16	3.18
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Taxation and a bunch of other changes	330.479	3.961
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	have been brought now am I approving or	332.34	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	disapproving of these issues nothing so	334.44	3.24
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	there are pros and cons to both these	336.12	2.76
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	situation and I'll explain that	337.68	3.0
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	subsequently on the video so right now	338.88	3.18
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	what is happening in the Indian market	340.68	3.9
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	is that a our stock market circumstances	342.06	4.44
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	are somehow deteriorating and second	344.58	4.02
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	because of this Forex issue the	346.5	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	government is becoming little bit more	348.6	3.06
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	proactive this has negative	350.22	2.94
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	repercussions which I'll speak about	351.66	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	subsequently but moving on to point two	353.16	4.08
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the overarching theme that is being	355.44	3.599
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	created in the stock market right now is	357.24	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that there is an a lot of fear-mongering	359.039	2.88
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that is happening that you know what	360.96	2.579
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Nifty is going to fall to like 10 000	361.919	4.081
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	levels or whatever so a lot of retail	363.539	4.621
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	participation has stopped so this is the	366.0	4.259
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	data from BSE and NSE and you can see	368.16	4.62
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that what the dip in interest has been	370.259	4.201
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	from retail participants and you can	372.78	3.62
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	figure that out by looking at	374.46	4.44
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	non-institute to total so non-institute	376.4	5.2
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	means retail to total so back in	378.9	5.579
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	February of 2022 the retail	381.6	5.46
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	participation was roughly 55 it has	384.479	5.761
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	fallen to 44 and if I take you a year	387.06	5.88
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	back roughly in 2021 this retail	390.24	5.64
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	participation was roughly 66 so it has	392.94	4.92
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	been falling quite aggressively so	395.88	3.96
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	retail participants have bounced off	397.86	4.26
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	this is both good news and bad news now	399.84	4.26
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	why is it a good news so in Hindi there	402.12	3.919
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	is a kahawat called as	404.1	4.26
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	what it simply means is that during the	406.039	4.181
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	rainy season a lot of frogs you start	408.36	3.54
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	seeing but when the rainy season goes	410.22	3.479
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	away then those frogs also go away so	411.9	3.12
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	something similar is happening with	413.699	3.06
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	retail investors that went it was like	415.02	3.42
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	fair weather that even everything was	416.759	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	dancing jumping around everyone was	418.44	3.9
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	making money a lot of weak retail	420.479	4.021
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	investors also jumped into the mix and	422.34	3.54
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	they were trying to make money now	424.5	2.759
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	unfortunately they are not making money	425.88	3.599
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	they have bounced off and who is	427.259	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	remaining right now so pretty strong	429.479	3.361
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	retail investors so if you are in that	430.979	3.961
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	mix you are still investing that means	432.84	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that you are a strong retail investor	434.94	3.599
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	who somewhat understand the fundamentals	436.5	3.96
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	behind Stock Investing now how does this	438.539	3.541
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	make sense from an economics point of	440.46	3.0
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	view so let me quickly illustrate that	442.08	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	so imagine a case where number of buyers	443.46	4.2
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	in the stock market are greater than	445.86	3.54
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	number of sellers then what is going to	447.66	4.14
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	happen that if more people are buying	449.4	4.38
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and there are fewer sellers then the	451.8	3.959
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	price would become what the price will	453.78	4.44
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	go up now what is happening in the stock	455.759	4.38
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	market as per the previous data that I	458.22	3.539
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	had shown you well the number of buyers	460.139	3.421
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	have decreased so stocks are available	461.759	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	at low price or high price well they	463.56	3.84
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	would be available at a lower price the	465.539	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	price will go down so therefore one	467.4	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	could say that the stock market is	469.259	4.141
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	already in an oversold zone so that is	471.06	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the simple point that I will leave you	473.4	3.18
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	so this was the story regarding the	474.84	3.359
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	retail investor buying but what about	476.58	4.38
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the hni category fi dies what are they	478.199	4.321
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	doing so okay so let me show you some	480.96	3.359
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	very quick and important data so here	482.52	3.899
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	you can check the month-wise data of FIS	484.319	3.901
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and you will see that they have sold in	486.419	4.62
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	tune of 41 000 crores now such large	488.22	6.539
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	volume of selling came in June of 2022	491.039	6.541
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and before that now interesting part is	494.759	5.22
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that this is January 2023 data so the	497.58	3.899
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	February data will be released in couple	499.979	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	of days and my hypothesis would be that	501.479	3.84
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	they would have sold almost an equal	503.639	4.021
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	very high amount so fiis have already	505.319	4.081
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	cut a lot of their position retail	507.66	3.18
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	investors have already cut a lot of	509.4	3.36
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	their positions so what is happening the	510.84	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	buyer interest in the market is right	512.76	3.659
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	now low compared to the sellers so	514.5	3.3
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	therefore you are getting things at a	516.419	3.12
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	discount so then comes the next logical	517.8	3.299
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	question as to why this is happening	519.539	3.12
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that fiis are not trusting the Indian	521.099	3.421
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	market retail investors have bounced	522.659	3.3
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	back okay so it's a combination of	524.52	3.06
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	different things and I will highlight	525.959	3.961
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	four very important points so first and	527.58	4.08
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	foremost is a local issue called as the	529.92	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	adani issue I have already made a lot of	531.66	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	videos I will again link them in the	533.58	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	comment and description box please go	535.38	3.54
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and watch it I have presented an	537.36	3.659
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	unbiased analysis you yourself will be	538.92	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	able to look at the data and form your	541.019	4.26
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	own opinions now adani issue has both an	542.64	4.5
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	internal part and an external part so	545.279	4.141
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	let me quickly explain that so internal	547.14	4.08
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	simply means that fundamentally people	549.42	4.62
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	are debating whether the adani group is	551.22	4.559
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	strong enough not strong enough they	554.04	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	have sold it quite aggressively a lot of	555.779	4.081
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	fiis have also cut their position now	557.76	4.079
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	pressure is being built on LIC to cut	559.86	4.38
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	its position so the Irani stocks have	561.839	4.261
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	actually Fallen by a lot over the last	564.24	3.659
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	one month you can go and check the data	566.1	4.02
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	now we can also attend debate key adani	567.899	4.981
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	stocks should I trade should I not trade	570.12	4.68
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that is a separate discussion altogether	572.88	4.019
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	but to cut the long story short there is	574.8	4.32
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	a lot of internal uncertainty within the	576.899	4.261
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	adani group that is hitting its	579.12	4.2
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	fundamentals so as a result the adani	581.16	3.96
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	group of Industries itself has fallen	583.32	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	now what is happening due to that entire	585.12	3.659
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	tamasha is that now people are saying	587.1	3.9
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that you know what adani is a part of	588.779	4.141
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Indian stock market and there is a lot	591.0	4.44
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	of external damage that it can cause so	592.92	4.44
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	this is true at two levels so the first	595.44	3.959
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	level is that okay banks will get	597.36	4.32
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	directly hit so as a result over the	599.399	4.141
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	last one month even the banking stocks	601.68	3.96
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	have aggressively Fallen but banks have	603.54	3.6
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	come out with their own statements that	605.64	3.12
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	you know what we do not have massive	607.14	3.84
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	exposure to adani groups couple of banks	608.76	4.019
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	have been raised eyebrows on for example	610.98	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Bank of Baroda very irresponsible	612.779	3.541
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	statement given according to me from	614.64	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	their MD CEO again please go and watch	616.32	3.48
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	my video to understand the entire	618.3	4.5
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	context but SBI LIC Bank of Baroda some	619.8	5.039
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	TSU banks are actually supporting the	622.8	4.14
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	adani group as of now and as a result	624.839	4.141
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the banking stocks are taking a beating	626.94	3.6
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	now the second bigger part of the	628.98	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	equation is the overall impact on the	630.54	5.16
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Indian stock market in general so so far	632.7	4.56
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	what was happening was that you know	635.7	3.6
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	what the adani issue blew up then as a	637.26	3.96
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	result Banks also failed and people were	639.3	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	looking at a system that okay you know	641.22	3.72

hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	come someone is going to come forward	644.94	3.959
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	provide a little bit of transparency or	646.62	4.26
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	this issue is going to get sorted out	648.899	4.201
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	maybe there will be positive news maybe	650.88	4.38
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	there will be negative news and maybe we	653.1	4.56
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	will get certain kind of certainty but	655.26	4.5
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	this certainty is not happening no one	657.66	3.9
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	is going to predict that what exactly is	659.76	3.42
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	going to happen in the adani issue what	661.56	3.06

hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the exact exposure that the banks have	666.72	4.26
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	so due to this uncertainty issue it has	668.519	4.681
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	started transpiring first from adani	670.98	4.5
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	stocks then to bank and then to the	673.2	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	broader stock market that we are	675.48	2.88
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	currently seeing now then comes the	676.98	2.82
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	second issue as to why the Indian	678.36	3.3
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	markets are falling and this is	679.8	3.24
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	something that was very predictable and	681.66	2.82
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	I've been making videos regarding the	683.04	3.299
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	same right from December January onwards	684.48	4.14
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and my tune on this has stayed exactly	686.339	4.081
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the same so this has to do with the	688.62	3.719
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	international interest rate so to say so	690.42	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	interest rates everywhere are very high	692.339	4.56
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and the U.S right now is sitting on this	694.14	4.319
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	very high interest rate and they are	696.899	2.821
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	saying that you know what we are roughly	698.459	3.601
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	going to pay six percent interest rates	699.72	4.739
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	in U.S just for context the normal FD	702.06	3.719
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	rates in the US are maybe like one	704.459	2.761
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	percent right now they are paying six	705.779	3.0
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	percent where will U.S citizens put	707.22	3.239
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	their money they will put their money in	708.779	4.381
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	FD so to say similarly fias foreign	710.459	4.62
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Institutional Investor they are thinking	713.16	3.299
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that you know what why should we take	715.079	3.301
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	risk with markets or Emerging Markets	716.459	4.32
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	like India or other parts of the global	718.38	4.32
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	economy when we can make safe money by	720.779	4.141
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	putting our money in American fds so	722.7	3.6
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	therefore what they are simply doing is	724.92	3.12
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that they are choosing to invest in the	726.3	4.8
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	bond market over the equity market so	728.04	4.38
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	this is a simple choice that they have	731.1	3.0
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	made this has got nothing specifically	732.42	3.3
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	to do with the Indian stock market	734.1	3.479
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	percent so this is a World level problem	735.72	3.84
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and we can't isolate the problem to	737.579	3.601
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	India here the interest rates are high	739.56	3.48
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	everywhere now when will the stock	741.18	3.779
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	market situation overall in the world	743.04	3.96
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	improve well it's very simple when the	744.959	4.141
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	interest rate starts to get cut now	747.0	3.36
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	comes the natural question that when	749.1	3.06
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	will interest rate start to get cut so	750.36	3.419
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	my hypothesis is that it should start	752.16	3.359
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	happening in another five to six months	753.779	3.721
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that is my estimate then come the third	755.519	3.481
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	reason which are miscellaneous reason	757.5	3.839
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	which has to do with high inflation in	759.0	4.76
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the world Russia Ukraine problem	761.339	4.56
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	these have been playing out for the last	763.76	4.0
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	one one and a half years right now a lot	765.899	4.261
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	of certainty has been built on all these	767.76	3.96
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	issues I am not saying that these issues	770.16	3.06
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	cannot blow up of course they can blow	771.72	3.179
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	up but to cut the long story short	773.22	3.119
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	markets are not falling because of these	774.899	3.24
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	issues and then comes the final point	776.339	3.481
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and I have to say it in sake of	778.139	3.121
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	transparency that this is a political	779.82	3.18
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	government oriented point I can't do	781.26	3.24
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	away with this so I'll be straight to	783.0	3.18
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the point blunt with you so yes there	784.5	3.12
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	was a lot of clarity That was supposed	786.18	2.94
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	to be given by the government on the	787.62	3.839
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Irani issue on the crypto issue on the	789.12	4.74
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	U.S taxation issue that has not been	791.459	4.261
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	given and this is disobeying foreign	793.86	4.5
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Institutional Investor now okay before I	795.72	4.2
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	jump slightly deeper into this	798.36	3.539
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	particular Point let me talk about the	799.92	3.539
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	first three points see when it comes to	801.899	2.761
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the interest rate problem or	803.459	2.88
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	miscellaneous problems those things will	804.66	3.479
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	settle there is no problem there but	806.339	4.081
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	when it comes to india-oriented policy	808.139	4.981
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	issues or non-clarity on adani issue	810.42	4.5
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that becomes a little bit of a talkative	813.12	3.54
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	point because think about it from when	814.92	3.479
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	foreign Investor's Viewpoint now who are	816.66	3.179
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	foreign investors so these would be	818.399	3.24
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	people like Ray dalio or organizations	819.839	3.901
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	like JP Morgan Chase now what are they	821.639	3.661
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	thinking they would see India as a	823.74	3.0
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	shining bright light that okay it is a	825.3	2.82
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	very good economy lot of growth	826.74	3.899
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	prospects demography dividend etc etc	828.12	4.38
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	all very good but the problem is that	830.639	2.82
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	you know what when corporate	832.5	3.12
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	transparency is not high that is when	833.459	4.921
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	foreign institutional investors are a	835.62	4.62
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	little bit Coy or shy in terms of	838.38	3.36
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	investing in that particular Market	840.24	3.539
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	because their number one thought process	841.74	3.36
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	would be that you know what that today	843.779	3.841
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	if we back a private company X we give	845.1	4.679
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	our money to that particular Company by	847.62	3.959
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	looking at the fundamentals but if	849.779	3.36
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	tomorrow the government picks a side	851.579	3.421
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	with another private company that we are	853.139	3.241
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	going to support this particular group	855.0	3.899
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	then despite all the fundamental	856.38	4.74
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	analysis these FIS are going to take a	858.899	4.38
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	lot of hit in the market so that becomes	861.12	3.839
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	a little bit of a Troublesome situation	863.279	3.781
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	so I'm a very optimistic person I am	864.959	3.601
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	hopeful that the government will issue	867.06	3.719
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	due clarifications on the entire adani	868.56	4.38
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	issue how much exposure SBI has how much	870.779	4.921
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	exposure LIC has all that stuff is going	872.94	4.68
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	to get clarified with time and as the	875.7	4.079
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	market gains more clarity these internal	877.62	4.079
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	dark clouds on the Indian stock markets	879.779	3.42
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	are going to dissipate so this is the	881.699	2.88
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	simple message that I'll leave you with	883.199	3.361
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	now let me very quickly briefly touch	884.579	4.141
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	upon the fact as to what am I doing in	886.56	4.079
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the market and why so Point number one	888.72	3.9
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	is that this is your support one this is	890.639	3.601
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	your support two this is your support	892.62	3.959
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	three right so support one has already	894.24	3.719
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	been broken and it was quite	896.579	3.541
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	aggressively broken so from a short-term	897.959	4.021
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	perspective I feel that as the Indian	900.12	4.079
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	markets gain more clarity what is going	901.98	3.599
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	to happen is that we are going to see	904.199	3.121
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	this roughly five percent bounce back so	905.579	3.481
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	this is point one that I am quite	907.32	3.54
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	confident about second key thing is that	909.06	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	if the government chooses not to respond	910.86	3.659
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	to the Irani issue with the adani group	912.72	4.44
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	fall more it has fall out then this	914.519	5.88
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	situation of 16800 becomes very very	917.16	4.979
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	strong likelihood that's what I would	920.399	4.201
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	say so if the market Falls to this level	922.139	4.921
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	I am going to invest more so I build	924.6	4.859
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	some position on nifty 50 at this level	927.06	4.56
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	and now I'm going to build even more	929.459	4.261
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	positions at this stage I am unlikely to	931.62	3.839
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	buy anything here now comes the next	933.72	3.479
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	question when will exactly the stock	935.459	3.661
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	market bounce well I do not know when	937.199	4.021
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	exactly the stock market will bounce but	939.12	3.779
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	right now a lot of stocks are available	941.22	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	at a massive discount so I will build	942.899	4.321
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	even more positions in individual stocks	945.0	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	here so this is the second key thing	947.22	3.0
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that I am going to do and I am going to	948.66	3.179
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	take you along with my journey I keep on	950.22	3.179
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	explaining what is it that I'm buying	951.839	2.94
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	selling on the YouTube member Community	953.399	3.481
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	you can consider joining it Point number	954.779	4.68
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	two is that I am not buying any High get	956.88	4.74
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	firm right now it is highly dangerous	959.459	4.021
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	there is no point in going after high	961.62	3.54
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	debt businesses it is a very very	963.48	3.539
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	dangerous game not only because of the	965.16	3.84
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Viewpoint that those companies might	967.019	4.021
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	struggle to repay their debt but also	969.0	3.42
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	because of the point that it might	971.04	3.18
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	become harder and harder for them to	972.42	3.659
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	procure money or get money from the	974.22	3.66
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	market because right now it seems to me	976.079	3.961
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that if the adani issue blows up then a	977.88	3.84
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	lot of restrictions might be put on Bank	980.04	3.78
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	in terms of lending that is usually how	981.72	3.6
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	it functions that a lot of committees	983.82	3.3
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	are built and that hits the credit so	985.32	3.36
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	this is the second key thing and third	987.12	3.54
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	key thing is that almost every industry	988.68	3.899
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	or many of the industries are at a great	990.66	3.72
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	buying level for example consider right	992.579	4.26
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	now Automotive if you consider maruti it	994.38	4.079
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	has hardly even any run up over the last	996.839	3.601
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	three four years secondly consider even	998.459	3.901
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	HDFC Bank hardly any run-up that has	1000.44	3.36
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	happened if you consider its last two	1002.36	3.06
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	three year window then comes consumer	1003.8	3.479
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	durables they have been badly beaten if	1005.42	3.539
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	you consider small cap mid cap again	1007.279	3.48
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	badly written so you can literally close	1008.959	3.361
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	your eye pick good good companies which	1010.759	3.241
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	are fundamentally strong wait for the	1012.32	3.06
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	interest rate to fall and you are going	1014.0	2.94
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	to make crazy amount of money so this is	1015.38	3.18
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	the simple message that I leave you with	1016.94	3.3
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	many people well confused my commentary	1018.56	2.88
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that actually some days your bullish	1020.24	2.519
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	some days you are bearish no it depends	1021.44	3.18
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	on the Viewpoint or the specific trade	1022.759	3.781
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	that you have taken for example in a two	1024.62	4.02
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	to three year window I am 100 bullish I	1026.54	3.419
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	have never been more bullish about the	1028.64	3.12
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	Indian market than I am right now simply	1029.959	3.48
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	because a massive time correction has	1031.76	3.299
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	already happened but if you consider	1033.439	4.14
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	absolute short term or midi term now I	1035.059	3.721
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	don't know how the anani issue is going	1037.579	3.681
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	to blow up whether	1038.78	4.98
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	so I can't comment whether the market is	1041.26	4.96
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	going to fall to 16 800 or not that no	1043.76	4.079
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	one is able to predict if people are	1046.22	2.88
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	trying to predict that they are simply	1047.839	2.881
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	trying to do guesswork so that is the	1049.1	3.0
hIR-5gWDVnU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR-5gWDVnU	message that I'll leave you with I hope	1050.72	2.76

j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	this is a part that no one is explaining	35.64	4.079
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	so I will talk about that and finally	37.68	4.08
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	what is it that you and I as normal	39.719	4.5

j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	at this particular snippet this outlines	49.32	4.079
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	some of the key amendments that have	51.539	3.601
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	been made to the finance bill so the	53.399	3.241
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	first key amendment is regarding the	55.14	3.18
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	mutual funds and you can see that the	56.64	4.02
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	mutual funds having less than 35 percent	58.32	5.52
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	AUM in domestic Equity to lose	60.66	5.16

j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	point number six right and this is a	67.979	3.601
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	very interesting point that Securities	70.08	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	transaction tax on the sale of options	71.58	5.16

j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	turnover this this so all this has been	76.74	4.08
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	written so Point number six if you don't	78.78	4.019
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	understand Futures and options much in	80.82	4.2
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	simple words it is saying that SKT has	82.799	4.68
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	gone up in terms of option selling now	85.02	4.8
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	this creates further pressure on fno	87.479	3.841
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	Traders and specially the trading	89.82	3.839
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	Community already trading is a	91.32	4.619
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	profession where people do not make very	93.659	3.841
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	healthy returns these are not my words	95.939	3.421
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	these are the words of nitin kamath and	97.5	3.36
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	nikhil kamath who are the co-founders of	99.36	4.38
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	zeroda and they have said that 99 of	100.86	5.219
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	Traders do not even beat fixed deposit	103.74	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	returned and on top of that if more	106.079	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	taxation is introduced for Traders this	108.06	3.96
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	becomes a very complicated point now you	110.399	3.961
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	will say okay I'm not a Trader so okay	112.02	4.08
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	let's move to point number one and let	114.36	3.66
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	me break it down what exactly does it	116.1	3.6
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	mean so okay so let me break down this	118.02	3.3
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	specific point and very easy to	119.7	3.54
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	understand language so let's assume that	121.32	4.439
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	you invest 1 lakh rupee in mutual funds	123.24	4.68
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	what type of mutual fund debt mutual	125.759	3.48
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	fund so what is the meaning of debt	127.92	2.88
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	mutual fund so basically there can be	129.239	3.841
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	two categorizations that can be done one	130.8	4.019
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	is called as Equity mutual fund and one	133.08	3.659
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	is called as debt mutual fund so for	134.819	3.541
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	example when you are going and paying	136.739	3.781
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	let's say 10 000 Rupees to your mutual	138.36	4.019
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	fund manager and if they are picking up	140.52	3.359
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	that money that they are going and	142.379	4.021
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	buying ITC HDFC Bank stock PD light	143.879	5.281
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	stock so that is called as Equity mutual	146.4	4.38
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	fund what is the meaning of debt mutual	149.16	3.36
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	fund so debt mutual fund simply means	150.78	3.9
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	that these are bonds so what is a bond	152.52	3.66
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	so I'd already made a video couple of	154.68	2.82
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	days back I will link it in the	156.18	2.94
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	description box you can go and watch it	157.5	3.48
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	in case you are not aware of what bond	159.12	4.5
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	is but one of the Prime examples of bond	160.98	3.839
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	would be something like government	163.62	4.259
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	securities or even fixed deposits so	164.819	5.28

j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	three years this 10 000 rupee is going	182.459	4.261
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	to grow at a kagger of seven and a half	184.92	3.599
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	percent and you will get that money back	186.72	3.599
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	after three years so in very simple	188.519	3.901
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	words a bond is a promise that could be	190.319	3.84
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	made by a bank that could be made by	192.42	3.599
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	government organizations or there could	194.159	4.021
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	be corporate bonds also so please watch	196.019	3.481
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	my video in case you don't understand	198.18	3.36
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	what bonds are I have explained it in	199.5	4.08
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	more detail so back to the change or the	201.54	3.66
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	amendment that has happened so let's	203.58	3.299
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	assume that you are investing 1 lakh	205.2	3.899
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	rupee in mutual funds what type debt	206.879	4.44
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	mutual funds so up until now the rule	209.099	3.961
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	simply said that if you are investing	211.319	4.381
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	your money in debt mutual funds and if	213.06	4.74
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	you hold that mutual fund for three	215.7	4.74
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	years or more then you get indexation	217.8	5.159
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	benefits and what is indexation benefits	220.44	4.68
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	I'll explain that and after applying the	222.959	4.081
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	indexation benefits you will have to pay	225.12	4.979
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	20 taxes so I know that many of you	227.04	4.5
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	might not have gotten this point so let	230.099	3.181
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	me break it down with an example so	231.54	3.3
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	let's say that you invest 1 lakh rupees	233.28	4.44
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	right and your growth on mutual fund is	234.84	5.039
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	let's say a kagger of 10 so for that	237.72	4.68
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	ease of Simplicity let's assume that one	239.879	4.92
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	lakh rupee after three years it becomes	242.4	5.16
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	how much so it becomes 1.3 lakhs so what	244.799	4.741
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	is the total benefit or total profit you	247.56	4.14
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	have made you have made 30 000 rupees as	249.54	4.14
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	your total profit and what is the growth	251.7	3.78
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	rate that we are assuming here so we are	253.68	3.54
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	assuming 10 percent as the growth rate	255.48	4.319
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	now indexation simply means that what is	257.22	4.5
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	the rate of inflation or what is the	259.799	3.781
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	average rate of inflation over the last	261.72	3.66
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	three years so in India it will come out	263.58	3.179
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	to be roughly let's say six to seven	265.38	3.42
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	percent and what is the rate at which	266.759	4.081
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	your money has grown it has gone at 10	268.8	4.08
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	percent so if you assume seven percent	270.84	4.919
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	and offset 8 then so ten percent minus	272.88	4.56
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	seven percent that becomes three percent	275.759	3.841
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	so this is the growth rate that we would	277.44	4.02
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	assume so in year one and again we are	279.6	3.48
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	just simplifying here so in year one it	281.46	4.98
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	will become 1.03 then 1.06 and 1.09 yes	283.08	5.16
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	I am not included compounding just to	286.44	3.9
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	explain you the math so yeah your total	288.24	3.84
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	profit becomes how much nine thousand	290.34	4.2
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	now on this you had to pay like 20 tax	292.08	4.26
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	so now what has happened is that the	294.54	3.719
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	indexation benefit has been taken away	296.34	4.2
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	so now to cut the long story short that	298.259	4.681
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	taxation on debt mutual fund has gone up	300.54	4.68
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	quite a lot so now the government was	302.94	4.22
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	asked that okay	305.22	4.259
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	and you're taxing them more so why	307.16	4.36
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	explain the rationale so basically this	309.479	3.301
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	is one of the narrative that they have	311.52	3.42
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	presented again let me explain that so	312.78	3.96
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	their point is let's see you guys do	314.94	3.539
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	fixed deposits also right that for	316.74	3.239
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	example you are depositing one lakh	318.479	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	rupees then in three years if we assume	319.979	5.641
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	10 growth rate so total 30 months simple	322.199	5.28
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	interest so simple growth rate then in	325.62	4.019
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	three years it becomes 1.3 lakh so your	327.479	4.321
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	profit is 30k right so same as before	329.639	5.221
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	now fds are taxed as per the income slab	331.8	5.04
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	that you are in that this 30k will be	334.86	4.2
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	considered as a gain or a capital gains	336.84	5.46
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	and if you are in the 30 tax bucket then	339.06	6.0
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	you will have to pay 9000 as taxes so	342.3	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	this kind of levels the playing field	345.06	4.02
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	between fixed deposits and debt mutual	346.62	4.26
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	funds so this is the statement that is	349.08	3.24
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	coming out from the government now you	350.88	3.0
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	tell me whether this is sensible this is	352.32	3.24
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	not sensible I will just quickly present	353.88	3.48
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	my analysis and I'm not trying to	355.56	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	criticize the finance ministry finance	357.36	4.26
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	minister government etc etc I'm just	359.28	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	simply trying to present the Viewpoint	361.62	3.06
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	here so let me very quickly help you	363.0	3.24
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	understand the difference between fixed	364.68	3.78
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	deposit Investments and debt mutual fund	366.24	4.26
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	Investments see when you are investing	368.46	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	in fixed deposit you are inherently	370.5	3.84
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	taking slightly lesser risk because in	372.18	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	debt mutual funds depending on the type	374.34	4.38
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	of debt that you are buying or getting	376.5	4.5
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	your money invested into it could be	378.72	4.319
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	corporate debt so the risk is higher so	381.0	3.9
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	therefore the reward also should be	383.039	4.141
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	higher for people to continue to invest	384.9	3.9
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	in debt mutual funds so this is like	387.18	3.66
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	simple principle of investing that for	388.8	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	every unit of risk that you are taking	390.84	3.96
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	you should be compensated adequately	392.52	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	enough so this is point one that you	394.8	3.959
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	should understand second key point is	396.84	3.299
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	let's see when you are investing your	398.759	3.66
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	money in debt mutual funds there could	400.139	5.221
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	be loss of principle so the entire	402.419	5.761
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	crisis of Silicon Valley Bank happened	405.36	5.339
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	because there was loss of principle on	408.18	4.139
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	their government Bond so to say which	410.699	4.021
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	was a 30-year held detail maturity Bond	412.319	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	what happens in debt mutual fund is that	414.72	3.419
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	sometimes there are like 10 10 year	416.639	4.021
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	bonds or 30 30 year bonds you buy them	418.139	4.741
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	let's say in the year 2023 they are	420.66	5.34
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	maturing in the year 2033 then in 2025	422.88	4.98
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	your wedding is coming up you'll say our	426.0	4.46
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	passage	427.86	2.6
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	so you need a lot of money so in 2025	432.919	4.9
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	you decide I had purchased like some	435.84	4.02
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	debt mutual fund I will liquidate them	437.819	3.361
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	so what is the meaning of liquidation	439.86	3.0
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	liquidation means that you want to sell	441.18	3.6
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	them off so the point is that in the	442.86	3.899
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	secondary Market secondary Market means	444.78	3.3
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	that if you have purchased a security	446.759	3.901
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	the way Silicon Valley Bank did which	448.08	4.5
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	was a 30-year hilltill maturity security	450.66	4.86
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	and let's say that at the point of	452.58	5.16
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	getting maturity after 30 years it was	455.52	5.1
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	at 100 rupees right but since Silicon	457.74	5.34
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	Valley Bank had to sell them off in the	460.62	4.4
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	market earlier because they needed money	463.08	5.22
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	they only sold it at 70 rupees so there	465.02	5.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	was loss of principle that happened so	468.3	3.42
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	something similar can also happen with	470.34	3.6
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	debt mutual fund and finally because the	471.72	3.96
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	government's perspective was okay we	473.94	3.78
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	want to level the playing field for FD	475.68	3.959
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	and debt mutual funds so therefore	477.72	3.96
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	withdrawal of incentive for debt mutual	479.639	4.441
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	fund by upper level playing field that	481.68	4.44
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	you give tax benefits here also no leave	484.08	4.019
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	some room for retail investors and small	486.12	3.419
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	players let them also make a little bit	488.099	3.061
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	of money so to cut the long story short	489.539	3.181
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	to me it does not make a lot of sense	491.16	3.96
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	why fds should be treated exactly like	492.72	4.5
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	debt mutual fund because inherent risk	495.12	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	in debt mutual fund is higher now you	497.22	3.599
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	only tell me that now would you want to	498.84	3.78
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	park your money in debt funds or would	500.819	3.481
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	you rather want to park your money in	502.62	3.6
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	fixed deposits I will simply go and put	504.3	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	my money in fixed deposits I would put	506.22	4.02
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	zero money in debt mutual funds and	508.02	3.78
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	finally one more point you need to keep	510.24	3.299
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	in mind that when you are doing fixed	511.8	4.2
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	deposit the bank does it charge you like	513.539	4.38
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	some commission expense ratio all this	516.0	3.02
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	stuff	517.919	2.881
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	that's a separate conversation	519.02	4.12
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	altogether but the debt mutual fund	520.8	3.659
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	manager go and take a look at the	523.14	3.18
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	expense ratio that they charge so all	524.459	4.081
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	these commissions charges not taxation	526.32	4.74
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	benefits also going away I highly	528.54	4.08
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	doubted that a lot of people will get	531.06	3.779
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	excited about debt mutual fund investing	532.62	4.44
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	space so now comes part two and I will	534.839	4.021
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	explain you from a macroeconomics point	537.06	4.08
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	of view why this is is really being done	538.86	4.02

j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	researching and to be honest I'm a	550.62	3.24
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	single person team none of my work is	552.12	3.719
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	outsourced in terms of having big teams	553.86	3.84
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	making them research I sit and study	555.839	3.601
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	every single point so I study more than	557.7	4.02
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	IIT experience every day so for me marks	559.44	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	I like likes and comments that you guys	561.72	3.78
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	give so yeah so a like will be deeply	563.16	4.2
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	appreciated so anyways coming back to	565.5	3.66
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	the point and there are three Graphics	567.36	3.479
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	that I would like to show so the first	569.16	3.6
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	graphic is the debt graphic right so	570.839	3.741
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	debt simply means	572.76	4.259
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	and how much loan the governments and	574.58	4.54
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	everyone has taken for example this is	577.019	4.141
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	the private debt and this is the public	579.12	4.44
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	debt right so you can see that the rate	581.16	5.04
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	at weights the debt has gone up has been	583.56	4.44
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	quite massive there has been an	586.2	3.96
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	explosion of debt in the world right	588.0	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	from 1970s onwards this was like 100	590.16	5.28
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	units now we are sitting at 256 units so	592.32	4.8
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	yeah this is like crazy amount of debt	595.44	4.079
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	that is there now when someone takes	597.12	4.8
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	instead what needs to happen you have to	599.519	4.621
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	repay the interest right so that is a	601.92	4.859
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	simple point of taking debt now debt is	604.14	4.74
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	of multiple types for example you can	606.779	5.06
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	take a short-term loan credit card	608.88	5.16
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	second could be that you take a very	611.839	4.301
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	long home loan 30 years it could be 20	614.04	3.78
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	years it could be five years it could be	616.14	3.54
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	10 years so the debt has different	617.82	3.9
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	maturity it matures from like literally	619.68	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	one day all the way to even 100 years	621.72	4.14
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	and Beyond so this brings us to the	624.0	4.2
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	concept of repayment of debt now as the	625.86	3.84
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	interest rates in the world increase	628.2	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	which have been increasing again please	629.7	4.199
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	go and check the interest rates in the	631.92	3.96
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	US and I'll put the snippet here you can	633.899	3.841
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	see that there has been a very sharp	635.88	3.66
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	prize in the interest rates in the world	637.74	4.26
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	so if you put one and two together what	639.54	4.2
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	is it that you can draw you can easily	642.0	3.86
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	figure out that you know what	643.74	4.5
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	and the rate of interest have also gone	645.86	4.96
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	up so the repayment from that side is	648.24	4.8
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	going to go up so in simple words the	650.82	4.38
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	Emi in a way that the government has to	653.04	4.14
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	pay back in terms of the borrowings that	655.2	4.62
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	they have taken that goes up and this is	657.18	4.5
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	what is scaring the government so now	659.82	3.54
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	comes the natural question that what is	661.68	3.48
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	going to be the implication of these	663.36	3.84
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	changes and is there like some macro	665.16	3.96
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	Horizon that we can look at so there are	667.2	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	four specific implications that I see	669.12	3.659
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	right off the bat so first and foremost	670.92	4.859
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	the debt Market was maturing in India at	672.779	4.441
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	a very fast rate because there were	675.779	3.661
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	incentives to invest in debt so that	677.22	4.2
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	incentive has been taken away so the	679.44	4.26
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	maturity of the debt Market gets delayed	681.42	3.479
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	now what is the meaning of this because	683.7	2.879
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	I have thrown a lot of Finance here so	684.899	3.721
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	see there is equity market and there is	686.579	4.38
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	debt market now in the US if you go the	688.62	4.14
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	size of the debt Market is very very big	690.959	3.961
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	the size of equity Market is not that	692.76	4.98
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	big in India somewhat similar was going	694.92	4.44
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	to happen because we need a very	697.74	3.779
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	thriving debt Market that is good for	699.36	3.84
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	the Capital Market so something similar	701.519	3.661
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	was happening but with this move the	703.2	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	majority of debt Market is going to	705.18	3.42
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	stagnate a little bit so this is point	706.92	3.84
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	one point two is that there is going to	708.6	4.38
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	be outflow from the debt market and this	710.76	4.139
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	is directly going to help something like	712.98	3.299
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	real estate market which has been	714.899	3.781
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	lagging in India I had been buying a lot	716.279	4.381
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	of real estate I had categorically	718.68	4.14
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	pointed out I give a lot of commentary	720.66	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	on my stock market course Also regarding	722.82	4.38
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	real estate and also on the member	724.98	4.08
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	Community tab of YouTube regarding	727.2	3.9
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	buying real estate I've been investing	729.06	4.38
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	quite aggressively so as long as the	731.1	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	inflation in the world remains fairly	733.44	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	high and second the interest rates in	735.42	4.26
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	the world become very high so you will	737.76	3.84
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	first get very good real estate deals if	739.68	3.24
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	you are able to scout them really well	741.6	3.179
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	and second is that in a high inflation	742.92	4.26
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	environment the cash flow assets for	744.779	4.381
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	example although and if you are able to	747.18	3.659
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	rent it out you'll be able to make a	749.16	3.54
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	cash flow so these cash flow assets	750.839	4.201
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	become really prominent so therefore I	752.7	4.319
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	have been investing quite a aggressively	755.04	3.539
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	for the last several months in real	757.019	3.241
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	estate I have purchased some new real	758.579	3.481
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	estate also and I will take the	760.26	3.9
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	community through it this is one of the	762.06	3.959
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	sectors that I'm extremely bullish on	764.16	3.479
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	for the next five years if the	766.019	3.481
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	incentives for investing in debt mutual	767.639	3.661
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	funds is withdrawn then the money will	769.5	3.959
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	flow to alternate asset class like real	771.3	5.039
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	estate gold so this is definitely going	773.459	4.5
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	to happen and even in equities there	776.339	3.661
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	will be more investment compared to debt	777.959	5.0
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	third key thing is regarding taxation	780.0	5.399
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	taxations are not going to go down	782.959	5.44
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	anytime soon two decades just wait for	785.399	4.5
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	two decades right people will be doing	788.399	3.421
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	try try when it comes to taxation you	789.899	3.481
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	will say that okay people are doing try	791.82	4.019
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	try now also about taxation no no wait	793.38	4.44
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	and watch two decades everywhere where	795.839	3.481
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	the government can make money they will	797.82	2.94
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	make money and again I'm not trying to	799.32	2.759
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	criticize the current government please	800.76	2.819
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	don't make it like political I'm least	802.079	2.94
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	bothered about politics this is	803.579	3.121
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	generally what is happening around the	805.019	3.541
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	world that taxation structures are going	806.7	3.78
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	up in India also very similar is	808.56	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	happening problem in India is that the	810.48	4.2
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	return on taxation is very very low	812.88	4.019
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	because the social advantages are very	814.68	4.14
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	few people are okay paying taxes that's	816.899	3.421
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	not an issue but if you are getting free	818.82	3.42
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	healthcare free education all that stuff	820.32	3.84
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	then it makes sense to pay such high	822.24	4.26
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	taxes but right now that structure is	824.16	4.38
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	somewhat in an imbalance and this debt	826.5	3.779
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	mutual fund taxation game and also	828.54	3.479
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	additional taxation on Futures and	830.279	3.961
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	options it just highlights it negatively	832.019	4.201
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	and it creates a bad sentiment for the	834.24	3.899
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	capital markets fourth and finally see	836.22	4.739
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	when any economy is trying to become the	838.139	4.861
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	leading economy in the world it needs to	840.959	4.56
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	have fairly stable Capital markets India	843.0	4.68
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	is doing fairly well but investors get	845.519	4.62
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	spooked when such changes are introduced	847.68	5.599
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	at a very fast pace	850.139	3.14
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	you know after one year more taxation on	853.459	4.781
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	something else so people cannot plan	856.5	3.66
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	things out so this becomes a problem so	858.24	3.839
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	big investors wait and watch and it just	860.16	4.02
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	generally dissuades them from investing	862.079	4.32
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	so final part what is it that you and I	864.18	3.719
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	should be doing as retail investors	866.399	3.661
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	number one please understand that making	867.899	4.021
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	returns in the future is going to become	870.06	4.38
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	harder harder and harder that's how it	871.92	4.26
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	is with increased taxation more	874.44	4.44
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	inflation interest rate uncertainty	876.18	4.74
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	these are not healthy signs for any	878.88	3.72
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	economy including India and this is a	880.92	3.479
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	worldwide problem not criticizing India	882.6	4.02
j4uRkc612qw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4uRkc612qw	on this but making real returns is going	884.399	4.261

bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	clickbaity thumbnail get one crore in one
year with only 30,000 SIP but the only trick	443.31	6.15
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	point here is that from which year to which
year this is from the 25th year to the 26th	449.46	7.39
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	year what about first 12 years first 12 years
was just an an utter disappointment is what	456.85	8.05
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	I can say now if you have a look at this specific
chart you can see that is what actually happens	464.9	6.51
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	you can see that what you think should happen
is that slanting line correct we call this	471.41	7.909
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	as a plateau of latent potential what people
think the moment I'm going to start	479.319	5.6
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	30,000, 30,000 my returns should go they should
just go up and I should be very rich in no	484.919	7.741
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	time what happens actually can you see that
value of disappointment yes the the part which	492.66	5.5
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	is below the line that is entirely called
as the value of disappointment which are these	498.16	4.15
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	years in our Excel sheet if you were to compare
which are these years the value of December	502.31	4.479
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	the first 12 years correct but then you can
see when the arrow is starting to you know	506.789	6.781
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	take off that could be the next within the
first the next four years and last you can	513.57	5.579
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	see that there is a sharp price in the arrow
that is that last one year 25 to 26 okay so	519.149	7.861
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	that is what typically happens in the compounding
thing first few years you have to keep yourself	527.01	7.05
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	focused disciplined if you do that you will
be able to see the magic happening at you	534.06	5.32

Hera Pheri to earn one crore every year but	546.47	4.929
bAcwAmiUuws	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcwAmiUuws	with the help of proper discipline and compounding

Elon Musk bought Twitter,	0.27	2.4
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	some Tesla investors
worried Musk was abandoning	2.67	2.61
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	the electric vehicle maker	5.28	1.26
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	to focus on the social media company.	6.54	2.085
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	(Musk laughing)	8.625	0.833
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- So in Twitter...	9.458	1.402
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- What could possibly go wrong?	10.86	1.322
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	(all laughing)	12.182	1.918
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- [Narrator] Since the deals
closed in late October,	14.1	1.86
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	Tesla shares have slipped
ending the year down 65%.	15.96	3.42
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	The company's worst year on record.	19.38	2.46
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	But the reason for the selloff
goes far beyond Twitter.	21.84	3.03
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	Here's what drove Tesla
investors away in 2022,	24.87	2.79
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	and what's affecting the
car maker going into 2023.	27.66	3.54
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	Let's start with demand.	31.2	2.1
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	For years, Tesla has
stood out as the leader	33.3	2.43
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	in the electric vehicle space,	35.73	1.59
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	and while its dominance continued	37.32	1.59
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	in the third quarter of 2022,	38.91	1.8
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	its market share slipped to 61%.	40.71	2.82
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- In the last year,	43.53	0.9
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	we've seen an explosion of
competing EV models for Tesla,	44.43	5.0
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	and as that number continues
to grow over the years,	49.98	3.72
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	the concern is whether or not demand	53.7	1.56
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	for Tesla vehicles will
continue to stay as high	55.26	1.95
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	as it has been in the past.	57.21	1.26
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- [Narrator] According to JD Power,	58.47	1.26
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	there were 33 EV models
available in the US	59.73	2.85
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	at the end of 2021, but by the end of 2022	62.58	3.75
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	that number had jumped to 53 models.	66.33	2.94
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	Tesla still held four	69.27	1.74
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	of the top five selling
EVs last year according	71.01	2.189
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	to S&P Global Mobility.	73.199	1.921
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	But the sell-off in Tesla shares	75.12	1.98
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	reflects investors' fear
that its hold won't last	77.1	2.918
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	as newer models arrive.	80.018	2.332
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- Tesla has sold the same
sort of handful of models	82.35	2.49
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	for years now, and the question is	84.84	2.04
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	will Tesla continue to be as competitive	86.88	2.52
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	as it has in the past or
will they become outdated?	89.4	2.64
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- [Narrator] Further fueling concerns	92.04	1.32
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	are customer wait times for Tesla cars,	93.36	2.4
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	which dropped sharply over 2022.	95.76	2.52
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	Some investors see this as a sign	98.28	1.92
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	demand is already softening.	100.2	1.891
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	Musk addressed these concerns	102.091	1.649
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	on Tesla's third quarter earnings call.	103.74	2.07
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- [Musk] I can't emphasize enough.	105.81	1.89
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	We have excellent demand for Q4,	107.7	3.99
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	and we expect to sell
every car that we make	111.69	3.28
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	as far into the future as we can see.	116.1	2.13
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- [Narrator] And in December, the CEO said	118.23	1.71
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	on a Twitter Spaces call
that demand pressures	119.94	2.57
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	were driven by rising
interest rate policies.	122.51	3.52
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	Production disruptions also contributed	126.03	2.31
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	to the stock slide last year	128.34	1.62
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	leading to Tesla missing	129.96	1.44
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	its full year vehicle delivery target.	131.4	2.31
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	The EV makers said it
delivered 1.3 million vehicles	133.71	3.24
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	in 2022, up 40% from 2021.	136.95	3.18
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	That was shy of its goal
of increasing deliveries	140.13	2.13
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	by 50% or more.	142.26	1.41
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	It would've needed more than
1.4 million to hit that target.	143.67	3.81
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	News of the shortfall pushed stocks down	147.48	2.16
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	another 12% to start the new year.	149.64	2.4
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	Its largest single day decline
in more than two years.	152.04	3.48
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	Intermittent factory closures	155.52	1.35
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	at Tesla's China plant,
its largest by volume,	156.87	2.55
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	were one part of the problem.	159.42	1.68
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- China's zero COVID policy led	161.1	2.1
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	to a number of shutdowns
at its factory in Shanghai,	163.2	2.7
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	which obviously created
supply issues of its own.	165.9	2.67
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- [Narrator] Tesla also
faced issues at new factories	168.57	2.1
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	in Texas and Germany,	170.67	1.14
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	where it struggled to ramp up production.	171.81	1.92
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	Musk addressed those
problems in a May interview.	173.73	2.64
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- Both Berlin and Austin factories	176.37	2.55
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	are gigantic money furnaces right now.	178.92	3.75
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- [Narrator] Rising
supplier and logistics costs	182.67	1.89
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	combined with soaring inflation	184.56	1.56
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	contributed to these production setbacks.	186.12	2.34
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	- Tesla and every manufacturer
making EVs today is	188.46	3.75
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	confronting rapidly rising
costs from the raw materials	192.21	3.33
nZvBB1HVe4Q	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q	that go into the batteries,

8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	widely known and a lot of people believe	201.72	3.96

8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	practice so exactly what happens in this	209.34	4.5

8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	hnis what they do is that they give	213.84	3.96
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	their money to Banks like Credit Suisse	215.819	3.181
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	wealth management	217.8	3.719
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	um Credit Suisse takes that money and	219.0	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	goes and Loans it out or make	221.519	4.8
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	investments on their clients behalf now	223.44	4.859
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	if the loans that are given out if they	226.319	3.961
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	are able to collect it back or if they	228.299	3.541
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	are able to grow the investment then	230.28	3.84
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	these hnis eventually benefit now if you	231.84	3.959
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	take a look at this particular chart you	234.12	3.3
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	will see that the stock price of Credit	235.799	3.781
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Suisse was gaining new momentum and was	237.42	4.92
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	gain gaining new height up until 2007.	239.58	4.799
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	why was that the case because up until	242.34	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	2007 The Regulators were little bit	244.379	4.381
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	relaxed they were not scrutinizing the	246.78	3.48
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	banks very properly they were giving	248.76	3.559
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	like a lot of LAX treatment to banks	250.26	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	with wealth management of your client is	252.319	4.781
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	that so Banks like Credit Suisse made a	254.7	4.8
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	lot of money then 2008 crisis happened	257.1	4.62
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	and the entire world's banking system	259.5	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	somewhat collapsed so to say and there	261.72	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	was a lot of scrutiny especially on	263.94	4.08
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	large Banks like Credit Suisse and	266.16	4.02
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	therefore you are seeing that after 2008	268.02	4.2
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the downfall of Credit Suisse happened	270.18	4.32
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	along with a bunch of other Banks and	272.22	3.84
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the number one reason there was that	274.5	3.24
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	this entire wealth management practice	276.06	5.28
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	got hit very badly because the way these	277.74	5.58
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	companies or these banks used to invest	281.34	3.74
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	money in terms of loans or making	283.32	4.439
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	substandard investment that bit was	285.08	4.6
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	curtailed by Regulators then you might	287.759	3.421
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	have a natural question that okay this	289.68	3.239
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	was a system-wide regulation that came	291.18	4.079
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	in so why is it that Credit Suisse or a	292.919	4.261
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	bunch of handful of banks started	295.259	3.781
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	getting more impacted with it well	297.18	3.54
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	number one reason and was that its	299.04	2.939
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	wealth management practice was really	300.72	3.479
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	big the second reason had to do with the	301.979	4.081
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	internal dynamics of the bank for	304.199	3.901
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	example a number of CEOs were changed in	306.06	3.66
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	a quick succession so there was less	308.1	3.599
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	management stability a related Point	309.72	3.539
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	here was that Credit Suisse management	311.699	4.381
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	made a lot of shady Investments for that	313.259	4.5
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	you need to understand the story of	316.08	3.78
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	green cell which was one of the invested	317.759	4.081
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	companies of Credit Suisse and that	319.86	3.899
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	particular investment became entirely	321.84	4.139
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	dead and the company went bankrupt and	323.759	4.201
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Credit Suisse ended up losing a lot of	325.979	4.021
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	its clients money so as a result there	327.96	4.2
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	was erosion of trust and a fast downfall	330.0	4.199
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	of its wealth management business now	332.16	4.08
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	losing their investors money was not the	334.199	3.481
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	only thing that Credit Suisse was	336.24	3.36
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	dealing with they had made a bunch of	337.68	3.6
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	violations with the regulators and had	339.6	3.599
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	to pay heavy penalty I can't even count	341.28	3.479
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	how much money is this so you tell me in	343.199	3.06
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the comment box and the total number of	344.759	3.0
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	violations that they did were	346.259	3.541
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	approximately 50. so this is a fairly	347.759	4.081
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	High number of violations so to cut the	349.8	3.42
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	long story short this led to the	351.84	3.419
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	downfall of Credit Suisse and now we	353.22	3.72
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	have reached a situation where its net	355.259	4.081
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	revenues are constantly going down its	356.94	4.56
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	net as assets are constantly going down	359.34	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	so these are not healthy signs for a	361.5	4.38
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	large prominent bank that once used to	363.78	4.259
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	be the apex of the Swiss banking system	365.88	4.68
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	it is completely collapsing the final	368.039	4.561
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	nail on the coffin was the Silicon	370.56	4.079
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Valley Bank collapse so two major	372.6	4.08
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	American banks have recently collapsed	374.639	4.081
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	so as a result investors started looking	376.68	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	at the fissures that were erupting in	378.72	4.38
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	other banking systems across the globe	381.12	4.139
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	and they again Revisited the story with	383.1	3.599
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Credit Suisse and they said that you	385.259	3.0
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	know what okay American Banks going down	386.699	3.481
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	let us look at Credit Suisse and whether	388.259	3.901
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	they can pay their creditors back or not	390.18	4.32
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	and people started putting questions on	392.16	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Credit Suisse so as a result these Swiss	394.5	4.199
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Central Bank had to infuse a liquidity	396.6	4.8
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	of roughly 54 billion dollars in order	398.699	5.401
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	to infuse liquidity in Credit Suisse	401.4	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	bank so if you have understood the	404.1	4.379
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	crisis now you will say that okay and	405.84	4.199
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	you know what India is also saved stock	408.479	3.481
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	market also did not fall much American	410.039	4.141
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	crisis also seems to be over European	411.96	5.1
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Bank crisis also seems to be over so no	414.18	4.92
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	that is completely incorrect because now	417.06	4.38
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	you need to revisit the number 53	419.1	5.46
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	billion dollars and the other collateral	421.44	5.28
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	damage that other European Banks might	424.56	4.079
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	suffer so Credit Suisse is not the	426.72	3.599
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Standalone bank that was having problem	428.639	4.321
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	a bunch of other Banks also had exposure	430.319	4.081
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	to Credit Suisse and there was a little	432.96	3.359
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	bit of erosion of trust with those Banks	434.4	4.2
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	also so anyways coming to this figure of	436.319	5.22
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	53 billion dollars only now see where do	438.6	4.2
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	you think this money is coming from is	441.539	2.581
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	it like free money that you know what	442.8	3.0
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	government it decides to print whatever	444.12	3.479
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	money and they give it to like Credit	445.8	4.5
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Suisse bank and that crisis is over and	447.599	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	everything is good after that the answer	450.3	4.38
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	is no by now we all know that whenever	452.039	5.22
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the government decides to print money it	454.68	4.799
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	leads to inflation from mid to long term	457.259	4.621
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	very similar story played out in 2008	459.479	4.981
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	also when the U.S Central Bank printed a	461.88	4.319
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	lot of money and gave it to American	464.46	4.139
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	banks that year I present right and go	466.199	4.261
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	and save yourself okay great they save	468.599	3.121
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	themselves everyone thought that okay	470.46	3.72
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	crisis is over no it transpired into	471.72	4.8
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	higher inflation something again very	474.18	4.919
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	similar happened in 2020 that okay stock	476.52	4.679
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	market for all covet crisis is that	479.099	4.021
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	government again turned on the printer	481.199	4.201
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	and again there was persistent inflation	483.12	4.979
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	so this 53 billion dollars that you are	485.4	4.56
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	seeing what will this definitely lead to	488.099	3.72
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	it will lead to higher inflation where	489.96	3.72
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	especially in Europe which is already	491.819	3.78
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	dealing with very high inflation to	493.68	4.079
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	begin with now they have taken 53	495.599	3.72
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	billion dollars more and have given it	497.759	3.421
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	to Banks now this will come back and	499.319	3.6
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	hurt the common people more who are	501.18	4.139
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	already reeling under inflation now an	502.919	3.72
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	added Point here is that there is	505.319	3.121
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	nothing wrong with the ebb and flow of	506.639	3.541
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	inflation that sometimes the inflation	508.44	3.719
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	will go up then it will come down then	510.18	3.539
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	it will go up then it will come down	512.159	3.361
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	nothing wrong there but this situation	513.719	4.801
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	from 2021 onwards has been that	515.52	5.22
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	inflation has been rising and a lot of	518.52	4.139
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	work has gone into by the central banks	520.74	3.239
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	and central government in order to	522.659	3.601
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	control this High Rising inflation now	523.979	3.54
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	what has happened is that another	526.26	3.42
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	injection of 53 billion dollars have	527.519	5.341
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	been injected in 2023 at a time when	529.68	4.98
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	inflation was already high so this	532.86	3.659
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	creates a little bit of problem so now	534.66	3.179
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	you might have a natural question that	536.519	2.88
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	okay what is the precise problem in	537.839	3.801
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	terms of doing that yeah	539.399	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	and again more printing will happen	541.64	4.3
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	every time it gets solved so what is so	543.839	3.541
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	different about this okay so there are	545.94	3.18
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	two things at play so number one thing	547.38	3.36
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	is that right now you might have noticed	549.12	3.54
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	that interest rates in the economy have	550.74	3.9
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	been rising not only in India in the US	552.66	4.26
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	in Europe everywhere the central banks	554.64	3.66
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	have started to increase the interest	556.92	3.359
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	rate quite aggressively I'm not just	558.3	3.599
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	saying like a gradual rise in interest	560.279	3.421
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	rate take a look at this chart and you	561.899	3.661
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	will see how steeply the interest rates	563.7	3.84
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	have risen now what has happened is that	565.56	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	now due to banking panic and with a loss	567.54	4.979
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	of investor sentiment so to say what is	570.0	3.959
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	this going to do this is going to Dent	572.519	4.021
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	growth now in such an environment if the	573.959	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	banks or central banks all across the	576.54	3.54
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	globe they keep on raising the interest	578.399	3.661
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	rate then what is that going to do	580.08	3.9
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	further well it will derail the growth	582.06	3.899
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	further now this is something that the	583.98	4.08
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	governments all across the globe are	585.959	3.901
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	trying to prevent so therefore some	588.06	3.719
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	macroeconomics right now are predicting	589.86	3.78
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	that the governments all across the	591.779	4.081
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	globe might in fact cut the interest	593.64	4.5
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	rate or the second scenario is that they	595.86	4.32
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	might keep the interest rate plant so	598.14	3.9
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	let me very quickly show you Dr raghuram	600.18	3.839
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	rajan's commentary on this topic so I	602.04	3.239
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	will play this clip and then I will	604.019	4.081
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	share my understanding my sense is as	605.279	5.881
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	far as the interest rate measures go the	608.1	5.58
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	FED is unlikely to back off and cut	611.16	4.679
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	rates at this point given what it knows	613.68	4.92
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	but I think it is probably going to be	615.839	7.321
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	thinking 25 or 0 and uh you know events	618.6	6.239
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	till next Wednesday will determine which	623.16	4.2
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	one you you understand so Dr Rajan is of	624.839	4.741
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the view that the feds might not	627.36	4.68
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	accelerate the rate they might keep it	629.58	3.78
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	flat so you'll say that okay let's make	632.04	2.7
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	a problem if they are keeping the rates	633.36	2.82
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	flat at least they're not cutting it	634.74	3.12
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	okay so let me give you a parallel	636.18	3.0
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	example there so let's say that you know	637.86	2.88
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	what you might be having friends and	639.18	2.88
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	they are trying to build muscles in the	640.74	3.48
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	gym now there are two ways of doing it	642.06	3.66
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	one is the hardware that you go to gym	644.22	3.059
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	and you know show up every day and you	645.72	3.0
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	know pump weights and for years and	647.279	3.3
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	years and then you get muscles or option	648.72	3.42
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	two is that you start taking steroids	650.579	2.94
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	and that way your muscles will develop	652.14	3.0
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	very very quickly and let's say that you	653.519	3.121
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	have taken too many steroids now your	655.14	3.78
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	body is like bulky and doctor has told	656.64	3.54
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	you that you need to take care of your	658.92	2.64
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	health then what do you need to do you	660.18	3.0
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	need to eat clean you need to stay	661.56	2.94
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	healthy you need to probably take	663.18	3.18
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	natural products and not use steroids	664.5	3.779
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	again if you use steroids again it is	666.36	3.719
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	going to be very very harmful for your	668.279	3.481
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	health so same thing is happening that	670.079	3.601
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	cutting the interest rate is like using	671.76	4.319
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	steroids for the economy that okay once	673.68	4.2
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	in a while if you just want to prevent	676.079	4.081
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the shock in the economy it's okay to	677.88	3.84
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	bring down the interest rate but if you	680.16	3.72
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	keep on doing it over and over and over	681.72	4.739
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	again it just deteriorates the health of	683.88	4.26
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the economy so now since the world	686.459	4.021
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	economy was recovering from 2021 and	688.14	4.02
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	there was a lot of pain associated with	690.48	3.24
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	it why because of high interest rate	692.16	3.239
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	that the governments had to increase the	693.72	3.48
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	interest rate why did they have to do it	695.399	3.481
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	simply because of the fact that they	697.2	3.06
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	wanted to preserve the health of the	698.88	3.62
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	economy from a long-term perspective	700.26	5.579
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	economy so they were on the path of	702.5	5.5
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	undertaking that course of treatment by	705.839	4.321
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	increasing the interest rate but now	708.0	4.079
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	because of this banking crisis it is	710.16	5.46
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	seen by a lot of economists that a they	712.079	5.461
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	might cut the interest rate or B they	715.62	3.659
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	might keep it flat so right now both the	717.54	3.78
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	these options are bad considering the	719.279	3.781
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	long-term Health implications on the	721.32	3.48
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	economy so I hope this simple example	723.06	3.959
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	help you understand the entire context	724.8	4.68
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	as to what is happening now to	727.019	4.32
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	understand slightly more detail I am	729.48	2.76
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	presenting very complicated	731.339	2.521
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	macroeconomics I hope you are able to	732.24	3.24
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	grasp it and if you did do press the	733.86	3.0
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	like button it will support these type	735.48	2.88
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	of videos to reach out the second	736.86	3.419
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	commentary has to do with the asset	738.36	3.9
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	liability of what the central	740.279	3.961
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	governments currently hold so for	742.26	3.66
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	example this is a statement from Robert	744.24	3.779
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Hiller who is the previous fed chairman	745.92	3.359
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	please listen to it and then I'll	748.019	3.601
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	explain it and they lost a lot of money	749.279	4.68
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	on these long-term treasury Securities	751.62	5.04
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the Federal Reserve has assets of about	753.959	5.701
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	8.6 trillion dollars on the balance	756.66	6.299
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	sheet it has I'm sorry liabilities of	759.66	6.6
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	about 8.6 trillion dollars it has assets	762.959	7.741
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	of 7.4 and so it has a negative net	766.26	8.04
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	worth of about 1.1 trillion dollars	770.7	6.78
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	because it did exactly the same as	774.3	5.94
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Silicon Valley Bank did oh let's put it	777.48	4.919
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the other way around Silicon Valley Bank	780.24	4.38
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	did exactly what the Federal Reserve did	782.399	5.661
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	and therefore they both took the losses	784.62	6.6
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	as interest rates went up so basically	788.06	5.019
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	what Mr Hiller has said is very simple	791.22	4.08
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	let's see the total liabilities with the	793.079	4.621
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Central Bank of America is roughly 8.6	795.3	4.38
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	trillion dollars their assets are worth	797.7	4.62

8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	in a way in long-term maturity bonds now	802.32	4.5
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	if you actually understand the Silicon	804.839	3.601
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Valley Bank crisis again I've done a	806.82	2.819
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	separate video please go and watch it	808.44	2.16
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	you will understand a lot of	809.639	3.841
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	macroeconomics so it is exactly exactly	810.6	4.679
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	similar and there was a tweet also that	813.48	3.84
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	I done on the same topic that this	815.279	4.321
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	entire mechanism is very very similar to	817.32	4.92
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	how Silicon Valley Bank collapsed that	819.6	4.38
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	people were asking for their money Bank	822.24	3.659
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	from Silicon Valley Bank they were	823.98	3.299
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	unable to give it because they had	825.899	4.321
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	liquidity concerns this balance sheet of	827.279	4.86
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the Central Bank of America portrays	830.22	4.679
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	that same liquidity Crunch and the loss	832.139	4.26
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	or the notional loss that they are	834.899	3.901
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	facing in terms by investing in bonds so	836.399	4.261
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	theoretical if the American people	838.8	3.96
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	actually go to their central banks and	840.66	3.84
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	demand their money back they will not be	842.76	3.18

8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	from their government	847.5	3.779
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	so take a look at any Indian currency	848.899	4.601
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	note you yourself will see that it says	851.279	4.201
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	very categorically that I promise to pay	853.5	4.2

8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	represents a liability so to cut the	859.38	3.899
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	long story short right now we are in a	861.54	3.479
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	situation where America's total	863.279	3.481
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	liabilities are in excess of their	865.019	3.901
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	assets and some of their Investments or	866.76	3.48
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	rather a large chunk of their	868.92	3.78
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Investments have become bad so to cut	870.24	3.96
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the long story short this is where we	872.7	3.54
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	stand that Number One banking crisis is	874.2	3.84
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	derailing the trust of a lot of people	876.24	3.779
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	lot of investors people are asking for	878.04	4.08
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	their money back number two the central	880.019	3.901
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	banks and Central governments across	882.12	3.779
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Europe and America are deeply deeply	883.92	3.779
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	stressed and third and finally the	885.899	3.721
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	economic growth prospects of the world	887.699	4.08
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	looks bleak now you say akshat you have	889.62	4.019
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	become bearish you are change your tune	891.779	3.961
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	you are a dollar person no please let me	893.639	4.021
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	explain it to you by again taking you to	895.74	4.26
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	one of my tweets and again request that	897.66	3.96
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	if you like my content do follow me on	900.0	3.06
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Twitter I write a lot of interesting	901.62	3.42
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	stuff there so taking back to this tweet	903.06	4.2
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	so basically if you ask yourself why the	905.04	3.96
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	stock market in the last 20 years that	907.26	3.24
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	if you take Nifty returns and all the	909.0	2.76
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	stock market investors they keep on	910.5	4.38
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	saying they're on FDI 12 growth is that	911.76	5.34
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	so where does that 12 growth exactly	914.88	4.259
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	come from well historically seven	917.1	4.62
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	percent GDP growth happens in India and	919.139	4.741
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	five to six percent inflation that is	921.72	4.859
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	official so that 12 leads to stock	923.88	4.5
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	market growth now I'm not saying that	926.579	3.601
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	stock market growth will come down but	928.38	3.18
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	what is going to happen is that	930.18	2.82
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	inflation will be like seven to nine	931.56	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	percent but the GDP or forecasted GDP	933.0	5.1
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	will be roughly three percent so the	936.0	3.779
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	return will still be 12 from stock	938.1	3.66
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	market but a lot of that real return	939.779	4.201
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	what you are making it will be eaten by	941.76	4.019
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	inflation so this is the world we are	943.98	3.419
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	moving towards that we will see a	945.779	3.781
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	significant period of inflation and a	947.399	4.021
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	lot of people will unfortunately fall	949.56	4.139
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	from middle class to lower or poor	951.42	4.32
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	segment that is definitely going to	953.699	3.901
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	happen so is there something that you	955.74	4.5
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	and I can do as normal in investors so	957.6	4.32
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	this video has already become big I will	960.24	3.36
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	make a separate Community post tomorrow	961.92	3.96
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	explaining some of my strategies as to	963.6	4.32
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	how you can deal with inflation and what	965.88	3.72
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	type of Investments you can make but	967.92	3.24
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	just to quickly summarize some of these	969.6	3.299
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	steps that you could start taking so	971.16	2.88
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	here are three things that I will	972.899	3.12
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	suggest so first and foremost you must	974.04	3.78
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	learn how to survive in a sideways	976.019	3.361
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	Market in case you are a stock market	977.82	3.9
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	investor now what exactly is a sideways	979.38	4.019
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	market so for that let me take you to	981.72	3.419
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	nifty 50 chart which indicates the	983.399	3.661
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	entire sentiment of the stock market and	985.139	3.361
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	what you will notice is that right now	987.06	4.019
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	the markets are trading at 16 900 levels	988.5	5.04
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	this level existed back in September of	991.079	4.861
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	2021. so approximately markets have been	993.54	4.08
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	sideways for the last one and a half two	995.94	4.44
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	years now it is very enticing and even	997.62	4.5
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	my theory is that you know what the	1000.38	4.079
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	likely run up is supposed to happen but	1002.12	4.32
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	with these type of banking crisis what	1004.459	4.38
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	might happen is that we might continue a	1006.44	4.139
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	lot of sideways movement that we will go	1008.839	3.36
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	in a certain range only and then	1010.579	3.0
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	eventually there will be some kind of	1012.199	3.06
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	breakout and therefore it becomes	1013.579	3.541
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	important for you to learn how to trade	1015.259	4.2
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	in a sideways market so what starting is	1017.12	3.779
8KHyhYQObHc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHyhYQObHc	you can adopt I will talk about it	1019.459	3.12

hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hi everyone welcome to today's video so	0.0	4.2
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	take a look at this graphic and what you	2.34	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	would notice is that the amount of	4.2	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	carbon dioxide emission in the world it	5.7	4.5
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	has been skyrocketing this is a truly	8.22	3.839
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	staggering chart because it matches the	10.2	3.96
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	rise of cryptocurrencies and adani	12.059	4.681
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	stocks and now we have CO2 rise so this	14.16	4.619
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	is worrying the word why is that because	16.74	4.799
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	as per a lancent report it was found out	18.779	5.281
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that roughly 9 million people die every	21.539	4.201
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	year and those deaths can be	24.06	4.139
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	attributable to the air pollution now	25.74	4.68
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	just for context consider diabetes which	28.199	3.841
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	is a fairly common disease these days	30.42	4.38
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	diabetes kills roughly 1.5 million	32.04	5.22
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	people but air pollution kills 9 million	34.8	4.439
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	people now you'll say yeah I'm like you	37.26	3.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	know living in a clean environment	39.239	3.541
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	probably I'm not living in metros so why	40.44	4.56
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	does it matter to me okay so consider	42.78	4.32
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	these factors now for example consider	45.0	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	the case study of Bangladesh and what	47.1	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	you will find is that approximately 11	49.14	4.5
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	percent of Bangladesh will go underwater	51.12	5.04
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	due to rising sea level and these sea	53.64	4.439
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	levels are rising again due to the	56.16	4.32
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	increase in CO2 in the atmosphere which	58.079	4.681
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	is creating global warming consider for	60.48	4.259
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	example a Central African country called	62.76	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	as Chad there is a very important Lake	64.739	4.38
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	they are called as Lake chart and 95	66.9	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	percent of that lake has evaporated	69.119	4.441
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	again due to global warming so this	71.04	4.619
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	entire depressing scenario is bothering	73.56	3.419
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	the world the countries are coming	75.659	2.82
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	together and they are trying to figure	76.979	3.541
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	out Solutions whether or not something	78.479	4.621
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	can be done on this front a prominent	80.52	4.32
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	solution is emerging and that solution	83.1	3.659
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	is hydrogen more specifically green	84.84	4.08
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen it is creating investment	86.759	4.141
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	opportunities also it is getting the	88.92	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	entire world excited about this in the	90.9	3.96
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Indian budget this year it was announced	93.06	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that 30 000 crores are going to be	94.86	3.299
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	pumped in terms of this energy	96.78	3.839
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	transition and a large chunk of it will	98.159	4.681
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	go into green hydrogen so what	100.619	4.441
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	specifically is green hydrogen what type	102.84	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	of investment opportunities you could	105.06	3.54
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	consider are there some companies in	106.68	3.719
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	India that are experimenting with green	108.6	3.96
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen what the business model would	110.399	4.08
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	look like so this is the precise piece	112.56	3.48
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	of conversation that I am going to have	114.479	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	with you now many of you consider making	116.04	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	these type of thematic Investments	118.259	3.481
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	systematic investment means green	119.88	3.779
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen will put some money or we are	121.74	3.479
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	going to put some money in rural theme	123.659	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	or the real estate sector might go up so	125.219	3.481
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	I would want to buy some real estate	127.439	3.3
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	stocks so if you want to do these type	128.7	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	of thematic Investments do consider	130.739	3.961
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	checking some of my small cases small	132.84	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	case is a wonderful platform for you to	134.7	3.899
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	understand these theme based Investments	136.62	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	I'm linking some of my favorite small	138.599	3.481
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	cases in the comment and description box	140.28	3.539
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	you could consider checking them out so	142.08	3.239
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	let's kick start our discussion and let	143.819	3.181
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	me quickly help you understand the	145.319	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	entire context around hydrogen and green	147.0	4.86
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen what is the need what specific	149.459	4.561
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	utility does it have so I will present	151.86	3.9
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	some technical details but I'll try to	154.02	3.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	simplify it so if you're not from a	155.76	3.42
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	science background do not get scared I	157.2	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	will try to present this information in	159.18	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	a very simple format so the first key	160.86	3.48
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	term that you need to understand is a	162.54	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	term called as decarbonization so	164.34	3.539
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	decarbonization in very easy to	166.2	3.48
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	understand term means that in the	167.879	3.901
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	atmosphere the amount of CO2 has	169.68	4.199
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	increased quite aggressively now why has	171.78	3.9
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	CO2 increased in the world well there	173.879	3.961
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	are several reasons at play for example	175.68	4.139
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	vehicle or pollution the release of meat	177.84	4.38
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	thin gas the type of gadgets equipments	179.819	4.741
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that we are using etc etc now when CO2	182.22	4.68
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	increases in the environment it traps a	184.56	4.08
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	lot of heat why does it trap it all that	186.9	3.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	chemistry we don't need to know simple	188.64	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Point either CO2 is increasing then the	190.08	3.96
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	heat that will be absorbed will be high	192.42	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	so as a result the global temperature is	194.04	3.9
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	rising and it is creating a bunch of	196.14	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Havoc that I was speaking about so	197.94	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	decarbonization simply means that you	199.8	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	are bringing this carbon intensity down	201.78	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that is the simple concept behind	203.94	4.019
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	decarbonization now what is the primary	205.8	4.26
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	mode of achieving this decarbonization	207.959	3.721
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	it is very simple and you will find the	210.06	3.539
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	answer here generally this involves	211.68	4.26
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	decreasing CO2 output per unit of	213.599	4.681
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	electricity generated so let's say that	215.94	4.32
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	you are taking 1 kg of coal and you are	218.28	3.48
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	turning this into electricity that you	220.26	3.059
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	will burn this in a thermal power plant	221.76	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and with this 1 kg of coal you are able	223.319	4.56
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	to generate let's say one megawatt of	226.2	3.599
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	energy or electricity now these numbers	227.879	3.42
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	can be way off I'm just helping you	229.799	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	understand the concept now what is the	231.299	3.781
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	goal here is that let's say this is 1 kg	233.159	4.921
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	of goal used to produce like 500 kgs of	235.08	5.939
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	CO2 now under D carbonate what is the	238.08	5.579
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	goal that instead of using 1 kg of coal	241.019	4.86
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	you use some other material and what	243.659	4.201
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that does is that it still generates one	245.879	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	megawatt of electricity because the	247.86	3.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	world needs electricity or different	249.599	3.901
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	forms of energies but the goal becomes	251.04	4.979
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that instead of generating 500 kgs of	253.5	5.579
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	CO2 you are now generating maybe 250 kgs	256.019	4.921
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	of CO2 so this is called as reducing	259.079	4.201
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	carbon intensity now if you look at sub	260.94	4.259
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	steps or methods through which this can	263.28	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	be accomplished so roughly speaking	265.199	3.661
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	there are seven specific methods for	266.94	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	example you can do electrification with	268.86	4.38
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	storage so these are called as off-grid	271.08	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Solutions there can be heat pumps there	273.24	4.019
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	can be waste heat recovery there are	275.52	4.2
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	green gas and biogas generation of	277.259	4.321
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	electricity that can be done there can	279.72	3.06
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	be hydrogen so different different	281.58	2.64
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	methods are there now this is not a	282.78	2.76
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	science class so I will not get into	284.22	3.3
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	each of these but I will help you unpack	285.54	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	the hydrogen method so let's speak more	287.52	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	about that okay so to understand the	289.56	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen story let us pick the hydrogen	291.3	4.8
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	based cars versus electric vehicles now	293.4	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	for example right now you might be	296.1	3.06
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hearing that you know what so many cars	297.54	3.68
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	taxis are	299.16	4.88
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	it's clean it's good for the environment	301.22	5.32
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	but problem with electric vehicles and	304.04	4.12
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	there are a bunch of problems but one of	306.54	3.06
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	the primary problems in terms of	308.16	3.0
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	electric vehicle is that you have to	309.6	3.599
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	change the entire infrastructure second	311.16	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	key point is that the charging time is	313.199	3.961
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	fairly high for electric vehicle and if	315.3	3.48
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	you charge your electric vehicle once	317.16	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	probably it will go up to 100 kilometers	318.78	4.199
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	now in the hydrogen system what is being	320.94	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	touted is that you don't need to replace	322.979	4.261
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and build an entirely new infrastructure	324.6	5.039
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	from scratch a lot of it has to be built	327.24	4.32
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	but a lot of it can be built from the	329.639	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	existing system that is already there	331.56	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	now this is being applied not only in	333.479	4.141
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	the car or automobile space this is	335.58	3.839
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	being applied in the Gas Distribution	337.62	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	space Also for example if you are living	339.419	3.661
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	in Delhi or several bunch of Metro	341.28	3.9
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	cities in India you would be seeing that	343.08	3.959
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	there is a gas pipeline now these type	345.18	4.079
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	of gas pipelines are fairly common in	347.039	4.201
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Western countries so let me show you a	349.259	3.841
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	very quick Point as to how the UK	351.24	3.6
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	government is experimenting with this	353.1	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen space when it comes to Gas	354.84	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Distribution so this is what they say	356.82	4.62
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that by 2032 2 the UK Gas Distribution	358.56	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	network will be predominantly	361.44	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	polyethylene pipe that is capable of	363.0	5.16
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	transporting hydrogen we won't need a	365.16	4.86
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	parallel system at a distribution level	368.16	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	so this is the primary advantage of	370.02	4.2
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	moving to hydrogen based systems be it	372.18	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	in form of Gas Distribution or	374.22	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	automobiles or building public transport	375.84	4.079
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	so the application of the hydrogen	377.94	3.96
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	system might not involve the complete	379.919	4.5
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	overhaul of the de facto or the existing	381.9	4.859
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	systems that already exist now just to	384.419	3.9
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	help you understand the entire context	386.759	3.06
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	you can go and read this particular	388.319	3.421
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	block where I have given the pros and	389.819	4.261
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	cons of using EV based automobiles	391.74	4.079
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	versus hydrogen based automobiles again	394.08	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	I don't want to make this a chemistry	395.819	3.241
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	class but this will help you understand	397.44	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	the primary pros and cons across both	399.06	4.079
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	now realizing this potential companies	401.16	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	like Toyota have already experimented in	403.139	4.141
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this space and recently the news came	405.3	3.6
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	out that one of the cars that Toyota	407.28	4.74
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	design it was able to travel 1003	408.9	5.34
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	kilometers with one single charge now	412.02	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this type of application is not	414.24	3.899
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	currently yet possible in the EV segment	415.86	3.779
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	there are other countries Like a Stone	418.139	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that are building their public transport	419.639	4.141
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	system by using hydrogen based	421.979	3.421
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	technology now I am not from a science	423.78	3.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	background so I might have made a couple	425.4	2.88
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	of mistakes here and there so please	426.96	3.179
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	pardon that my intent is to just	428.28	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	simplify the investing side of things	430.139	3.421
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and explain you the technology and	432.0	3.539
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	application behind it rather than going	433.56	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	into hardcore chemistry and science so	435.539	3.241
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that is the intent with which I am	437.22	3.0
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	covering this topic so then comes the	438.78	3.06
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	natural question that okay India make a	440.22	2.94
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Cena and what is the Indian government	441.84	3.24
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	doing in this particular space so okay	443.16	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	couple of things there one is that India	445.08	4.019
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	is going to spend a lot of money there	447.18	3.419
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	are budget allocations that have been	449.099	3.961
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	done which is in tune of 35 000 crore	450.599	5.16
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	out of this approximately 20 000 crore	453.06	4.919
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	is going for green hydrogen now you'll	455.759	3.481
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	say green hydrogen is there a pink	457.979	3.0
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen is there a gray hydrogen yes	459.24	3.42
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	there are pink hydrogen gray hydrogen	460.979	4.081
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and women hydrogens again we don't need	462.66	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	to become chemistry ninjas and	465.06	2.579
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	understand what is pyrolysis	466.44	3.24
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	electrolysis this that no you don't need	467.639	4.021
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	to get into all this I read all of that	469.68	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	stuff to prepare for today's video so	471.66	3.06
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	please press the like button I know that	473.34	3.12
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	you haven't done it please do it now so	474.72	3.24
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	to cut the long story short don't worry	476.46	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	about electrolysis pyrolysis just take a	477.96	3.9
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	look at this particular snippet it will	480.12	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	give you a basic overview of what gray	481.86	3.839
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen is what a turquoise hydrogen	483.78	3.96
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	what is green hydrogen in very easy to	485.699	4.021
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	understand term green hydrogen is green	487.74	3.899
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen and gray hydrogen is not clean	489.72	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen it is based on non-renewable	491.639	4.321
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	sources of energy and green hydrogen is	493.74	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	based on renewable source of energy now	495.96	3.359
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	you might say that okay this looks like	497.88	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	an amazing technology so why is it that	499.319	3.901
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	we even have EV countries just simply	501.24	3.6
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	move to Green hydrogen that is the same	503.22	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	question I also had in my head so I	504.84	3.6
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	researched more and this is what I was	506.94	3.599
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	able to find let's see green hydrogen is	508.44	3.719
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	not the ultimate thing there are a bunch	510.539	3.12
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	of problems associated with green	512.159	3.24
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen right from Storage to	513.659	3.721
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Transportation one of the key problems	515.399	4.08
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	is that it is highly inflammable and	517.38	3.839
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	these days a lot of Ola scooters are	519.479	3.24
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	getting busted due to battery issues	521.219	3.421
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that is not even hydrogen so from that	522.719	3.541
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	particular perspective a lot of	524.64	3.48
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	challenges are there that will hopefully	526.26	3.54
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	get solved with time this is an	528.12	3.659
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	up-and-coming technology and like any	529.8	3.9
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	technology it will have its own set of	531.779	4.921
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	advantages disadvantages and challenges	533.7	4.98
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and opportunities for growth so in this	536.7	4.139
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	context the Indian government has built	538.68	4.56
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	a green hydrogen Mission now this is	540.839	4.321
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	like a 30 40 pager that you have to go	543.24	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and read I will link it in the	545.16	3.06
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	description box if you feel like reading	546.6	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	it please read it now in that document	548.22	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	big big things have been said that you	550.38	2.82
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	know we'll change this we'll change that	551.88	2.94
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	bunch of good good things which is very	553.2	3.48
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	nice also but you need to get to the	554.82	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	core or practical part of that so the	556.68	3.779
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Practical part I have picked it here and	558.66	3.359
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	what the Indian government is saying is	560.459	3.541
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that you know what our focus is green	562.019	4.081
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen we want to become cleaner we	564.0	4.019
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	want to support the environment all good	566.1	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	good things we want to do and we have a	568.019	4.021
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	vision for it we are budgeting but	569.88	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	please realize that we will launch this	572.04	3.96
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	mission in a phased manner now what is	573.72	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	the meaning of phased manner phase	576.0	3.12
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	manner says that for example imagine	577.56	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that this is 1950 and one of the	579.12	3.719
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	government says that you know what we	581.7	3.0
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	are going to send humans to Moon we	582.839	3.301
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	cannot just simply make that claim and	584.7	2.819
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	go away first they will say that okay	586.14	2.94
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	phase one is that we'll build some kind	587.519	3.181
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	of space rocket second phase is that	589.08	3.0
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	we'll find some astronauts who are	590.7	3.24
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	willing to go and risk their life and we	592.08	3.319
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	will train them then third phase is	593.94	3.899
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	fourth phase is this and that so I hope	595.399	4.861
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	you got the picture that that is how in	597.839	4.861
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	so right now phase one is very very	600.26	4.42
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	basic and what they are simply saying is	602.7	5.04
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this that utilization of hydrogen in the	604.68	5.52
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	refineries fertilizer City Gas sector	607.74	4.32
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this is where we will focus so the	610.2	3.06
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	summary point is that the Indian	612.06	3.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	government is at an Inception point when	613.26	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	it comes to this particular technology	615.24	3.539
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and it is trying to find applications	616.98	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and it is starting small so just this	618.779	4.201
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	particular paragraph should somewhat	621.12	3.719
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	forewarn you that please don't get super	622.98	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	excited about the space that you know	624.839	3.361
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	what if I invest in like green nitrogen	626.7	3.42
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	based companies I am going to double my	628.2	3.6
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	money in one year or two year it might	630.12	3.48
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	might not happen so from that context	631.8	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	let us study about four or five key	633.6	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	companies in this particular space that	635.58	4.68
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	might or might not benefit due to this	638.04	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	green hydrogen thing so the first	640.26	3.06
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	company that I will briefly talk about	641.76	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	is the adani group I'm not saying adani	643.32	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	green I'm saying adani group because	645.6	3.479
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	it's a conglomerate family office one	646.98	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	company is that can be passed on to the	649.079	3.301
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	other and all that stuff can happen so	650.7	3.54
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	it's better to study adani group rather	652.38	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	than individual set of companies so this	654.24	3.42
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	is the Declaration that you can still	656.16	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	find on the adani groups website and	657.66	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	what they say is that you know what they	659.88	3.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	are doing a bunch of stuff that they are	661.5	3.24
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	going to invest like 20 billion dollars	663.06	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and almost 75 percent of grouped planned	664.74	4.62
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	capital expenditure will be in green	667.5	3.899
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	business now all these are fairly big	669.36	4.26
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	points one of their prominent Partners	671.399	4.261
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	when it comes to this green energy space	673.62	4.5
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	was a company called as total energy it	675.66	4.679
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	was planning to do joint projects worth	678.12	4.68
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	50 billion dollars and this was a fairly	680.339	4.5
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	big amount but they have now backed out	682.8	3.599
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and this is a fairly recent news that	684.839	3.301
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	they are not going to go on this joint	686.399	3.601
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	venture program with a Rani group their	688.14	3.48
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	CEO has simply said that you know what I	690.0	3.24
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	did not sign any contract I am out of	691.62	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this now in case you want to read that	693.24	3.539
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	entire statement I'm linking it here and	694.98	3.24
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this is an important paragraph that	696.779	3.361
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	adani has other things to deal with now	698.22	3.54
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and this is in quotation it means that	700.14	3.12
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this is the statement that is coming	701.76	4.199
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	from their CEO adani has other things to	703.26	4.319
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	deal with it now it's just good sense to	705.959	3.241
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	pause things while the audit goes	707.579	3.481
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	forward so this is the statement that	709.2	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	has come and it is highly unlikely that	711.06	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	they are going to jump back into this	712.98	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	deal anytime soon so if you had invested	714.42	4.68
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	in adani group of companies that India	717.12	4.159
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	is going to	719.1	2.179
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this is that please be a little bit	721.82	4.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	careful do not try to play that game	724.2	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that is not a fundamental game it might	726.18	4.5
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	might not happen and if you get stuck	728.64	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	you will not even be able to get out of	730.68	3.3
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that stock now this is the statement	732.66	2.94
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that has come from Reliance and they	733.98	3.299
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	have said that we aim to transition to	735.6	4.08
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Green hydrogen production from Green now	737.279	5.941
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	by 2025. the company aims to reduce the	739.68	5.76
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	production cost of green hydrogen to	743.22	4.26
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	under 1 kg and all this stuff is there	745.44	3.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that they have figured out some	747.48	4.5
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Partnerships they're signing mousse but	748.62	5.279
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	please consider this that the focus of	751.98	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Reliance group is fairly simple now	753.899	4.921
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	their primary focus is to move away from	756.0	5.16
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	oil based business or energy based	758.82	4.38
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	business into more digital based	761.16	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	business that is where they are finding	763.2	4.079
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	success jio platform is a technology	764.94	4.98
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	company Facebook Google meta all these	767.279	3.721
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	different different companies Silver	769.92	2.88
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Lake partners that has invested in	771.0	4.139
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Reliance in its recent rally they are	772.8	4.26
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	all tech companies so please be a little	775.139	3.661
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	bit considerate and understand number	777.06	4.079
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	one point that Reliance is what type of	778.8	4.86
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	a company it used to be a heavy oil	781.139	4.861
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	based company energy-based company which	783.66	4.7
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	has now made a strategic shift to go to	786.0	4.98
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	technology-based businesses and within	788.36	4.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	their energy-based business they are	790.98	2.82
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	saying that you know what we will move	792.54	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	to Green energy based projects and green	793.8	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen is one of the core areas we are	796.2	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	looking at now this can also be	798.24	3.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	understood by looking at the revenue	799.92	3.539
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	streams of the Reliance group as of now	801.42	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	so if you consider this particular chart	803.459	4.261
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	you will be very impressed seeing oil to	805.56	4.32
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	chemicals is roughly 57 of groups	807.72	3.9
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	business so at one point in time this	809.88	4.32
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	used to be 90 plus so over time it is	811.62	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	coming down and going forward this	814.2	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	entire pie is going to shrink more of	815.76	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this pie will come from the technology	818.04	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	business so according to me again I	819.54	4.5
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	would personally not put any money in	821.88	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Reliance group from the Viewpoint that I	824.04	4.08
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	am bullish about the green energy space	826.32	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	So yeah so that is my viewpoint please	828.12	3.779
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	do your further research now the third	830.1	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	company is called as iocl this is a	831.899	3.601
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	public sector entity and there is	833.88	3.959
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	another company called as ongc both are	835.5	4.2
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	working towards promoting the green	837.839	4.081
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen green energy agenda of the	839.7	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Indian government which is good thing	841.92	3.3
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	also so let's look at specific plants	843.36	4.08
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that they have so for example iocl has	845.22	3.6
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	given the statement that they are	847.44	4.26
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	targeting to replace at least a tenth of	848.82	5.22
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	its current fossil fuel based hydrogen	851.7	4.079
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	at its Refinery with its green	854.04	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	counterpart second key point is that	855.779	3.421
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this is just a Target so even if they do	857.7	3.0
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	like maybe two percent so they can	859.2	3.24
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	probably do that also the third key	860.7	3.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	point that you need to understand is	862.44	2.76
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that when it comes to companies like	863.88	4.199
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	iocl or ongc basically their business	865.2	4.86
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	model is extraction of oil and	868.079	4.141
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	processing it so to say they are not the	870.06	5.04
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	end distributors in form of the products	872.22	4.559
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that will be built on the green energy	875.1	3.539
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	format for example if you compare	876.779	4.021
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	something like iocl with Toyota so	878.639	4.38
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Toyota is manufacturing a car which	880.8	4.38
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	might use hydrogen cell now that is	883.019	4.5
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	being given to the end consumer directly	885.18	4.8
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	there are margins associated with that	887.519	4.801
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	but when you are supplying just oil that	889.98	4.08
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	acts as a basic order to build more	892.32	4.019
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	products on it you become like a low	894.06	4.26
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	margin product additional problem here	896.339	3.541
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	would be that the government is going to	898.32	3.54
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	set rules that for example right now the	899.88	4.199
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	government tells the discom units or the	901.86	3.839
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	electricity producers that this is the	904.079	3.481
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	price at which you can sell electricity	905.699	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	similarly when green energy gets	907.56	4.32
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	produced what is it that the government	909.839	3.421
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	will say they'll say that you know what	911.88	3.3
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	we gave you like 20 000 crore of subsidy	913.26	4.079
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	time to give us back so this is the	915.18	3.779
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	price at which you will be able to sell	917.339	3.481
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	so that profit margin will never be	918.959	4.141
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	there and again if I'm buying iocl or	920.82	4.379
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	ongc because of this green energy thing	923.1	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	I will just not do that now comes the	925.199	3.781
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	final company which is a small cap	927.54	3.419
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	company which is a company that I am	928.98	3.719
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	considering investing in and it is	930.959	4.801
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	called as MTAR Tech now please note down	932.699	5.341
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	my word that I am considering investing	935.76	4.379
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	in it whether I am going to invest in it	938.04	4.26
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	or not invest in it as of now I have not	940.139	4.5
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	made a final call so far it looks okay	942.3	4.38
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	I'm going to monitor it but let me very	944.639	4.2
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	quickly take you through what MTAR does	946.68	4.32
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	so here's the revenue breakup of the	948.839	3.961
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	company basically it is into Precision	951.0	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	instrument now what are Precision	952.8	3.539
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Instruments Precision Instruments in	954.36	3.659
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	very easy to understand term means that	956.339	3.481
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	for example if you consider nuclear	958.019	4.26
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	reactor the parts that go into building	959.82	6.0
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	a nuclear reactor it can create havoc in	962.279	5.701
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	case something goes off so you need very	965.82	3.48
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	precise instrument that is what	967.98	2.94
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Precision instrument means so the	969.3	3.12
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	company makes these type of instruments	970.92	3.18
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and it is believed that this company	972.42	3.599
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	might actually benefit from this green	974.1	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen Revolution that is coming in	976.019	3.781
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	India and the world so let us quickly	977.94	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	understand about this company and its	979.8	3.719
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	business structure as of now what you	981.6	5.4
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	will notice is that almost 67 of its	983.519	5.281
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	business comes from the green energy	987.0	4.74
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	space almost 17 from nuclear almost 12	988.8	5.099
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	percent from space and defense etc etc	991.74	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	now if you study the investor holding	993.899	3.781
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	what you will notice is that fiis and	995.88	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	DIYs both have increased their stake	997.68	3.599
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	which is a healthy sign for such company	999.54	5.099
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and good FIS and Eis have purchased the	1001.279	5.581
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	stake in this company so this is good	1004.639	3.901
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this is definitely a healthy positive	1006.86	3.539
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	sign no doubt about that now third key	1008.54	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	point is around the debt to equity of	1010.399	4.081
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	the company that this has a debt of	1012.56	5.279
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	approximately 25 on its Equity this is	1014.48	5.82
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	not a really bad sign for two reasons so	1017.839	4.261
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this is a small company this is not a	1020.3	3.599
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	very large company to begin with and	1022.1	3.479
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	second key point is that this company is	1023.899	3.241
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	expanding right now it is in a very	1025.579	3.961
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	recent state so to say it ipoed last	1027.14	3.9
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	year it has been existing for last	1029.54	3.419
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	several years so therefore it requires	1031.04	3.6
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	to put in a lot of fixed capital in	1032.959	3.12
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	terms of building capacity which	1034.64	3.12
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	eventually will help it generate its	1036.079	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	cash flow so to cut the long story short	1037.76	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this is a Nissan company which actually	1039.439	3.661
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	genuinely requires debt no doubt about	1041.12	3.839
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that so from that perspective there are	1043.1	3.54
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	no major red flags here you will again	1044.959	3.781
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	see that you know what 6.89 is in price	1046.64	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	promoter holding see this is an r d	1048.74	5.1
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	based business so they need very fast	1051.08	4.62
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Capital they need to raise Capital quite	1053.84	4.199
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	aggressively this will always be a major	1055.7	3.96
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	problem in these type of businesses	1058.039	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that's one second key major problem with	1059.66	4.379
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this business is that right now it is in	1062.059	4.561
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that price Discovery Space it ipoed last	1064.039	4.561
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	year so the price has dance around it	1066.62	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	has come back to almost the same level	1068.6	4.38
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	at which it ipoed so price Discovery is	1070.28	4.38
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	still taking place third and the biggest	1072.98	3.6
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	risk in this business is that it is	1074.66	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	highly dependent on one single USB	1076.58	5.099
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	client so that one single us-based	1079.1	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	client is a company called as Bloom	1081.679	3.841
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Energy which is into making clean	1083.24	4.26
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	reliable and affordable energy for	1085.52	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	everyone on Earth so this is a fairly	1087.5	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	wide Mission now if something happens to	1089.36	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this particular company then of course	1091.28	4.259
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	it is going to hit empty AR Technologies	1093.08	4.5
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	as well and it will suffer quite badly	1095.539	3.961
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this is called as Revenue concentration	1097.58	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	risk which is fairly high from this	1099.5	4.08
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	current company so am I going to invest	1101.36	4.319
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	in this company right away no I'm just	1103.58	3.599
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	going to wait and watch a little bit and	1105.679	3.301
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	then I will make a final call on it I	1107.179	3.421
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	will give my commentary on the member	1108.98	3.42
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Community tab you would consider joining	1110.6	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that section so in summary this is what	1112.4	3.72
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	I will say about green hydrogen and	1114.26	4.14
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	green energy space that number one the	1116.12	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	commercial application or commercial	1118.4	4.2
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	viability of these projects is fairly	1119.96	5.099
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	far-fetched as of now it is unlikely	1122.6	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	that the companies that are	1125.059	2.941
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	experimenting in this space are going to	1126.26	3.96
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	make crazy money right off the bat a lot	1128.0	4.02
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	of money first needs to flow in r d	1130.22	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	needs to get figured out products need	1132.02	3.84
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	to get billed and tested so we are very	1134.0	3.96
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	far off from this point number two is	1135.86	4.199
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this space needed absolutely hundred	1137.96	3.839
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	percent this space is needed and I am	1140.059	3.12
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	really hoping that in terms of	1141.799	3.0
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	innovation timelines it will get	1143.179	3.661
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	accelerated and some big company comes	1144.799	4.081
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	picks up the mantle and actually makes	1146.84	3.78
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	commercially viable project in the space	1148.88	3.659
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	and our Humanity will benefit from it	1150.62	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	third if you are looking to make	1152.539	3.241
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	investments in green energy green	1153.98	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	hydrogen space make Diversified	1155.78	4.259
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	Investments and be very clear as to what	1157.64	4.44
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	specifically will you track for example	1160.039	4.201
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	if you are investing in MTAR technology	1162.08	4.74
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	please be worried about their revenue	1164.24	4.62
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	concentration risk that are they	1166.82	3.54
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	expanding their revenue through	1168.86	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	different customers if they are doing it	1170.36	3.66
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	then probably it might make a lot more	1172.22	4.26
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	sense then to invest in this company as	1174.02	4.56
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	of now I would avoid I hope you got my	1176.48	3.6
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	perspective and I hope that you enjoyed	1178.58	3.36
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	this video if you did do press the like	1180.08	4.88
hzTN-DE8sRQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTN-DE8sRQ	button and I will see you soon	1181.94	3.02

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and foremost quickly understand what is	149.76	3.54
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the meaning of index so index in very	151.379	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	simple term means that it is a unit of	153.3	4.14
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	measure so to say for example if you	155.34	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	have to figure out that how much germi	157.44	3.06
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	it is then what are you going to check	159.06	2.759
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you are going to check the temperature	160.5	2.819
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and that temperature becomes Celsius	161.819	3.241
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	right so in India we measure temperature	163.319	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	as per celsius if it is 45 degree	165.06	4.319
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	temperature like something in Delhi NCR	167.28	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	then it is fairly hot if it is like	169.379	3.901
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	minus one degree something like Shimla	171.48	3.3
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	or Manali then it is fairly cool	173.28	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	similarly in the stock market also we	174.78	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	have these reference point called as	177.0	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	indices now in India there are various	178.5	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	types of indices for example one of the	180.78	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	most popular index is called as nifty 50	183.0	4.98
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	now now this is the collection of top 50	185.34	4.979
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies by market weight so you will	187.98	4.44
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	have companies like HDFC Bank company	190.319	5.401
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Reliance TCS all these companies make a	192.42	6.179
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	part of the top 50 stocks in India and	195.72	5.28
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	if you go and make a briefcase of these	198.599	5.161
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies then it is called as Nifty 50.	201.0	5.159
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	similarly another popular index On The	203.76	5.22
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Rise is called as Nifty next 50. so this	206.159	4.86
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	comprises of companies which are ranked	208.98	4.619
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	from 51 to almost 100 and this becomes	211.019	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	another type of index then you have	213.599	3.541
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	something called as Nifty bank for	215.519	3.0
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example this would have companies like	217.14	3.239
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	SBI it would be given a certain weight	218.519	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you will have HDFC Bank you will have	220.379	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	kotek Mahindra bank so all these Banks	222.299	3.901
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	if you go and create a briefcase it	224.22	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	becomes an index same goes for Nifty it	226.2	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and there have been a bunch of	228.48	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	categorizations that have been done so	230.28	3.959
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to cut the long story short in India we	232.08	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	have a bunch of indices so I hope this	234.239	3.601
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	first point is clear that what exactly	236.28	3.3
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is the meaning of index and how many	237.84	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	types of indices are there in India then	239.58	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	comes the second natural question that	241.68	3.54
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	okay why is it that index investing is	243.18	4.38
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	getting more popular with time and is	245.22	4.019
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	there any specific advantage to index	247.56	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investing now I don't want to make this	249.239	3.601
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	a basic video I will discuss the news	250.92	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	item that I have to talk about the adani	252.84	3.959
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	piece but this important basic	254.76	3.719
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	information needs to be given so I'll be	256.799	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	quick here see basically the reason why	258.479	4.381
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	index investing has grown in popularity	260.519	4.381
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is very simple and you need to think	262.86	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	about it from Simplicity point of view	264.9	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	so the first key reason is that index	266.82	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investing is simple for example if you	268.86	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	do not know much about stock picking you	270.84	3.359
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	don't want to spend too much time in it	272.82	2.819
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	then what are you going to do most	274.199	3.481
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	likely that you will simply go buy nifty	275.639	4.261
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	50 companies now with what psychology	277.68	4.14
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	will you be investing in it you will be	279.9	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investing with the psychology I don't	281.82	4.14
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	know much about stock picking if I am	283.74	4.56

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	India and that philosophy is absolutely	291.66	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	right now let's further delve deeper	294.18	3.959
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	into that psychology when you're saying	296.22	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that you know what I'm getting exposure	298.139	4.56

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that is going on in your mind as a	302.699	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Layman most likely your thinking as a	304.259	4.22
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	beginner is that okay top 50 companies	306.419	5.34
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	for example TCS okay for example HDFC	308.479	5.081
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Bank all these are good good companies	311.759	3.981
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and worst case scenarios	313.56	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	I'm not taking exposure to small cap	315.74	4.06
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Medicap for two companies and all that	318.12	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	I'm investing in top top companies so I	319.8	4.44
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	will at least be able to preserve my	322.38	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	capital and if I keep on doing this	324.24	4.5

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	very low and number three if I take a	330.84	4.139
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	look at the 20-year historic tagger of	332.759	4.081
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	nifty fifty it comes out to be around 12	334.979	4.921
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	so my money has grown in nifty 50 at a	336.84	5.639
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	rapid pace so analyzing all this piece	339.9	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of information you will get very	342.479	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	impressed that okay this nifty 50 is a	343.8	4.98
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	good sensible sea fish instrument same	346.139	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	goes for Nifty next 50 you will see that	348.78	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	okay fine your body company I have	350.699	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	invested now let me go and take a little	352.74	4.019
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	bit of risk but these still remain the	354.479	4.861
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	top 100 companies in India so to say so	356.759	4.261
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	maybe investing my money here is	359.34	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	sensible now third you will think of it	361.02	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	in a similar way that okay Bank Nifty	363.36	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	may find taking exposure then probably I	365.22	4.319

zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	India so that is the philosophy with	369.539	4.321
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	which people invest in Index this is	371.759	3.421
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	something that no one is going to	373.86	3.3
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	explain it to you but I hope that you	375.18	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	understood this subtle point because	377.16	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	this is where the story gets shaped up	378.66	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	so let's move over to the story with	380.52	4.019
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	adanis as to what is happening and why	382.38	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is so much who Allah is happening in the	384.539	4.021
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	market because adani stocks are getting	386.46	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	imbibed into this index so in regards to	388.56	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the adani stock what has happened is	390.96	4.38
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that NSE has decided to include several	392.52	5.1
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of the adani stocks to several new	395.34	5.04
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	indices and old indices so approximately	397.62	5.639
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	14 indices have been defined where adani	400.38	5.159
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	stocks will find certain weight this	403.259	4.38
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	includes nifty 50 this includes Nifty	405.539	4.681
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and x50 this includes Nifty top 100 so I	407.639	3.721
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	will take you through the list in a	410.22	3.0
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	minute but let me quickly explain this	411.36	3.24
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	entire piece without making it	413.22	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	controversial so basically what happens	414.6	5.219
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is that NSE does a semi-annual review of	416.58	5.339
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the entire indices that are present in	419.819	4.681
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	India they Define and develop a certain	421.919	4.321
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	methodology they will say that for	424.5	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example nifty 50 if I have to define a	426.24	4.98
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	certain company then the criteria of	428.58	5.04
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	defining it could be market cap plus	431.22	4.199
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	there will be criteria two that needs to	433.62	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	be met third criteria should be	435.419	3.661
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	something something so whichever company	437.1	4.379
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	meets this list it ends up becoming a	439.08	4.98
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	part of nifty 50. so till here the story	441.479	4.62
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is fine that okay automatically they are	444.06	4.16
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	creating some methodology	446.099	4.861
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that becomes a relevant company for that	448.22	4.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	particular index but the problem is that	450.96	4.079
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	new indices can also be built for	453.0	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example most of us would not have heard	455.039	3.481
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of an index in India it is called as	456.78	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Nifty Sharia 25 so have you heard of it	458.52	4.14
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	honestly tell me and take a look at the	460.8	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	methodology of developing that index so	462.66	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	these type of methodologies can be used	464.88	4.379
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and new indices can be built and a lot	466.62	4.799
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of companies can find their place in	469.259	3.901
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	these type of new indices now to	471.419	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	understand part two of the problem you	473.16	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	need to understand how active investing	475.139	4.201
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Works versus passive investing and to	477.06	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	help you wrap your brain around it let	479.34	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	me use some practical examples from this	481.08	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	list so here is a list of mutual funds	482.94	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that have exposure to adani group stocks	484.86	3.899
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	for example you will see some of the	487.02	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	mutual funds as Edelweiss Arbitrage fund	488.759	5.22
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	regular growth and if you go and compare	491.52	4.86
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	it with something like Nippon India ETF	493.979	4.981
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Nifty 50bs now you might say that you	496.38	4.319
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	know what this fund one and this fund	498.96	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	two both have exposure to adani stocks	500.699	4.141
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and the fund manager is making an	502.8	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	arbitrary decision in terms of investing	504.84	4.859
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	in that no so a bunch of mutual funds	507.36	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	work very very differently for example	509.699	5.28
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Edelweiss Arbitrage fund is actually an	511.86	5.52
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	actively managed mutual fund so actively	514.979	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	manage simply means when the fund	517.38	3.42
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	manager let's say that you pay them 1000	518.94	4.019
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	rupees they will take that money and	520.8	4.38
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	then they will make a choice whether to	522.959	4.261
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	invest in adani stocks and bunch of	525.18	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	other stocks or not so they get a choice	527.22	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that whether they should be investing in	529.92	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	avani stocks or not on the flip side	531.48	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	when it comes to these nifty 50 type of	533.88	4.86
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	funds then here the fund manager does	536.16	4.799
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	not get that choice of investing in	538.74	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	adani group of companies it is	540.959	3.601
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	automatically designed that way why	542.82	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	because here you are giving the fund	544.56	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	manager and telling him that you know	546.6	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what here is my 1000 rupee take it and	548.22	4.92
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	go and invest in nifty 50 companies now	550.44	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	if adani group makes a part of that	553.14	4.139
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	nifty 50 companies then automatically	555.18	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	your money gets invested into adani	557.279	3.781
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	group so just to recap this major	559.38	3.42
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	problem what exactly is happening is	561.06	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	let's see NSC has built a bunch of	562.8	5.76
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	indices and many of the novice investors	565.08	5.28
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	are what they are thinking that okay not	568.56	3.24
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	if I go and pick something like let's	570.36	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	say nifty 50 or if I go and pick Nifty	571.8	5.099
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	next 50 but unfortunately what ends up	574.62	3.839
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	happening is that your money gets	576.899	3.421
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	passively invested into certain	578.459	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies where you might not want to	580.32	4.139
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	build any positions so this becomes a	582.42	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	slight issue now you might give me a	584.459	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	counter argument that okay NSC BSC might	586.14	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	be aware of it CB might be aware of it	588.3	3.659
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	they might be doing something to	590.16	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	counteract this situation well	591.959	3.901
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	unfortunately the way the adani story	593.76	4.44
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	has played out it is not as if that NSE	595.86	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	BSE CV are not cognizant of it but	598.2	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	actually what has happened is that this	600.6	3.54
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	methodology of building new indices and	601.98	4.44
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	giving adani companies weight into these	604.14	4.379
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	different indices this evaluation was	606.42	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	done as per last month's data but this	608.519	3.721
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	month unfortunately adani stocks have	610.5	5.16
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	fallen by 70 70 80 also so therefore	612.24	6.12
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	people are building pressure on Sab NSC	615.66	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	BSE that you know what you should	618.36	3.479
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	probably re-look into this entire	619.62	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	redefinition of these different index	621.839	4.141
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	funds now whether they will act whether	624.18	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	they will not act this remains to be	625.98	3.539
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	seen but we need to be cognizant about	627.54	4.14
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	all the problems that this new situation	629.519	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	might present now the second key problem	631.68	3.839
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is that some index funds can become	633.36	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	really really bad and you need to	635.519	3.361
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	actually put your brain behind it and	637.2	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	understand how every Index Fund is	638.88	4.139
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	functioning and many of the beginners do	640.92	3.659
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	not understand this point so let me	643.019	3.421
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	outline it by using two examples here	644.579	5.221
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	for example consider Nifty 50. now let's	646.44	5.76
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	imagine that adani Enterprise is a part	649.8	5.039
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of nifty 50. now if adani Enterprise	652.2	5.34
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Falls in market cap or market value then	654.839	5.041
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	by next evaluation this company will go	657.54	4.739
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	out of nifty fifty and some new company	659.88	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	which has more market cap or Market	662.279	4.981
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	weight will find entry into Nifty 50. so	664.14	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	I hope this point is clear about the	667.26	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Nuance associated with the Nifty 50. so	668.88	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	nifty 50 is somewhat of a decent filter	671.1	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	but on the flip side consider for	673.44	4.8
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example Nifty next 50. now here what is	675.42	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	happening is that the company is ranked	678.24	4.86
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	between 51 to 100. now imagine if three	680.16	5.52
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies are there in nifty 50 right	683.1	5.34
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	nifty 50 they fall right and they are	685.68	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	falling they are getting crushed where	688.44	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	will they find place that some company	690.18	4.86
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is let's say at rank number 31 35 and 45	691.8	5.64
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	now they might all fall because market	695.04	4.739
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	cap is falling and they will take entry	697.44	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	into this particular index now here what	699.779	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	are you theoretically doing you are	702.18	3.3
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	actually trying to catch a falling knife	703.74	3.539
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you might have heard of this phrase in	705.48	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the stock market that don't try to catch	707.279	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	a falling knife but exactly by investing	709.5	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	in this type of an index what are you	711.959	3.601
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	precisely doing you are trying to catch	714.0	3.18
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	a Walling knife so this is what is	715.56	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	automatically happening without even you	717.18	3.659
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	realizing it now I can't take you	719.22	3.42
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	through the basics of all the index	720.839	3.721
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	funds that are out there but I have	722.64	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	drawn a charge here and you can save it	724.56	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and probably research more about it	726.54	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	where is it that adani stocks are going	728.16	4.619
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to find more value for example adani	730.38	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Wilmer is a part of nifty next 50 and	732.779	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Nifty hundred adani total gas is a part	734.94	5.339
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of nifty Sharia 25 adani power is a part	737.459	5.221
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	of 10 different indices adani Enterprise	740.279	5.521
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	is also a part of nifty hundred liquid	742.68	5.76
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	15 and you can read all these basic	745.8	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	basic points and it will actually make	748.44	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you a little bit worried when it comes	750.54	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to index investing and rightly so now	752.1	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the third final problem in terms of bad	754.32	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies finding place in indices is	756.36	4.979
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that it leads to index management now	758.64	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what is the meaning of index management	761.339	3.601
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to explain that let me take you to nifty	762.54	4.62
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	50 chart so here you can see the last	764.94	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	one year performance of nifty 50 and	767.16	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what you would notice is that it goes up	769.26	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	it goes down it goes up it goes down it	770.76	4.379
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	goes up it goes down it is going up and	772.98	4.74
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	down in a certain cycle so to say now	775.139	4.26
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what you might have noticed is that you	777.72	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	know what banks are generally going down	779.399	4.141
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	even big Banks almost all major sectors	781.38	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	are going down but Nifty tikawa so that	783.54	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	simply means that there is something	786.06	3.0
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	called as index management that is	787.2	3.12
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	happening the meaning of index	789.06	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	management is that index will dance in a	790.32	4.62
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	certain range now why is this such an	792.72	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	important point because imagine this	794.94	3.899
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that if for example adani stocks are	796.62	5.159
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	falling and index also falls from 17 000	798.839	6.12
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to let's say 15 000 or 13 000 then what	801.779	4.381
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	do you think is going to happen well	804.959	3.241
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	will covet like Market Panic can happen	806.16	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	a lot of heat will be faced by current	808.2	3.42
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	setting government a lot of problems	810.06	2.94
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	will be faced by them so Market	811.62	3.06
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	management needs to be done and there	813.0	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	are something called as market makers so	814.68	3.36
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Market maker simply means that for	816.48	3.419
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example when other people are Panic	818.04	3.84
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	selling during covert times a lot of	819.899	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	people sold everything literally then	821.88	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	someone needs to buy right so you have	823.86	3.599
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	organizations like SBI you have	825.66	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	organizations like LIC so they become	827.459	4.021
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	prominent market makers so this	829.62	3.899
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	mechanism is not bad the index actually	831.48	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	needs to be managed from time to time in	833.519	3.781
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	order to avoid Mass planning but here is	835.5	3.54
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the problem in terms of incorporating	837.3	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	bad companies into index now imagine a	839.04	4.38
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	scenario where fundamentally weak	841.62	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies are a part of nifty 50 then	843.42	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what needs to be done well then in that	845.82	4.319
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	scenario Market needs to be artificially	847.74	4.8
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	kept alive it needs to be put on a	850.139	4.861
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	ventilator and just so that Panic Neo is	852.54	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you know what Market needs to be	855.0	2.88
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	supported index management needs to be	856.26	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	done what I'm simply trying to say and I	857.88	3.06
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	hope this point did not become	859.86	3.419
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	complicated that index management is not	860.94	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	bad sometimes the market overall	863.279	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	fundamentals are such that people need	865.26	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to step in or governments need to step	867.12	3.3
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	in and manage the market nothing wrong	868.74	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	with it but if as a system your top	870.42	4.8
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	index which is nifty 50 index ends up	872.76	4.8
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	imbibing a lot of bad companies for	875.22	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	whatever reason then the market needs to	877.56	3.959
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	be artificially supported so this is the	879.72	3.479
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	precise problem that I am trying to tell	881.519	3.541
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you because what it does in the long	883.199	3.541
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	terms is that it makes the market	885.06	4.079
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	fundamentally weaker so these are three	886.74	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	specific problems that I see playing out	889.139	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	in this entire scenario and now comes	891.06	3.719
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the natural question that what is it	893.339	2.881
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that you should be doing as a stock	894.779	2.941
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	market investor you should be doing	896.22	3.119
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	index investing not doing index	897.72	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investing so here is my viewpoint on it	899.339	3.781
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	so Point number one is that if you are	901.44	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	doing index investing it is not buy and	903.12	3.959
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	forget in investing anymore because	904.92	3.719
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	right now the markets are being	907.079	3.421
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	artificially kept alive one could argue	908.639	3.781
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	definitely now when in a bull run	910.5	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	scenario what is going to happen that in	912.42	4.08
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the bull run the individual stocks are	914.22	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	going to give more run-up which are	916.5	3.48
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	fundamentally strong but bad stocks will	917.94	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	suffer more so in such circumstances the	919.98	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	chances of nifty 50 doing their dance	922.26	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	like this in a certain range becomes	924.3	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	much higher and as a Nifty or indexed	926.04	4.38
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investor you are not going to make much	928.62	3.899
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	money so this is becoming a fundamental	930.42	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	problem because fundamentally bad	932.519	3.781
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	companies are becoming a part of index	934.38	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	so this is the overarching perspective	936.3	3.479
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	that develops so this is point number	937.98	3.96
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	one so in this regard what you should	939.779	4.261
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	definitely do is that whenever you are	941.94	5.579
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investing in nifty 50 or any index have	944.04	6.06
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	a very clear exit Target now what do I	947.519	4.44
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	mean by that so this is a post that I	950.1	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	made on the member Community tab of	951.959	3.421
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	YouTube and on the wisdom hatch	953.82	4.379
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	community that hey I had purchased index	955.38	5.16
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	nifty 50 here my first clear sales	958.199	5.161
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	Target is with a gain of 5 and my second	960.54	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	clear sales Target is somewhere around 9	963.36	3.779
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	and a half percent and explain the	965.22	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	entire rationale of this move in the	967.139	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	member Community now you might agree you	968.82	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	might not agree with my viewpoint there	970.98	3.419
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	are pros and cons to it but to cut the	972.48	3.419
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	long story short whenever you are taking	974.399	4.201
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	entry into a particular index have a	975.899	4.5
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	very clear Viewpoint as to when you are	978.6	3.9
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	going to exit and why third key point	980.399	4.56
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	please avoid indices where you do not	982.5	4.44
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	know what the back end of the index is	984.959	3.841
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	for example I gave you the example of	986.94	3.78
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	sharia index you might might not	988.8	3.779
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	understand it so please go and read	990.72	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	through the methodology so this is what	992.579	3.721
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	the index methodology looks like now if	994.32	3.72
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you understand it please go and build a	996.3	4.32
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	position no doubt about that also avoid	998.04	4.68
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	investing in a bad index for example	1000.62	4.139
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	fundamentally speaking that Nifty next	1002.72	4.02
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	50 is generally not a good investment	1004.759	3.901
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	instrument for normal retail investors	1006.74	3.959
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	to chunk their money into so this is	1008.66	3.66
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	what my point of view is I've explained	1010.699	3.181
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	you the rationale earlier now if you	1012.32	3.0
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	feel otherwise definitely go and build	1013.88	3.06
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	position no doubt about it now then	1015.32	3.54
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	comes the final point that going forward	1016.94	4.259
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	if something becomes a system for	1018.86	4.2
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	example if retail investors are	1021.199	3.961
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	generally putting more money in index	1023.06	3.6
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	funds what do you think is going to	1025.16	3.419
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	happen have you seen retail investors	1026.66	3.899
zpHi6v3HcgE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpHi6v3HcgE	ever make money sustainably in any	1028.579	3.661

tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	Last July, we were just talking about
this.	0.0	1.77
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	You actually sold out of some something
your holding, citing that regulatory	1.77	3.72
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	uncertainty, given the widening
crackdown, would to some present an even	5.49	4.2
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	bigger existential threat at the moment.
What kind of forms?	9.69	3.33
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	The bull case for adding to that
position now for you?	13.08	3.18
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	Yeah.
What we're seeing is that the judicial	16.44	4.92
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	and legislative branches of our
government, you know, separation of	21.36	5.1
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	powers are starting to weigh in on this
topic.	26.46	3.49
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	And the regulator, the S.E.C., is part
of the more part of the executive branch	31.03	6.74
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	appointed by the president.
And we're as we're seeing cases go	37.88	4.0
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	through court in the judicial system.
The S.E.C., I mean, the the judicial	41.88	7.74
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	system is questioning the S.E.C.
as decisions here.	49.62	2.85
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	And so we think this is a good thing.
We actually think this is going to be in	53.16	6.63
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	the the court sent in in legislation for
perhaps years.	59.79	5.1
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	And what has happened in the meantime,
we have by now and so	67.44	2.1
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	under increasing regulatory scrutiny for
more criminal activities and fraud being	71.08	8.51
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	one of them.
And and therefore, we have the	79.59	3.42
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	competition to Coinbase, really.
We think it's disappearing.	83.01	5.07
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	And so that's a good thing longer term
for Coinbase.	88.8	2.97
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	And Kathy, you're still maintaining your
confidence across crypto more broadly.	93.21	3.27
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	Are you still confident in that one
million dollar target for bitcoins?	96.57	4.68
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	For Bitcoin?
Yes.	101.25	2.26
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	Actually, the more uncertainty and
volatility there is in the global	104.31	5.46
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	economies, the more our confidence
increases in Bitcoin.	109.77	6.45
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	And one of the reasons is we've just
been through an inflationary scare.	116.34	5.31
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	We think it was very much supply chain
driven and and and Bitcoin was is a	121.65	10.35
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	hedge against inflation.
We also believe now that the bigger risk	132.0	4.26
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	is deflation, not inflation.
And why would Bitcoin do well in that	136.26	4.8
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	circumstance?
It would do well because it's an	141.06	3.63
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	antidote to counterparty risk in the
traditional financial system.	144.69	3.49
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	On the Bitcoin block chain, everything
is transparent and maybe sue but suit	149.7	4.62
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	anonymous.
But we can see all the transactions, all	154.56	4.92
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	of the activity,
and therefore we have a much better	159.48	3.63
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	understanding of how little counterparty
risk there is in the block chain world.	163.11	4.02
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	Kathy?
So what you're saying is that you expect	168.12	2.1
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	those accusations on finance to actually
prevail if you're expecting Coinbase to	170.22	5.52
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	actually benefit from this?
And wouldn't that lead to actually more	175.74	3.27
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	regulatory crackdown on Coinbase if it's
actually become a bigger player even in	179.01	4.29
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	this industry?
It was interesting to see the S.E.C.	183.3	5.34
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	suit finance on one day and then the
next day Coinbase and they were trying	188.64	6.39
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	to put them in the same bucket.
They are not at all in the same bucket.	195.03	2.49
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	We have two former officials of finance
U.S.	198.93	3.96
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	coming forward.
And actually we now understand that they	202.9	4.64
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	have been working with regulators and
the government generally to help the	207.54	5.73
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	government understand how finance U.S.
was not separate and distinct from	213.27	6.09
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	Finance International and how much
S.E.C.	219.36	3.99
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	controlled finance U.S.
and how much of finance's data was in	223.51	8.12
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	China and how much commingling of funds
there were.	231.63	3.3
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	Coinbase is not accused of any of this.
And it is unfortunate that the S.E.C.	236.25	6.87
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	took action against Coinbase the day
after by an answer and then seemed to	243.12	3.0
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	muddy.
Chairman Gensler, as he was on one of	246.12	4.47
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	the major news channels, was trying to
implicate Coinbase in the same way that	250.59	4.95
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	he was implicating finance.
No, they're they're very different.	255.54	5.34
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	There are questions about what the
security and about staking.	263.16	3.9
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	Those are the two questions that going
bases is facing and finance is facing.	267.08	6.55
tfuAu0fGaII	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII	But most of the other questions around
finance have nothing to do with this.	275.0	4.12

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	at the moment	809.1	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the financial sector had begun to	810.72	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	stabilize but there were early signs	812.7	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that not everything would go according	815.04	3.479
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to plan	816.72	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the banking industry Fat Cats still	818.519	3.961
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	aren't lending money the big Banks	820.86	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	aren't lending despite the money the Fed	822.48	4.5

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	weren't back to lending the government's	826.98	3.12
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	not doing anything to help small	828.899	2.88
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	business and the banks are sitting on	830.1	2.76
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	their butts and they're still not	831.779	4.021
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	lending money instead they were taking a	832.86	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	lot of the money and investing it	835.8	4.86
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	themselves the banking sector is broken	837.24	5.399
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it is not lending to small business	840.66	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	somebody's got to get the money there	842.639	4.021
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the government is the actor no it's not	844.56	2.88
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	nobody	846.66	3.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you were injecting money into the banks	847.44	4.86
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	more than a trillion dollars worth at	850.44	4.199
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that point and what were the banks doing	852.3	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	with that money the fed's idea was the	854.639	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	banks would be taking that money and and	857.22	3.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	lending it effectively at lower interest	859.079	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	rates what the banks were doing instead	861.0	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	was that they were just investing in the	863.519	3.781
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	same bonds that the Fed was buying they	865.56	3.06
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	were taking that money and they were	867.3	2.82
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	turning around and buying the same	868.62	2.7
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	mortgage-backed Securities and other	870.12	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	bonds why because the FED had made very	871.32	6.12
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	clear that its goal was to drive up the	874.26	5.759
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	price of financial assets and so Wall	877.44	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Street turned around and thought why	880.019	3.421
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	would I go through the effort of making	881.82	3.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	a mortgage when I can just press a	883.44	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	button and buy you know Millions if not	885.6	5.52
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	billions dollars of bonds and and ride	888.36	5.7
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that trade as the price of those those	891.12	5.339
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	assets are very consciously being	894.06	5.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inflated by the Fed	896.459	3.141
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	grew increasingly disappointed by the	900.42	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	program and would eventually leave in	902.88	4.68
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	2011. they hadn't seen the benefits	904.86	5.099
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	accrued to the average American and I	907.56	4.079
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	wasn't seeing larger structural reform	909.959	4.021
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in favor of the average American I began	911.639	4.621
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to question whether it was my role	913.98	3.84
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	anymore to be at the Fed	916.26	3.72
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	were you seeing that the banks were	917.82	4.379
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	gaming the FED that they were in some	919.98	3.299
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	ways	922.199	3.361
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	taking advantage of this program that	923.279	5.461
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	was intended to help the real economy I	925.56	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	think you could say they were gaming the	928.74	2.94
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	fed or I think you could just say that	930.0	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	they have a different mind and they're	931.68	3.42
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	not part of the fed and they they have	933.54	3.18

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in their nature to do what's in their	941.94	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	nature and they're in their Natures to	944.1	2.88

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	quickest way possible and just because	946.98	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the FED wanted to do something and	949.68	3.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	wanted to help the the average American	951.54	3.659
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it doesn't necessarily mean that Wall	953.3	5.52

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Democratic institutions that do that not	1233.36	4.559
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the Central Bank you're basically saying	1235.46	5.16
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that because our Democratic institutions	1237.919	6.061
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	are so paralyzed and there's so much	1240.62	5.939
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	political dysfunction that we as a	1243.98	4.439
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	society we as a country have become	1246.559	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	overly reliant on the FED to run things	1248.419	6.361
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	totally economic Affairs yeah I think	1251.539	4.681
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	one of the most important things to	1254.78	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	think about is that our Democratic	1256.22	5.28
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	institutions in America are becoming	1259.28	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	less and less capable and less and less	1261.5	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	effective I think that point is almost	1263.6	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	undeniable so what we're doing in this	1265.4	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	country is we're relying on our	1268.16	3.899
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	non-democratic institutions to take up	1270.02	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the burden like the central bank and	1272.059	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economic affairs which leads you to the	1273.98	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	surreal place where we are today	1276.679	4.021
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	where this Committee of 12 people is	1278.78	4.86

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	could very well plunge our economy into	1283.64	3.419
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	a deep deep recession and cause	1285.5	3.72

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in the early days of the Easy Money	1289.22	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	experiment Fed chair Bernanke promoted	1290.96	5.04

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	effect that boosting the stock market	1296.0	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	would make people feel wealthier and	1298.1	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	start spending again there's no doubt	1300.14	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that there's quite a bit of opposition	1302.12	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	but he was met with some skepticism and	1303.62	4.74
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	concern that the decision risked causing	1306.02	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	runaway inflation	1308.36	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	he went on television to push back on	1310.34	3.719
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the critics they're looking at some of	1312.38	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the risks and uncertainties associated	1314.059	4.74
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	with doing this policy action what I	1315.86	4.799
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	think they're not doing is is looking at	1318.799	5.301
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the risk of not acting care	1320.659	3.441
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inside the FED itself Thomas honig was	1328.34	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	sounding alarms about the long-term	1330.98	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	consequences you are the one member of	1332.72	5.22
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the FED that has been critical of zero	1335.36	5.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	percent interest rates why	1337.94	4.739
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	why 10. he argued against bernanke's	1340.4	3.68
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	plan at every meeting	1342.679	4.201
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and cast The Lone dissenting vote eight	1344.08	5.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	times in a row it was difficult but this	1346.88	5.46
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	was fundamental and so I really did	1349.7	5.099
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	think that it was a wrong policy and I	1352.34	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	didn't want to be associated with it so	1354.799	4.021
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I voted no did you think it was a	1356.84	3.839
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	radical policy I most certainly did	1358.82	3.599
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	think it was a radical policy and I	1360.679	3.721
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	think most people did it was meant to be	1362.419	4.561
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	radical and so my concern was we had	1364.4	5.7
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	come through a crisis and we provided	1366.98	4.679
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the liquidity necessary to come through	1370.1	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it and we're on the other side of that	1371.659	4.561
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	crisis the economy was recovering and	1373.7	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	yet we were engaging in a deliberate	1376.22	5.1
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	effort to have easy money what were you	1378.26	5.34
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	most concerned about if Easy Money	1381.32	5.219
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	continued I thought that it was	1383.6	4.74
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	unnecessary to do I thought it brought	1386.539	3.841
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	new dangers and when you keep interest	1388.34	5.219
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	rates at zero and keep pumping money	1390.38	5.7
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	into the economy you favor the debtor	1393.559	5.521
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and you penalize the saver which you you	1396.08	4.74
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	are saving for nothing I mean you get	1399.08	3.42
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	nothing for that and if you're a	1400.82	3.839
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	borrower well life is good you borrow	1402.5	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	for nearly nothing and so you you	1404.659	5.181
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	actually encourage speculation	1406.94	6.119
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you encourage an additional risk taking	1409.84	5.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in fact that's one of the reasons they	1413.059	4.201
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	did quantitative easing was to encourage	1414.86	5.24

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the treasury market he shared with them	1546.74	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	his concerns that the markets were	1548.96	3.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	becoming dangerously addicted to the	1550.7	5.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	fed's easy money to taper or not to	1552.74	5.34
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	taper his prediction played out in 2013	1555.74	4.319
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	when after multiple rounds of	1558.08	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	quantitative easing totaling more than	1560.059	4.681
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	two trillion dollars Bernanke signaled	1562.22	4.68
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the FED might start to taper off if we	1564.74	3.72

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	confidence that that is	1568.46	3.36
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	um	1570.44	3.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	going to be sustained than we could and	1571.82	4.739
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in next few meetings we could take a	1574.22	6.36
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	step down in our pace of purchases I was	1576.559	6.301
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	on the trade flow I remember	1580.58	5.099
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	when Bernanke saying that he will taper	1582.86	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	first we had to figure out what does	1585.679	2.941
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	taper mean	1586.76	3.299
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and the minute people realized what	1588.62	3.179
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	taper meant which is that that the FED	1590.059	4.261
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	would step back from buying all these	1591.799	3.841
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Securities and even though the FED said	1594.32	2.7
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	is going to be gradual it's going to be	1595.64	2.279
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	measured	1597.02	3.18
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Demarcus had a massive tantrum the	1597.919	3.421

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the center	1603.02	3.18
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	start tapering into it shows you how	1603.919	4.801
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	addicted the markets are	1606.2	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the markets went into a fit	1608.72	4.26
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	became dysfunctional it was known as the	1611.12	4.58

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	they want candy	1620.84	3.3
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and the minute you try to take the candy	1622.279	3.0
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	away	1624.14	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	they have a tantrum you have big Wall	1625.279	4.741
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Street reaction right you have extreme	1627.74	5.039
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	volatility where Wall Street says whoa	1630.02	6.3
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	whoa no no no unacceptable and values	1632.779	4.981
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	plunge and of course the FED doesn't	1636.32	3.839
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	like that nobody likes that that's a	1637.76	5.64
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that's a precursor to instability right	1640.159	7.821
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	but it put the FED in a real bind	1643.4	4.58
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and chairman Bernanke had to go in a	1648.159	5.681
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	conference in Boston and say no no we're	1651.799	3.181
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	not tapering	1653.84	3.42
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you can only conclude that	1654.98	4.679
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	um highly accommodative monetary policy	1657.26	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	for the foreseeable future is what's	1659.659	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	needed in the U.S economy every single	1661.76	4.019
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	time the FED would start talking about	1664.279	3.541
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	okay we're going to maybe taper back	1665.779	3.361
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	faster or we're going to think about	1667.82	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	raising rates boom stocks would correct	1669.14	5.3
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	because stocks wanted that easy money	1671.72	5.18
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	dopamine hit	1674.44	5.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	bernanke's successor Janet Yellen had	1676.9	4.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	better luck the following year	1679.46	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	she was able to pause the quantitative	1681.86	4.26
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	easing part of the easy money policy	1683.9	3.72
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	without a tantrum	1686.12	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in part by suggesting she'd maintain the	1687.62	4.679
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	fed's massive balance sheet of assets it	1690.08	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	had bought and to keep short-term	1692.299	4.081
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	interest rates low	1694.1	5.16
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	MC reaffirmed its view	1696.38	5.46
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that the current zero to one quarter	1699.26	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	percent target range for the federal	1701.84	5.459
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	funds rate remains appropriate the FED	1703.88	5.52
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Justified its actions in part because	1707.299	3.841
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the fear is about runaway inflation	1709.4	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	hadn't materialized and in fact it was	1711.14	4.68
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	running below its Target of two percent	1714.02	5.1
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	because economic growth was still low	1715.82	5.76
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	but yellen's partial easy money pullback	1719.12	4.919
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	didn't dampen concerns and criticisms	1721.58	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	about the ill effects of the fed's	1724.039	3.511
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	policies	1726.08	4.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	[Music]	1727.55	3.13
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	so you're doing a documentary on the fed	1734.779	7.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and monetary policy we are trying to	1739.52	5.94
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	okay are we insane no no no I think it's	1742.159	6.181
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	a great idea okay Joseph stieglitz is	1745.46	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	one of the most well-known economists in	1748.34	4.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	America and a winner of the Nobel Prize	1750.08	5.76
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the intention of the Fed was to	1752.38	6.46
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	stimulate aggregate demand he told me	1755.84	5.4
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that while the FED had done some good he	1758.84	4.439
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	worried at the time that by stoking the	1761.24	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	stock market so aggressively it was	1763.279	4.561
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	exacerbating economic inequality	1765.26	5.82
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the main thing I was concerned about was	1767.84	7.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that the way they were trying to revive	1771.08	5.64
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the economy was a kind of trickle-down	1774.98	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Economics the way quantitative easing	1776.72	5.339
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	works is that it's a lowering of the	1779.48	6.24
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	interest rates that leagues stocks to go	1782.059	5.881
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	up and so	1785.72	6.059
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	who owns the stocks it's the people in	1787.94	6.839
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the top not just the top 10 percent one	1791.779	5.88
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	percent one-tenth of one percent and so	1794.779	6.481
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it increases enormously wealth	1797.659	6.181
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inequality we had had increasing	1801.26	4.019
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inequality	1803.84	6.059
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	really since the late 70s and this was	1805.279	7.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	putting that on steroids what sort of	1809.899	5.101
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	response did you get from Folks at the	1812.779	4.921
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	FED to what you were saying at the time	1815.0	5.279
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	our mandate is to do what we can to	1817.7	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	increase employment	1820.279	5.76
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to use the tools that we have	1822.62	6.539
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and that's what we're doing I heard a	1826.039	4.86
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	similar response when I raised these	1829.159	3.24
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	issues with the president of the	1830.899	4.561
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Minneapolis fed Neil Kashkari in March	1832.399	6.0
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	of 2021 he was the only current fed	1835.46	5.52
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	official who agreed to speak to us	1838.399	4.741
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	fed has been on a mission I've been on a	1840.98	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	mission to put Americans back to work	1843.14	3.659
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and help them get their wages up	1844.88	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	especially for those lowest income	1846.799	3.961
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Americans and if it has had some effect	1848.36	4.679
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	on Wall Street to me the trade-off is	1850.76	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	well worth it if we can put Americans	1853.039	3.541
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	back to work so that they can put food	1854.72	3.179
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	on the table they can take care of	1856.58	3.839
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	themselves that is profoundly beneficial	1857.899	4.801
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to society one of the things that we	1860.419	4.201
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	have seen in this country is a widening	1862.7	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	wealth Gap the question is what role if	1864.62	4.26
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	any of the FED has played in widening	1866.84	3.959
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that wealth Gap well this is a great	1868.88	3.779
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	point and I'm glad you raised it most	1870.799	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	people who make this argument ignore the	1872.659	4.74
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	fact that for many Americans they don't	1875.419	4.26

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	because now that interest rates are	2255.82	3.66
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	going up I still think for example we	2257.2	3.899

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that we should revamp education but it's	2261.099	4.76

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	going forward and I think the FED had	2357.82	4.08

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	knew what it was doing	2410.339	4.961

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the fed's decision to raise interest	2423.7	3.36

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the exact opposite	2430.359	4.861
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Powell would change course	2432.7	5.159
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the Federal Reserve cut a key short-term	2435.22	5.16

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	recently as December you see this	2440.38	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	complete reversal and what a lot of	2442.66	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	investors and economists saw as a	2444.88	4.44

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	financial markets don't like this so the	2449.32	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	fed's going to reverse course	2451.72	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and that has defined chair Powell ever	2453.46	5.159
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	since then a tricky Balancing Act for	2456.22	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	chairman Powell he'll now face criticism	2458.619	4.081
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that the FED has bowed to pressure from	2460.54	4.579

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	sort of 20 percent and went from	2473.079	4.741
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	tightening policy to easing policy and	2475.24	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it became very clear to the market that	2477.82	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	saving the stock market was now one of	2479.74	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the FED mandates and I think that had	2481.96	4.74
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	really ominous ramifications for the	2483.82	3.4

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	consequence to the economy was how the	2597.22	3.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	fed's low interest rates had been	2599.56	3.84
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	incentivizing public companies to take	2601.0	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	on more and more debt valuations are	2603.4	5.04

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	debt we have flagged the rise in	2608.44	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	corporate debt we have entirely too much	2610.72	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	corporate debt out there and now I saw	2612.76	4.559
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	numerous studies and reports detailing	2615.16	4.439
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the extent of the debt and how even	2617.319	4.381
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Marquee companies were becoming so	2619.599	5.461
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	leveraged their credit ratings plummeted	2621.7	5.399
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the FED had hoped that companies would	2625.06	3.779
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	put all that borrowed money to good use	2627.099	3.961
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and invest in their Workforce and their	2628.839	4.74
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	infrastructure but in reality it played	2631.06	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	out differently the BuyBacks find back	2633.579	4.621

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	robbing the American worker and	2638.2	3.84
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	companies were often borrowing money to	2639.94	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	buy back their own stock making the	2642.04	4.74
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	remaining shares more valuable and the	2644.38	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	price is higher as a corporation you	2646.78	4.319
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	realize all that matters is the stock	2649.18	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	price so what do we have to do to	2651.099	4.921
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	increase the stock price and more often	2653.74	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that is buying back the stock	2656.02	4.319
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	so it used to be the FED would lower	2658.18	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	interest rates businesses would then	2660.339	4.081
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	take on more debt they would use that	2662.56	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	debt to hire more workers build more	2664.42	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	machines and more factories now what	2666.7	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	happens is the Federal Reserve lowers	2668.98	4.619
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	interest rates businesses use that to go	2670.72	4.859
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	out and borrow more money but they use	2673.599	4.681
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that money to buy back stock and invest	2675.579	4.441
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in technology that will eliminate	2678.28	4.079
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	workers and reduce employee headcounts	2680.02	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	they use that money to give the CEO and	2682.359	6.061
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	other corporate officers big bonuses and	2684.94	6.179
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	then eventually issue more debt and buy	2688.42	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	back more stock so it's this endless	2691.119	4.561
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	cycle of things that are designed to	2693.4	5.419
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	increase the stock price rather than	2695.68	6.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	improve the actual company okay GE just	2698.819	6.821
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	authorized a 50 billion dollar stock	2702.46	5.76
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	buyback the numbers were astounding more	2705.64	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	than six trillion dollars in corporate	2708.22	3.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	BuyBacks during this easy money decade	2709.96	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	after the financial crisis 50 billion	2712.0	5.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	dollar stock buyback that makes a big	2714.88	3.979
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	deal big difference to the stock price	2717.04	5.039
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	BuyBacks were an embarrassment and so	2718.859	6.22
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it's just another example of things that	2722.079	4.561
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	used to be viewed as kind of ooh you	2725.079	4.321

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the time that the Fed was incentivizing	2733.96	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	bad behavior on Wall Street despite its	2736.24	4.92

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	so much because these interest rate this	2741.16	3.72

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	of blood sucker on the economy is that	2878.14	4.199
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	is that what you're saying yes	2880.839	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	collectively we fulfill a completely	2882.339	5.641
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	necessary service but what we have done	2885.339	5.341
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	is created Lads upon layers of more and	2887.98	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	more convoluted expensive financial	2890.68	4.26
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	instruments and that's what makes all	2892.48	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the profits for the financial industry	2894.94	5.159
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and it's it's taken a lot of Ingenuity	2897.28	6.24
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and salesmanship to make this happen and	2900.099	6.0
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	a lot of lobbying in Congress etc etc	2903.52	5.099
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and we have imposed	2906.099	5.041
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	on the rest of the economy the idea that	2908.619	5.601
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Banking and finance are utterly	2911.14	6.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	important at all times if if you do	2914.22	6.28
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	anything wrong to us the entire economy	2917.68	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	will collapse in ragged disarray	2920.5	4.2

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	corporate debt how is that viewed by you	2924.7	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and others at the FED something we pay a	2927.22	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	lot of attention to but when companies	2929.14	3.179
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	are buying back their stock one of the	2930.76	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	things they're telling us is we don't	2932.319	4.141
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	have profitable places to invest and	2934.24	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it's easier for us just to buy back our	2936.46	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	stock that's concerning in terms of the	2938.14	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	future of our economy but that's not	2940.96	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	because of the Fed so we pay attention	2942.76	4.079
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to it it really matters but I in my view	2944.56	3.86
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we don't it's not something we control	2946.839	3.721
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Kashkari and others have pointed out	2948.42	3.88
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that it's the job of Congress and	2950.56	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Regulators to address some of these	2952.3	4.2
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	concerning Trends and when we sat down	2954.16	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in 2021 he was quick to dispute the	2956.5	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	criticism that the fed's policies had	2959.14	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	really just been boosting financial	2961.3	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	markets and helping Wall Street we hear	2962.68	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it all the time from Wall Street people	2965.74	5.16
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that they basically that prices are are	2967.48	6.3
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	of that are completely untethered from	2970.9	5.52
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	some fundamental reality there is this	2973.78	5.28
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	idea on Wall Street that the FED kind of	2976.42	5.52
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	has our back and that because you may	2979.06	4.799
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	have well-intentioned policies that are	2981.94	3.84
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	trying to get everybody to work	2983.859	4.621
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	there is this side effect this	2985.78	5.579
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	unintended side effect of just kind of	2988.48	6.3
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	really um helping the rich that argument	2991.359	5.821
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	ignores the benefit to the poor and if	2994.78	3.299
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you're sure if you're going to ignore	2997.18	2.58
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the benefit to the poor then we're only	2998.079	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	helping the rich but of course that's an	2999.76	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	incomplete analysis when you actually	3001.619	3.72
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	sit down and say well let's go through	3003.9	3.66
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the trade-offs of the choices that the	3005.339	4.201
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	FED has whether it's interest rates or	3007.56	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it's quantitative easing it's not just	3009.54	3.66
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	about Wall Street it's not just about	3011.64	3.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	asset prices it's also about thinking	3013.2	4.2
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	about the men and women in America who	3015.42	3.72
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	are trying to find work and who want to	3017.4	3.36
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	have higher earnings and who deserve	3019.14	3.66
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	higher earnings if we are benefiting	3020.76	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	them by helping them find work and	3022.8	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	helping them have higher wages I will	3024.78	4.76
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	take that trade-off	3026.76	2.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	beyond the debate over the effects on	3034.319	3.901
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Main Street there were increasing	3036.42	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	concerns about the risks on Wall Street	3038.22	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	what would happen to all those companies	3040.74	4.079
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that had gone deep into debt and their	3042.72	4.81
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	investors if there was a downturn	3044.819	4.441

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	some of the most dire warnings were	3049.26	4.079
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	about a largely unregulated sector of	3051.18	4.26
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the financial world that had become a	3053.339	4.141
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	key player in all the borrowing going on	3055.44	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	finance was getting bigger and bigger	3057.48	4.379
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and riskier and riskier and then there	3059.46	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	was something else going on that was	3061.859	5.281
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	only noticed later on the risk had	3064.44	5.1
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	migrated to what we call the non-banks	3067.14	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	so the financial system that are not	3069.54	5.12
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Banks and it had morphed it had changed	3071.28	7.079
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and in doing so the ability to	3074.66	6.159
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	understand what was going on came down	3078.359	5.22
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	because the non-banks are not supervised	3080.819	5.401
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and regulated as well as the banks	3083.579	4.681
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the phrase that was used at the time was	3086.22	3.72

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that there were banking activities	3089.94	3.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	happening but they were happening in the	3091.619	3.121

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in the shadows of the banks themselves	3094.74	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	these are the asset management companies	3096.48	4.32

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	systemically important when it comes to	3103.38	5.459

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the Fed	4528.08	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it kind of was Mania at the time the Fed	4528.98	5.1

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	liquidity with with with with money did	4534.08	4.68
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you not see all of that Mania as a sign	4536.659	4.441
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	of overheating that an indicator in the	4538.76	4.28

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	financial markets not infrequently there	4548.6	4.139
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	have been other times we've seen booms	4551.06	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in financial markets if we are going to	4552.739	4.341
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	try to raise interest rates to control	4554.96	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	excitement in the stock market	4557.08	4.36
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the car who's going to bear the cost of	4559.52	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that the people who are out of work	4561.44	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	today if we had said let's go raise	4563.06	4.619
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	interest rates to try to keep crypto	4565.34	5.58
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	down keep Bitcoin from going too high	4567.679	4.681
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and we're going to keep millions of	4570.92	2.94
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Americans out of work as the way to do	4572.36	5.06
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that that strikes me as a bad trade	4573.86	6.749
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	[Music]	4577.42	3.189
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I think interest rates and inflation are	4584.06	5.82
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	going to rise well above what the FED	4587.239	5.221
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	has projected as the markets were	4589.88	4.799
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	heating up so we're concerned that the	4592.46	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	fed's policies would fuel inflation	4594.679	4.801

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we have faced in the last 40 years	4632.239	5.221
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	critics like former treasury secretary	4635.3	4.74
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Larry Summers were publicly expressing	4637.46	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	concern that all the stimulus money from	4640.04	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the fed and the government would boost	4642.08	4.079
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economic demand at a time when Supply	4644.06	4.38

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	order of magnitude greater than the one	4657.14	5.28
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we had after the global financial crisis	4659.78	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	would lead to excessive demand	4662.42	5.299
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	overheating and inflation	4664.28	7.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	an unprecedented fiscal stimulus an	4667.719	6.221

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	be more selective there really just was	4682.219	3.841
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	all this money being pushed out in the	4684.5	3.719

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the highest inflation in more than a	4732.62	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	decade transitory transitory transitory	4734.239	3.901
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	transitory now I know you believe this	4736.64	2.94
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	is transitory but everything's	4738.14	3.599
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	transitory life is transitory this	4739.58	5.099
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inflation round is not transitory this	4741.739	5.821
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	is a very hot inflation environment and	4744.679	5.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the longer the central banks wait	4747.56	5.159
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the greater the risk I reacted quite	4749.719	5.281
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	strongly to the assertion that inflation	4752.719	3.841
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	was going to be transitory	4755.0	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I remember warning at that time that we	4756.56	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	simply don't have enough evidence	4758.96	3.68
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that it is going to be transitory	4761.06	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	transitory is a very reassuring term	4762.64	4.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	because I tell you don't worry about it	4765.5	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it is temporary it is reversible	4767.54	3.72
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	therefore we don't need to change	4769.82	3.72
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Behavior so yes we have inflation but	4771.26	4.26
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	don't worry what kind of evidence were	4773.54	4.199
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you seeing this may be stickier	4775.52	5.46
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inflation than it is transitory one what	4777.739	5.341
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	companies were telling us	4780.98	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and companies were saying I am not so	4783.08	3.72
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	extransitory	4785.48	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	this is beyond the pandemic I was	4786.8	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	talking to CEOs	4789.02	4.139
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and they were giving me a very clear	4790.82	5.46
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	message the same message that was in one	4793.159	6.241
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	earning call after another earning call	4796.28	5.939
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	they did not view the disruptions as	4799.4	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	being transitory	4802.219	3.841
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	why transitory why that word what did	4803.78	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you think at the time well we saw a	4806.06	3.3
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	number of factors that we thought were	4807.8	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	conspiring to lead to high prices and	4809.36	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that many of those factors would Fade	4811.28	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Away over time so for example Supply	4812.84	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	chains we saw were getting gummed up but	4815.36	3.72
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we also know that businesses were	4817.46	4.88
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	working very hard to ungum those up to	4819.08	5.639
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	untangle those Supply chains so we	4822.34	3.7
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	thought that they'd probably make more	4824.719	3.0
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	progress there than we expected The	4826.04	3.3
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Business Roundtable for instance was	4827.719	3.721
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	coming out and saying polling their CEOs	4829.34	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and saying look we're seeing inflation	4831.44	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	everywhere and what we're doing okay	4833.84	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	how does something like that land for	4836.0	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you at that time I mean I take it	4838.46	4.199
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	seriously I don't dismiss it then I I	4840.32	3.66
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	map it against the data that we're	4842.659	3.06
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	seeing okay but I'll just say if we did	4843.98	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	not have an outlier view on inflation or	4845.719	5.281
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the economy overall if you look at the	4848.96	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	consensus of forecasts among experts in	4851.0	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	America on Wall Street around the world	4853.28	4.2
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	they all basically had the same forecast	4855.44	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	which is inflation is going to be	4857.48	3.179
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	transitory it's going to come back down	4858.92	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	yes there were outliers but if you look	4860.659	4.861
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	at the consensus we were well within the	4862.52	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	consensus of the experts who study this	4865.52	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	any regret about not taking the foot off	4867.32	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the pedal seeing what for instance the	4869.9	3.299
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	federal government was doing at that	4871.76	3.18
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	point in time well I think again knowing	4873.199	3.601
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	what I know now absolutely	4874.94	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I put the same questions to Brian deese	4876.8	4.859
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	one of the chief architects of the Biden	4879.5	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	administration's 1.9 trillion dollar	4881.659	5.101
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	rescue plan were the inflation concerns	4883.88	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	at the time part of your internal	4886.76	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	deliberation about doing the the rescue	4888.26	4.88
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	act it was an issue that we were always	4890.9	5.88
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	aware of and focused on and weighing in	4893.14	5.2
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the in the you know the weighing and	4896.78	2.879
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	balancing that you have to make when you	4898.34	4.2
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	do policy making uh in in the face of	4899.659	5.161
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	uncertainty you're saying that you knew	4902.54	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that that could be a potential trade-off	4904.82	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it was always a trade-off it was always	4906.92	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	a trade-off and the logic behind our	4908.84	4.26
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	actions was to get ahead of the pandemic	4910.82	4.919
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	help bridge for families and businesses	4913.1	4.74
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and also ensure against the downside	4915.739	4.621
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	risks to our economy and I think if we	4917.84	5.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	look back now and recognize that the	4920.36	4.68
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inflation challenge that the U.S economy	4922.88	4.799
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	faces is not unique it is a global	4925.04	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	challenge inflation is higher in the in	4927.679	4.381
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Europe in the UK today than it is in the	4929.84	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	United States was there a concern at the	4932.06	4.26
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	White House that the Fed was running the	4934.28	5.22
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economy too hot for too long	4936.32	4.859
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that is a question that I will	4939.5	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	institutionally not answer why	4941.179	5.641
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	because one of the Hallmarks of our	4943.88	5.46
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	system is the independence of monetary	4946.82	4.919
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	policy making this has been something	4949.34	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that you can't take for granted in our	4951.739	4.561
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	system that prior presidents have not	4953.3	5.22
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	necessarily honored but this present	4956.3	3.72
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	this Administration is quite committed	4958.52	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to the proposition that the strength of	4960.02	3.659
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	our system one of the strengths of the	4962.12	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	US economy is the trust that people have	4963.679	4.681
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in the independence of our monetary	4966.02	6.659
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Authority and therefore we are make	4968.36	6.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	deliberate choices to not make comments	4972.679	4.321
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	on questions like that	4975.32	3.359
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we're gonna begin tonight with the rough	4977.0	4.02

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to many it carries a time a sense of uh	5343.84	8.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	of short-lived we we tend to to to use	5347.08	6.42
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it to mean that it won't leave a	5351.88	3.779

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inflation I think it's it's probably a	5355.659	4.381
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	good time to retire that that word and	5357.88	3.74

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	issues in particular well one of the	5489.219	4.321
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	reasons prices are high is because	5491.38	3.779
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	there's too much demand in the economy	5493.54	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and by raising interest rates for	5495.159	4.801
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	example we are going to slow down demand	5497.62	4.019
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	for housing people going out and buying	5499.96	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	up homes which eventually should prevent	5501.639	5.401
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	home prices and rents from continuing to	5504.28	5.16
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	climb that should benefit workers but	5507.04	4.679
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	things like gas prices that's not being	5509.44	3.84
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	driven by us I mean that's being driven	5511.719	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	by the war Russia invading Ukraine Saudi	5513.28	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Arabia cutting back production big	5516.159	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	geopolitical forces so there's some	5518.08	3.659
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	pieces of this that we can directly	5520.239	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	affect some pieces of this are out of	5521.739	4.021
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	our control I mean some people have said	5523.719	4.081
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you're kind of the interest rates are	5525.76	4.979
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	almost like a or a sledgehammer it's not	5527.8	4.339
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	like a scalpel	5530.739	3.721
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	can these problems be solved with a	5532.139	3.941
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	scalpel or you really do believe that	5534.46	3.06
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you need to bring the hammer down to	5536.08	4.139
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	some extent well here's the thing I	5537.52	4.199
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	would love to be able to bring it with a	5540.219	4.681
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	scalpel and a year ago I argued that I	5541.719	4.621
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	thought many of these factors were	5544.9	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	transitory meaning you've got these	5546.34	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	one-time events they're going to pass	5548.44	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and then inflation will come down so	5550.3	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	let's not bring out the hammer that was	5551.98	4.259
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	my view that didn't happen	5553.84	4.319
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	so now we have to bring the hammer	5556.239	3.601
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	because if we don't bring the hammer	5558.159	3.901
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	this thing can get out of control so to	5559.84	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	those who point to the fed and say you	5562.06	4.619
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	ran it too hot for too long and that was	5564.46	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	an epic mistake you say what I said Look	5566.679	4.621
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Around the World other central banks	5569.38	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	adjusted more quickly than we did to	5571.3	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	their credit and unfortunately their	5573.52	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economies are facing very similar	5575.44	3.779
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inflation and so yes with the benefit of	5577.06	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	hindsight I wish we had tightened sooner	5579.219	4.261
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	but I'm not kidding myself to think it	5581.38	3.18
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	would have made a big difference in	5583.48	4.219
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	where we are in inflation today	5584.56	3.139
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	a month after Jackson Hole I caught up	5590.02	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	with business reporter Chris Leonard as	5592.54	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the Fed was announcing another rate hike	5594.82	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	moving at the fastest Pace in 40 years	5596.56	5.84
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	good afternoon	5599.38	3.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you raised its policy interest rate by	5603.34	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	three quarters of a percentage point it	5605.38	3.18
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	can be a little bit hard to understand	5607.36	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	because you hear okay the FED hiked	5608.56	3.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	rates today to three and a half percent	5610.96	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	what does that mean that my credit card	5612.34	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	rate is going to be a little bit higher	5614.44	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	or I'll have to borrow more money for a	5616.3	4.379
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	house he is talking about a fundamental	5618.4	4.259
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	restructuring of the financial system	5620.679	5.52
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the the financial system globally has	5622.659	6.661
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	been built around extremely low ultra	5626.199	5.221
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	low interest rates for 10 years my	5629.32	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	colleagues and I are strongly committed	5631.42	3.719
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to Bringing inflation back down to our	5633.28	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	two percent goal I think people don't	5635.139	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	appreciate the magnitude of what the FED	5637.3	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	did over the last decade and so this is	5639.699	3.841
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	going to be like a long-term thing	5642.1	3.66
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	playing out over time probably over like	5643.54	5.159
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	a year or two of	5645.76	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	shifting to a higher rate environment	5648.699	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and then the correction that that's	5650.56	5.159
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	going to cause so he's talking about a	5652.179	5.221
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	huge adjustment that's not going to be	5655.719	3.541
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	an adjustment upward things aren't going	5657.4	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to get easier things are going to get	5659.26	2.53
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	harder	5661.3	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	[Music]	5661.79	5.69
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	are blaring the Specter of this kind of	5664.78	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economic upheaval has heightened	5667.48	2.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	concerns about a recession	5669.34	4.22
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	[Music]	5670.44	3.12
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the jobless rate unemployment goes up	5676.84	4.859
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	good evening	5679.6	4.68
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	are we gonna let this Corporation stop	5681.699	6.061
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	workers from joining a union	5684.28	5.879
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it's also raised fears of layoffs which	5687.76	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	has aggravated the organized labor	5690.159	4.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	movement	5691.84	2.359
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Liz Schuler leads the largest labor	5696.58	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	organization in the country and has been	5698.5	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	urging the FED to slow down listen to	5700.54	5.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	your workers	5702.82	3.2
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we met with chairman Powell and sixth	5707.739	4.801
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Board of Governors	5711.1	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	um because I think the FED doesn't often	5712.54	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	get to hear from actual working people	5715.0	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and and how they're seeing things in the	5717.34	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economy what was your message for the	5719.62	3.42
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	FED when they started to raise rates	5721.42	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that raising the interest rates is bad	5723.04	5.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	for working people that we think it puts	5726.34	6.06
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the trajectory that we're on at risk in	5729.0	5.679
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	terms of coming out of this pandemic we	5732.4	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	know that we're in a consumer-driven	5734.679	5.341
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economy right and if working people are	5737.02	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	not able to make ends meet they're not	5740.02	4.26
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	going to be buying goods and it's going	5741.82	5.16
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to grind the economy to a halt we can't	5744.28	5.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	take aggressive moves that are going to	5746.98	4.679
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	throw people out of work and basically	5749.32	4.859
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	balance the economy on the backs of	5751.659	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	working people but I mean the FED is	5754.179	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	tasked with controlling inflation and	5756.159	4.441
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and inflation is definitely bad for	5758.199	5.701
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	working people so why advocate for the	5760.6	6.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	FED to take its foot off the pedal	5763.9	6.36
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	well because the interest rate hikes	5767.08	5.099
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	they were implementing were happening	5770.26	4.379
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	quickly and we thought it was happening	5772.179	4.681
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	too fast	5774.639	3.961
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	um and also though	5776.86	4.26
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	their tools aren't necessarily going to	5778.6	5.34
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	impact the things like gas prices and	5781.12	5.7
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	food prices which is what most working	5783.94	5.4
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	people are worried about the FED doesn't	5786.82	5.16
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	ever want to say this out loud but their	5789.34	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	goal is quite literally to make	5791.98	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	businesses not want to hire people or to	5793.9	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	get businesses actually to lay people	5796.54	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	off the FED is estimated that the	5798.4	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	unemployment rate under their very Rosy	5800.56	4.74
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	projections uh by the end of this year	5803.02	4.159
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	would rise to four and a half percent	5805.3	5.28
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	there is no real way for unemployment to	5807.179	4.601
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	get from three and a half percent to	5810.58	3.119
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	four and a half percent without millions	5811.78	3.66
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	of people losing their jobs	5813.699	3.781
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I understand the kind of the best case	5815.44	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	scenario being that you bring down	5817.48	4.94
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inflation without unemployment going up	5819.76	5.78
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and that somehow we avoid a recession	5822.42	6.94
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	but if employment does stay strong and	5825.54	6.82
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inflation stays High then don't you have	5829.36	5.879
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to basically hurt the jobs Market I mean	5832.36	4.799
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	isn't that the bottom line here we do	5835.239	3.061
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	have to we are going to have to keep	5837.159	2.761
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	raising rates until we get inflation	5838.3	4.2
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	back down that is absolutely true and	5839.92	3.9
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	one of the	5842.5	3.659
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	sources of optimism and it's you know	5843.82	5.46
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it's mild optimism is when there have	5846.159	4.681
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	been recessions that have been caused by	5849.28	3.18
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the Central Bank raising interest rates	5850.84	4.799
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the good news is once inflation is in	5852.46	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	check and they reverse their policies	5855.639	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the bounce back can be very quick so	5856.96	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we're not trying to engineer a recession	5859.179	4.261
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	but if one were to happen I feel pretty	5860.56	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	confident that we could have a very fast	5863.44	2.759
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	recovery	5865.06	3.659

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	there's a famous line by investor Warren	6060.84	3.96
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Buffett you know you don't find out	6063.239	3.0
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	who's been	6064.8	3.839
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	swimming naked until the tide goes out	6066.239	5.581
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and almost everyone I spoke to repeated	6068.639	4.861
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that line to describe what's been	6071.82	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	happening when interest rates start to	6073.5	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	rise and the tide pulls out as Warren	6075.36	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Buffett would say you don't know who's	6078.48	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	swimming naked until the tide goes out	6080.28	3.899
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you see who's swimming without a bathing	6082.56	4.139
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	suit when they tied these receding we'll	6084.179	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	find out who's wearing their swimsuits	6086.699	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	When the tide goes out what's amazing is	6088.679	4.861
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that a lot of people and I would say I'm	6091.139	3.661
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	included in this think that there	6093.54	2.46
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	probably will be a bigger correction at	6094.8	2.939
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	some point but look when you when you	6096.0	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	say you expect there to be a bigger	6097.739	4.321
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	correction what does that actually mean	6100.38	3.0
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I mean a lot of people are going to see	6102.06	3.42
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	this and get concerned about that	6103.38	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	obviously yeah yeah let me let me try	6105.48	5.84
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and be honest but not scare people	6107.94	5.88
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	yeah that's possible	6111.32	5.859
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	so the markets were down 20 percent last	6113.82	4.379
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	year	6117.179	4.741
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that seems like a lot and if we were in	6118.199	5.221
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	a normal	6121.92	5.16
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Market cycle I'd say okay we're done you	6123.42	5.819
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	know we're probably at the bottom	6127.08	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I don't know if I can safely say that	6129.239	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we're at the bottom because of what	6132.06	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we're looking back at this age of easy	6134.219	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	money not just even since the financial	6136.56	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	crisis but before that you know for the	6139.139	4.261
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	decades that rates have been going down	6141.48	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and down and down and debt has been	6143.4	3.299
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	going up and up and up	6144.96	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that's a long period of time where	6146.699	5.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	assets have arguably been artificially	6149.04	5.46
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	inflated and so is it possible that you	6151.739	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	could see a continued correction at some	6154.5	5.699
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	point it is possible now I'm personally	6156.719	5.101
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	not going out and selling my entire	6160.199	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	stock portfolio I don't want to scare	6161.82	5.22
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	people but I do want to say that I think	6163.679	6.361
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we are in a once in a lifetime Financial	6167.04	5.159
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	transition and I think that everybody	6170.04	5.28
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	needs to sort of strap in for that and	6172.199	5.281
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	if you need your money in the next	6175.32	5.22
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	couple of years I would be more cautious	6177.48	5.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	than not	6180.54	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	in these early months of 2023 on Wall	6182.52	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Street some have been betting that the	6185.34	4.2
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	FED will relent stop raising interest	6187.44	4.86
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	rates as inflation cools down	6189.54	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	because the higher it pushes rates and	6192.3	4.379
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the longer it does the greater the risks	6194.46	4.679
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and so the marketplace is saying the FED	6196.679	4.381
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	is going to go too far and it's going to	6199.139	4.261
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	be forced to reverse course	6201.06	5.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that is really unusual we've got to a	6203.4	5.759
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	situation now where the markets	6206.1	4.86
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	dismissed what the FED is telling us	6209.159	4.801
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it's a moment where there are many more	6210.96	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	potential outcomes	6213.96	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	some are fine a soft Landing some are	6215.46	6.0
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	not are hard landing and the truth is	6218.76	6.06
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you cannot distinguish enough between	6221.46	5.64
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	them one of the most pessimistic voices	6224.82	5.28

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and so the FED is absolutely right to	6372.119	4.141
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	try and get it under control by raising	6374.1	4.44

EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	costs rise are you basically saying that	6393.84	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we should be preparing right now that	6395.82	3.419
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	there would be	6397.86	3.299
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you know a bursting of this massive	6399.239	3.42
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	credit bubble	6401.159	3.721
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it's happening right in front of us	6402.659	5.241
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you know it may	6404.88	3.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it's happening right now are you usually	6408.9	4.319
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	this Gloomy or am I just getting you on	6411.42	4.92
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	a bad day you got me on a bad day	6413.219	5.821
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	one of the concerns is that there's a	6416.34	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	kind of debt bomb out there both in the	6419.04	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	American economy as well as the global	6420.84	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economy How concerned are you about a	6422.52	5.76
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	credit bubble popping we're looking at	6425.46	4.679
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the the data we're not seeing evidence	6428.28	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	of such a popping we're not seeing	6430.139	4.321
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	evidence of delinquencies taking off it	6431.76	4.439
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	might happen in the future it might but	6434.46	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I'm not seeing evidence of it households	6436.199	3.301
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	on average have very strong balance	6438.06	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	sheets the big Banks which can be very	6439.5	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	risky for the economy are well	6441.6	3.84
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	capitalized relative to where they were	6443.82	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	before 2008 so we're not seeing evidence	6445.44	5.46
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	of it yet you know can't rule it out so	6447.9	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I guess the question though is how much	6450.9	3.36
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	disruption in the financial markets are	6452.46	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you willing to tolerate now that they're	6454.26	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	adjusting to this new interest rate	6456.96	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	environment after more than a decade of	6458.76	5.52
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	of zero rates we live in a market	6461.76	5.399
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economy and Market participants need to	6464.28	4.68
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	find a way to adjust to a changing	6467.159	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economic landscape it's not the fed's	6468.96	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	job to bail out Wall Street investors if	6470.639	5.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	their stock portfolios go down obviously	6473.28	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we need to keep systemic risk from	6475.679	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	spilling across the whole economy and	6477.36	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	when those events happen we are prepared	6479.219	4.561
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to act but from in my view the bar of us	6481.38	4.68
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	act the bar from us acting should be	6483.78	3.419
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	quite High	6486.06	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I mean the FED has come to the rescue	6487.199	4.02
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	several times and we've talked about	6489.54	3.24
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	this in the past of the financial	6491.219	4.621
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	markets that had grown vulnerable and	6492.78	5.7
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	brittle so are you saying I'm just again	6495.84	4.859
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I'm asking what what degree of	6498.48	3.84
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	disruption would you have to see in	6500.699	3.48
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	order for the FED to intervene you know	6502.32	3.899
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it's uh we're a long long way away from	6504.179	4.081
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	that I guess I would say it that way	6506.219	4.321
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we are a long long way for any kind of	6508.26	3.6
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	disruption that would warrant us	6510.54	4.079
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	stepping in that way	6511.86	4.62
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	less than five months after that	6514.619	4.201
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	interview the FED would indeed have to	6516.48	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	step in in breaking news the U.S federal	6518.82	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	reserve has bowed out the Silicon Valley	6520.86	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Bank which had collapsed over the	6523.26	4.8
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	weekend it enacted emergency measures to	6525.36	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	shore up the banking system after two	6528.06	4.619
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Banks collapsed this is the biggest bank	6530.34	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	collapsed since the 2008 financial	6532.679	4.261
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	crisis there are important questions of	6534.84	3.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	how these Banks got into the	6536.94	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	circumstance in the first place	6538.38	5.16
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	ability in the system related to	6541.32	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	monetary policy if we hadn't been	6543.54	4.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	driving our economy for 14 years with	6545.82	3.839
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Easy Money And then trying to really	6547.86	3.72
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	quickly undo that no we wouldn't be	6549.659	4.621
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	having these problems now absolutely not	6551.58	5.7
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	what should the FED do so uh for a long	6554.28	5.28
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	time I've advocated that the FED should	6557.28	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	be raising rates but even I believe now	6559.56	4.38
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	they need to hit pause they've gone too	6561.84	4.08
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	far too fast I need to hit pause and	6563.94	3.719
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	assess the impact on the financial	6565.92	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	system and the economy	6567.659	4.621
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	it's unclear what the FED will do next	6570.06	4.679
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	but just days before the bank failures	6572.28	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Jerome Powell appeared before Congress	6574.739	4.621
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to answer tough questions about the	6577.26	3.24
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economy	6579.36	3.359
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and we actually don't think that we need	6580.5	5.4
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to see a sharp or enormous increase in	6582.719	4.561
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	unemployment to get inflation under	6585.9	3.06
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	control I'm looking at your	6587.28	4.68
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	shins do you call two	6588.96	5.12
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	you're not a sharp increase	6591.96	4.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	the hearing was a Showcase of partisan	6594.08	5.32
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	politics and government gridlock raising	6596.94	4.199
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	interest rates won't stop Senate	6599.4	4.14
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	Democrats and President Biden from over	6601.139	5.161
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	taxing overspending and it was yet	6603.54	5.04
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	another reminder of how in an era of	6606.3	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	political dysfunction we've become so	6608.58	4.619
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	dependent on the fed and on easy money	6610.8	5.28
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	to drive the American economy the	6613.199	5.161
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	economy needs to get back into balance	6616.08	5.52
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	and that will be painful and if we keep	6618.36	5.879
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	putting off the Day of Reckoning we'll	6621.6	4.5
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	just make the Day of Reckoning a bigger	6624.239	3.661
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	day of reckon how do you think we'll	6626.1	3.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	look back at this era of easy money	6627.9	4.44
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	unfortunately I think we may look back	6630.08	4.059
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	on it as something of a golden era	6632.34	4.56
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	because you know cheap and free money	6634.139	7.321
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	without consequences is great but in	6636.9	8.16
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	other ways we will think about it as a	6641.46	6.54
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	lesson for the future which is that it	6645.06	5.599
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	was a mistake	6648.0	2.659
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	I think that we're going to look back on	6653.82	3.98
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	this era	6656.58	4.139
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	as being totally exceptional	6657.8	5.439
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	historically and one where we didn't	6660.719	4.381
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	fulfill its potential	6663.239	5.281
EpMLAQbSYAw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw	we lost sight of something critical we	6665.1	7.079

LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	video let me cover some really important	1.979	3.481
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	points because these type of points will	3.78	3.3
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	get missed Point number one is that this	5.46	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	video is not a personal attack on adani	7.08	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	group or adani ji all that stuff I'm a	9.0	4.259
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	basic retail investor and I am giving	11.16	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	out information for retail investors	13.259	3.661
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Point number two a very important Point	14.88	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	here is that there is a lot of panic	16.92	3.24
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that is going on that adani stocks are	18.42	3.24
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	going to go to zero there's some	20.16	3.24
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	fundamental issue going now see this	21.66	3.3
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	might or might not happen but the	23.4	2.76
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	fundamentals you should know so	24.96	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	basically for a stock to fall to like	26.16	4.859
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and get absolutely demolished what needs	28.56	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	to happen is that the positions need to	31.019	4.141
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	get cut in the cash market so cash	33.0	3.36
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Market means that you are taking	35.16	3.239
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	delivery and then selling the stocks so	36.36	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	someone needs to own such high volumes	38.399	4.201
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	of adani stocks and they need to sell it	40.44	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	after looking at all the Panic that is	42.6	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	going on so now the Hindenburg report	44.52	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that has come out so Hindenburg is	46.32	3.3
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	shorting the stock this is something	48.12	3.06
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that I have explained extensively on the	49.62	3.0
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	main video so please watch it you will	51.18	3.059
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	understand what that means but to cut	52.62	3.3
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the long story short what is basically	54.239	3.901
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	happening is that for a stock to fall	55.92	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	significantly someone needs to to cut	58.14	4.739
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	position in the cash market right now	60.42	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the allegations are that you know what	62.879	3.661
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that adaniji and his allies are	64.5	4.14
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	controlling most of the adani stocks so	66.54	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	who is going to sell that's the key	68.64	3.299
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	question so couple of points come here	70.14	3.299
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that you know what maybe Banks could	71.939	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	sell because a lot of pledge promoter	73.439	4.381
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	holding is with the bank but if banks do	75.659	3.421
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	it then they themselves are shooting	77.82	2.7
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	themselves in the foot right because	79.08	3.359
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	then there will be an entire collapse of	80.52	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	a Nani group banks will collapse bunch	82.439	4.141
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	of other stocks will collapse there will	84.96	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	be Mayhem in the economy so it is highly	86.58	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	unlikely that they will sell it promote	88.5	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	us and their allies are highly unlikely	90.18	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that they will sell it so this entire	92.04	3.42
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	float issue again this is something that	93.72	3.24
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	I have explained on the main video you	95.46	3.299
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	will understand it so this float issue	96.96	4.019
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is designed in such a way that it feels	98.759	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	unlikely that adani stocks are going to	100.979	3.901
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	fall quite aggressively third and final	103.079	3.421
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	point is that does that mean that hey	104.88	3.239
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this is a great buying opportunity in	106.5	3.479
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	adani stocks now in case you don't want	108.119	3.721
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	to invest in such dangerous stocks you	109.979	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	can consider checking top hundred stocks	111.84	3.36

LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	it if you simply share it on social	169.5	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	media if you like this video If you	171.36	3.599

LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	some traction and will make people more	174.959	4.381
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	aware as to what is the reality of the	177.0	4.2
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	stock market so let's kick start our	179.34	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	discussion and you will learn a lot of	181.2	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	complicated Finance corporate governance	183.06	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	corporate management related issues so	185.16	4.02
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	please watch this carefully and make	187.56	3.959
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	notes so let's go Point by point and	189.18	4.02
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	there are seven critical points that you	191.519	3.841
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	need to understand first critical point	193.2	4.619
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is that what exactly does hinderberg do	195.36	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	what have they said and what is the	197.819	4.261
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	motive behind all this so hinderberg is	199.68	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	a research investment and whistleblower	202.08	4.26
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	organization so to say all rolled into	204.0	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	one so what they basically do is that	206.34	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	they do something called as Short	208.5	3.659
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Selling so short selling in very easy to	209.94	4.14
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	understand term means that let's say the	212.159	3.601
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	stock price today of a particular stock	214.08	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is 100 rupees and you know for sure that	215.76	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this stock price is going to fall to 60	218.4	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	rupees so what exactly is it that you	220.2	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	should be doing so you should be selling	222.72	4.2
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	it now at 100 rupees and when the stock	224.58	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	price Falls to 60 rupees you should buy	226.92	3.959
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	it so that way you are making a profit	228.9	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	of 40 rupees now you say that you know I	230.879	3.061
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	don't get this option of doing it on	232.68	3.36
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	zeruda how is this done so this is done	233.94	4.799
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	in fno of Futures and options market so	236.04	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	you don't need to worry about Romantics	238.739	3.241
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	how to do fno will I be able to	240.42	3.599
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	understand this concept all this nothing	241.98	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	like this what you simply need to	244.019	3.541
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	understand is that hinderberg is very	245.7	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	good in terms of short selling stocks	247.56	4.62
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	they pick up candidates where they feel	249.78	4.319
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that there are vulnerabilities they	252.18	3.899
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	analyze those companies they do a lot of	254.099	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Investigation release reports do some	256.079	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	kind of whistle blowing and they end up	258.479	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	shorting those stocks and making crazy	260.519	4.321
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	amount of money so in this context on	262.139	5.821
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	23rd Jan 2023 hinderberg came out with a	264.84	5.52
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	report titled adani group how the	267.96	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	world's third richest man is pulling the	270.36	4.559
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	largest Con in corporate history and	272.52	3.959
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	they have released a very dense Report	274.919	3.961
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	with references to a lot of Articles lot	276.479	4.801
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	of primary secondary investigation and	278.88	4.379
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the resources and research seems	281.28	4.26
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	legitimate obvious question of a lot of	283.259	3.961
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	people would be that you know what this	285.54	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is politically motivated this company is	287.22	4.62
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	incorrect they are against adaniji they	289.5	4.199
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	are against India see I am not here to	291.84	3.9
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	comment on that but couple of important	293.699	3.661
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	points that you need to understand that	295.74	3.42
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this company has done it to a lot of	297.36	3.839
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	listed companies in the past including	299.16	3.539
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	something like Twitter and have	301.199	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	successfully short sold their stocks	302.699	4.081
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this is point number one that you must	304.919	3.601
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	understand Point number two is that	306.78	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	there is no fire without smoke now there	308.52	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	are thousands of listed companies not	310.56	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	only in India but also the US now why	312.18	3.84
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	would this company handpick only adani	314.16	3.84
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	so there are counter arguments to both	316.02	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	these things but let me very quickly	318.0	3.84
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	show you as to what this firm has done	319.8	3.959
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	in the past are they only going after	321.84	4.62
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	adaniji so from the year 2020 onwards	323.759	5.401
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this company has shorted 30 stocks	326.46	5.4
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	including Tesla and this company has had	329.16	4.319
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	a very good track record in terms of	331.86	3.779
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	shorting stocks making money and along	333.479	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the way doing all this whistleblowing	335.639	3.84
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that it is currently doing with adani so	337.259	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	there are two ways to look at this story	339.479	3.481
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	number one is that Hindenburg is a	340.979	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	corrupt company and it is doing some	342.96	3.06
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	kind of Foul Play and it is against	344.639	3.241
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	India's growth of this that right so I	346.02	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	will not comment there you make up your	347.88	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	own mind my job is not to sway you one	349.56	4.26
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	way or the other the second key way of	351.6	3.48
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	looking at the story is that maybe	353.82	3.24
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	hinderberg goes after companies or	355.08	4.2
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	malicious companies where it finds some	357.06	4.199
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	kind of income incriminating or credible	359.28	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	evidence so that is how you can	361.259	4.741
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	interpret the entire story so therefore	363.66	4.319
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	we should have a Viewpoint that cello we	366.0	3.479
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	are going to analyze the facts	367.979	3.301
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	independently so let's start doing that	369.479	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	in context of this report that has been	371.28	4.02
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	published against adanis but before that	373.139	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	let me very quickly show you the	375.3	3.48
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	company's overall record so they have	376.919	3.06
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	shorted a bunch of other different	378.78	3.18
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	companies and generally they have been	379.979	4.321
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	fairly successful so this is not a	381.96	4.1
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	hit-and-run type of a company	384.3	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and you know then we'll run away no they	386.06	4.479
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	are making good money shorting companies	388.74	3.899
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and ultimately the market also believes	390.539	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	in that narrative so this is a very	392.639	3.241
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	important point that you need to keep in	394.319	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	mind a classic case in point is of	395.88	4.2
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Nikola so this was a listed company that	397.919	4.141
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	hinderberg ultimately shorted and it	400.08	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	created Ruckus in the entire market and	402.06	4.859
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	from 34 billion dollar market cap the	404.46	5.459
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	market cap of Nikola fell to 1.3 billion	406.919	4.921
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	dollar after that whistle blowing	409.919	3.961
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	incident and I'm very very worried that	411.84	3.9
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	something similar might happen in adani	413.88	4.319
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	ji's case also so now let's start going	415.74	4.679
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	through specific points there are six	418.199	3.481
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	more points that I am going to discuss	420.419	3.181
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	so Point number two that you need to	421.68	3.959
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	remember is that most of adaniji's	423.6	4.439
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	wealth has been built in the last three	425.639	5.101
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	years yes that is correct and to what	428.039	5.341
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	extent almost 85 percent of his wealth	430.74	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	has been built in the last three years	433.38	4.319
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	now ask yourself another very important	435.24	4.739
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	question that what is the source for	437.699	5.301
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this wealth you will say you know	439.979	3.021
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	it is that okay so let me ask you	443.84	5.079
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	another question it was after 2020 that	446.22	4.259
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Gotham adani ji's wealth has	448.919	4.201
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	extrapolated or has grown massively now	450.479	4.081
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	just think about it that there is	453.12	3.359
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	recession markets have not been doing	454.56	3.84
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	well so many negative things have	456.479	3.901
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	happened the market has stayed sideways	458.4	3.419
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	but I failed to understand the reason	460.38	3.42
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	why when all the companies are falling	461.819	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	adani stocks are rising and adaniji's	463.8	4.26
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	personal wealth is growing well there is	466.319	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	a stock market related answer to it and	468.06	4.079
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that has been revealed in the report and	470.039	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	what hinderberg is basically saying is	472.139	4.141
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	let's see 120 billion dollar of wealth	473.819	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	has been created with over 100 billion	476.28	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	coming in the last three years largely	478.259	4.981
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	through meteoric appreciation of stock	480.84	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	price now how does this exactly play out	483.24	4.079
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that stock rise increase adds to	485.28	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	adaniji's wealth okay so very very quick	487.319	3.421
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	summary there so here is how the math	489.06	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	works so let's assume that adaniji owns	490.74	5.34
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	75 percent of adani Enterprises and in	492.78	5.58
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	2020 hypothetically speaking adani	496.08	4.14
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Enterprises stock price is 100 rupees	498.36	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	now it somehow happens that the stock	500.22	6.36
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	price goes to 300 rupees so it has 3x so	502.8	5.76
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	how much do you think adani G's wealth	506.58	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	has increased well the short answer is	508.56	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that it has gone up by 3x as well why	510.3	4.619
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	because the stock price of adani	513.06	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Enterprise went up by 3x so this is how	514.919	4.86
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	increase in stock price impacts	517.8	3.599
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	someone's wealth now comes the second	519.779	3.541
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	point that how exactly has the stock	521.399	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	price went up and why has it went up and	523.32	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	what has been the winning recipe there	525.899	3.661
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	well the short answer there is that this	527.7	4.02
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	has been a debt fueled growth debt	529.56	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	simply means that how much money you are	531.72	3.119
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	borrowing and reinvesting in your	533.16	4.26
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	business and due to some effect it is	534.839	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	reflecting into your stock price so that	537.42	4.02
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is is what can be called as debt fueled	539.399	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	growth so to say and we all know and	541.44	4.26
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this can be checked the books are in	543.779	4.321
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	public and you can go and figure out how	545.7	4.62
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	much debt adani ji have so just to give	548.1	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	you an estimate of Financial Health this	550.32	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is a very important ratio which is	552.48	3.419
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	called as the current ratio so the	553.92	4.14
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	formula of current ratio is current	555.899	5.821
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	assets over current liabilities now if	558.06	5.58
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the current ratio is 1 what does that	561.72	3.48
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	mean it means that some company has	563.64	3.42
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	assets assets are things which are	565.2	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	positive what are liabilities and	567.06	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	liabilities are key obligations so if	568.86	4.68
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the current ratio is one it indicates	571.62	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that some person or some company will be	573.54	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	easily able to manage its liabilities	575.7	4.259
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	because it has equal number of Assets	577.92	4.919
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Now if this ratio goes below one then it	579.959	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	can create a lot of problem for a	582.839	3.781
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	company why because let's say in adani	584.339	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Green's case the current ratio is 0.5	586.62	4.62
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	what does this mean it means that the	588.839	5.161
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	assets are half that of liabilities that	591.24	4.86
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	liabilities are 2x but assets are X	594.0	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	which is a slight problem because it	596.1	4.14
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	indicates that in the short term the	598.44	4.14
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	company runs the risk of not meeting its	600.24	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	obligations now the worrying factor is	602.58	4.259
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that out of seven listed adani companies	604.62	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	five are facing this problem as of now	606.839	4.68
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	so this is a debt fuel business which is	609.36	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	looking at short-term liability problems	611.519	3.841
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	so this is a critical point another	613.32	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	related point is that in a lot of adani	615.36	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	groups company the promoters are	617.64	4.199
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	pledging their stocks now what is the	619.74	3.599
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	meaning of pledging pledging means that	621.839	3.12
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	for example you have a house you	623.339	3.601
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	mortgage that house for a loan from A	624.959	4.861
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	bank you go to HDFC bank and give me	626.94	4.76
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	some money in return I'm mortgaging it	629.82	4.26
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	I'm going to return it so that is	631.7	4.12
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	precisely what happens in pledged	634.08	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	promoter holding also that sometimes	635.82	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	promoters go and pledge their stocks	637.86	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	gear Mi stocks it is a super high crazy	640.14	4.62
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	value give us some loans in return so	642.36	5.7
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	under 99.99 cases this pledge promoter	644.76	5.22
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	holding is not a healthy sign for a	648.06	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	company it just indicates that there is	649.98	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	a lot of debt that the company has taken	652.38	4.199
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	now on top of this they are releasing an	654.36	4.56

LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	hinderberg has highlighted and basically	704.399	3.601
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	what they are saying is that the company	706.26	3.36
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	management or a lot of company	708.0	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	management is involved in Shady	709.62	4.14
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	practices from their past for example	711.54	3.9
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	take a look at this article you will see	713.76	4.199
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that Rajesh adani who is currently the	715.44	4.8
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	managing director of adani Enterprises	717.959	4.921
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	he was jailed in a fraud case so this is	720.24	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	never a good sign he was involved in tax	722.88	4.26
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	evasion he was arrested twice now you'll	724.98	3.859
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	see that yeah	727.14	4.199
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	I'm not like a legal expert I will leave	728.839	4.541
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	it up to you you guys can go use Google	731.339	3.961
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and form your own opinions on said	733.38	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	individuals then comes the second case	735.3	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and this is for Mr Samir Vora who is	737.04	4.62
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	related to Mr adani and he was also	739.26	5.1
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	involved in a Diamond Trading scam so	741.66	5.16
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	again all this reference data has been	744.36	4.919
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	given again you can use Google and try	746.82	4.98
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	to investigate the answer here so on top	749.279	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	of this several other members of the	751.8	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	adani family are involved into all of	753.839	3.661
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this stuff now this is not a healthy	755.76	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	sign and this is where I will leave the	757.5	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	conversation so I will not get into the	759.36	3.18
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	name dropping of everything that has	761.16	2.88
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	been said on the report I will link the	762.54	3.419
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	report also you can go and read it but	764.04	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	to cut the long story short that yes	765.959	3.301
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this is definitely not a healthy	767.7	3.18
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	corporate drug test that if your family	769.26	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is extensively involved in everyday	770.88	4.019
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	decision making only your family is	772.98	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	involved in this independent Auditors	774.899	3.961
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	are not there so all this points to bad	776.94	4.26
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	bad stuff so now comes the next Finance	778.86	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	oriented point that the float of the	781.2	4.8
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	company is very very less now what is	783.6	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the meaning of float and why is this	786.0	3.48
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	such an important issue specially given	787.68	3.959
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	adani's context let me take a couple of	789.48	3.84
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	minutes to explain you this complicated	791.639	3.841
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Finance topic now the concept of float	793.32	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	can be understood in the following way	795.48	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	so for example if you go on screener and	796.86	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	read the shareholding pattern for any	799.44	4.139
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	company you will get this entire list	801.42	4.8
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	for example here if you press on adani	803.579	4.861
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Enterprises and look at promoter holding	806.22	4.98
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	you will see that Rani G has roughly 73	808.44	5.519
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	percent of holding in his company so	811.2	4.86
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this is what promoter holding is now	813.959	3.541
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	think about it this way that the	816.06	5.839
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	promoter owns 73 of the company rest 27	817.5	6.839
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	hypothetically is assumed by external	821.899	4.481
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	parties for example public might be	824.339	4.861
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	owning it some FIS diis might be owning	826.38	5.22
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	it now how does the stock price move	829.2	5.28
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	well the stock price is a game of supply	831.6	6.419
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and demand for example if the demand of	834.48	5.88
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the stock is very high but but no one is	838.019	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	willing to supply or sell their stocks	840.36	3.24
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	then what do you think will happen to	842.459	3.06
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the stock well the demand curve will	843.6	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	shift rightwards and the stock price	845.519	4.201
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	will go up now again back to this	847.38	4.259
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	concept of float what happens here is	849.72	5.22
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that this 73 percent of promoter holding	851.639	5.94
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is completely under the promoter if he	854.94	4.8
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	or she does not want to sell what does	857.579	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the float become it becomes 27 percent	859.74	5.719
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that is what the float is	862.019	3.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	if the promoter does not want because	865.519	4.481
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the promoter might not want to sell a	867.959	3.68
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	stock at all	870.0	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	then due to external factors if the	871.639	4.841
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	demand of the stock is going up but the	874.5	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	supply is very limited then the price of	876.48	5.219
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	a stock can be skyrocketed so hinderberg	879.06	4.68
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	report Elijah is that adani is	881.699	4.2
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	manipulating the entire stock holding	883.74	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	pattern plus they are creating a series	885.899	4.921
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	of shell companies that are buying adani	888.18	4.92
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	stocks and they have maintained a very	890.82	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	very small proportion of the float and	893.1	4.799
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	using that entire gimmick they have been	895.56	4.62
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	able to pump up the stock so how does	897.899	3.721
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that mechanism play out let me just	900.18	2.94
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	quickly show it to you by presenting	901.62	3.48
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	some relevant data so if you take a look	903.12	3.719
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	at adani group shareholding pattern you	905.1	3.239
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	will see that whether you take a look at	906.839	3.86
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	adani transmission nadani Enterprises	908.339	6.06
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	total gas it is very close to 75 percent	910.699	6.341
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	now the 75 percent is a very important	914.399	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	figure because because as per se B	917.04	5.94
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	mandate you need to have 25 or more in	918.959	6.421
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	public shareholding so public or	922.98	5.039
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	non-promoters need to have 25 or more	925.38	4.68
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	holding of a particular listed company	928.019	4.68
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and the promoters need to decrease it	930.06	4.8
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this is specifically to manage that	932.699	3.541
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	float issue so there are certain	934.86	2.76
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	mandates I'm not getting into the	936.24	4.2
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	details of it but the 75 percent is a	937.62	4.98
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	very important threshold and adani these	940.44	3.959
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	companies are very close to that but in	942.6	3.419
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	adani's Enterprise case there is	944.399	2.88
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	something very interesting that is	946.019	2.88
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	happening now according to business	947.279	4.321
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	standard article a bunch of Mauritius	948.899	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Cayman Island companies have been	951.6	5.099
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	created and they have ties to adani and	953.639	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	now you'll say that okay what will they	956.699	3.241
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	do by creating companies in km and I	957.959	4.081
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	learned Mauritius all this stuff okay	959.94	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	well they can buy a lot of stocks so	962.04	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	back to the float concept so if you	964.68	3.719
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	consider that promoters hold 75 percent	966.42	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	of a company now shell companies which	968.399	4.261
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	have been created in Mauritius all these	970.8	3.899
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	different different fancy locations they	972.66	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	own like 15 of the company they are	974.699	4.2
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	indirectly controlled by the promoter	977.22	3.9
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	then what is the actual float that is	978.899	5.581
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	left so that would be 75 plus 1590 minus	981.12	5.88
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	100 so only 10 percent float might be	984.48	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	left so I'm just putting this as a	987.0	2.76
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	hypothetical number just to help you	988.26	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	understand the concept but I hope you	989.76	4.079
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	get the point that by creating a bunch	991.8	4.14
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	of shell companies and making them	993.839	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	invest or buy your stocks and taking	995.94	5.1
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	control of it this entire float amount	998.279	5.281
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	can be brought down and the report goes	1001.04	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	into the nitty-gritties of it and they	1003.56	3.24
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	have named The Firm that is doing that	1005.12	3.48
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	so there is a company called as Monty	1006.8	4.62
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Rosa investment holding it controls five	1008.6	4.799
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	other companies for example they control	1011.42	5.94
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	apms Cresta LTS albula Lotus whatever	1013.399	6.721
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and all these companies have poured in	1017.36	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this much money these are in billion	1020.12	3.12
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	dollars right this is not like small	1021.8	3.899
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	amount and their only investment is in	1023.24	4.199
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	adani group or majority of their	1025.699	3.661
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	investment is in adani group companies	1027.439	4.081
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	only this looks very very shady that	1029.36	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	this singular entity if it is making	1031.52	3.179
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	let's say 100 billion dollars worth of	1033.02	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Investments almost this percentage is	1034.699	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	going to adani stocks it has been also	1037.1	4.319
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	said that when it comes to this	1039.439	4.081
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	particular holding company Monte Rosa	1041.419	4.981
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	chairman and CEO served as director in	1043.52	4.86
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	three companies alongside a fugitive	1046.4	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Diamond Merchant who allegedly stole 1	1048.38	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	billion before fleeing vinod adani's	1050.48	4.199
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	daughter married The Fugitive Diamond	1052.94	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Merchant so there has been a link that	1054.679	3.421
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	has been established between that	1056.72	3.3
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Mauritius based group that is buying a	1058.1	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	lot of adani stocks and adani grew so as	1060.02	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	a result what ends up happening is that	1062.84	3.18
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the float amount becomes really really	1064.46	3.3
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	small it becomes like maybe less than 10	1066.02	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	percent and now what happens that and as	1067.76	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	per this economic model that I was	1069.98	4.92
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	explaining you that if the demand can be	1072.14	4.68
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	pumped up that you know what madani ji	1074.9	4.019
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is going to be the next big thing Supply	1076.82	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is is control no one is willing to sell	1078.919	3.901
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	it what will happen to all the adani	1080.9	4.26
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	stock price that it will Skyrocket and	1082.82	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that is precisely what has happened with	1085.16	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	adani stocks and that is precisely what	1087.2	4.8
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is created a lot of wealth for adanis so	1089.66	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	to cut the long story short the stock	1092.0	3.419
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	pumping takes place by doing something	1093.62	3.84
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	called as rounded tripping that adani	1095.419	3.421
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	groups there are a bunch of listed	1097.46	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	companies they create a bunch of shell	1098.84	4.86
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	companies adani office invests in these	1101.12	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	companies and these companies end up	1103.7	4.2
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	purchasing adani Group stock as a result	1105.86	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	there is very little float that is	1107.9	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	maintained majority of the stock is a de	1109.64	4.919
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	facto that means as a matter of fact is	1112.46	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	controlled by the promoters and their	1114.559	4.021
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	allies so this brings us to the next	1116.84	3.3
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	point that all this round tripping is	1118.58	3.0
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	happening why are authorities not doing	1120.14	3.24
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	something about it the CB does not know	1121.58	4.14
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	I cannot say all that stuff but in order	1123.38	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	to get all these documents you need like	1125.72	4.079
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	good Auditors you need like good	1127.88	3.9
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	compliance you need like good management	1129.799	4.441
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	which is looking into the transparency	1131.78	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	aspect of it but here is the problem	1134.24	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that a lot of Associates of adanis are	1136.22	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	also very Shady so to say now what do I	1138.74	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	mean by that and the report goes into	1140.78	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	the details that for example there was a	1142.28	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	brokerage firm called as Monarch net	1144.32	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	worth Capital now this company was hand	1146.36	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	paid to book run the adani green Energy	1148.64	3.84
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	share book Running simply means that	1150.86	3.9
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	getting stocks in the listed Market or	1152.48	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	doing fpo of that or doing some kind of	1154.76	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	financing for those stocks so that is	1157.22	3.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	what book Running means these are	1159.08	3.479
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	parties that are underwriting the stocks	1160.76	3.539
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and helping the party now this company	1162.559	3.601
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	itself has been mired with a lot of	1164.299	3.601
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	problems for example if you simply	1166.16	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Google Monarch Network Capital CB you	1167.9	4.26
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	will see that that orders have been	1170.66	3.36
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	released by sebi to look into Monarch	1172.16	3.48
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	net worth Capital so all this Shady	1174.02	3.0
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	stuff is happening now you'll say that	1175.64	3.3
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	okay this is an external party why does	1177.02	3.539
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	it matter now then comes allegation	1178.94	3.599
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	number two that adanis are working with	1180.559	3.961
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	ketan parekh in order to pump up their	1182.539	3.661
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	stock so for people who do not know who	1184.52	3.14
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	ketan parekh is	1186.2	3.599
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	pumped a lot of stocks in the Indian	1187.66	4.54
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	stock market a few years back and he was	1189.799	4.021
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	banned from trading in the stock market	1192.2	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	then he went to London and continued to	1193.82	4.859
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	operate in a clandestine manner in fact	1196.28	4.98
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	sucheta Dalal she tweeted and this was	1198.679	4.801
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	in context of caitan Parikh and adani	1201.26	3.9
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	you can go and read the sweet and draw	1203.48	3.8
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	your own inferences then comes that okay	1205.16	4.62
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	external party see what about internal	1207.28	4.42
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	issue any internal issue with adani ji	1209.78	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	well it has been alleged that their	1211.7	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Auditors are not clean for example the	1213.44	4.619
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	independent Auditors of adani Enterprise	1216.08	4.56
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and adani total gas is a tiny firm	1218.059	5.461
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	called as Shah dandaria and KO and these	1220.64	4.919
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	are the people who are freshly minted CS	1223.52	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	they ended up auditing these companies	1225.559	3.901
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	now I am not leveling any personal	1227.84	3.42
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	allegation I am just literally picking	1229.46	3.3
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	up photos and data that has been	1231.26	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	established on the report itself now it	1232.76	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	looks very very shady that some	1235.22	4.14
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	inexperienced people would go and start	1236.72	4.68
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	auditing these high-powered companies	1239.36	4.02
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	that have billions of dollars of	1241.4	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	valuation in the stock market also the	1243.38	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	size of the company is very small now	1245.72	3.3
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	again I'll have to check the details but	1247.34	3.06
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	it was a four or five percent company	1249.02	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	hardly any full-time employees all that	1250.4	4.139
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	stuff so it does not reflect well on	1252.62	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	such a big conglomerate hiring such	1254.539	4.321
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	small Auditors to do independent audits	1256.4	4.86
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	on so then comes the final point that	1258.86	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	okay what can we draw from all these	1261.26	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	inferences data that has been presented	1263.36	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	on the report I have only touched the	1265.22	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	surface if you want to read the entire	1267.32	3.3
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	report please go and feel free to read	1268.88	4.02
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	it I have encapsulated the major points	1270.62	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	but in summary these are a few key	1272.9	3.779
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	things that I will say Point number one	1274.7	4.02
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	is that adani stocks are hyper inflated	1276.679	4.201
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	no doubt about that even before this	1278.72	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	report was released almost everyone can	1280.88	4.74
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	unanimously say that adani stocks are	1283.16	4.92
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	over inflated this is the first key	1285.62	4.32
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Point second key point that you should	1288.08	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	know is that Indian mutual fund houses	1289.94	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	have generally avoided adani stocks	1291.74	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	buying something like LIC which has	1294.44	4.08
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	poured in a lot of money in adanis God	1296.24	4.319
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	knows why there are very few large	1298.52	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	institutional investors in India that	1300.559	3.901
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	have poured money into adani stocks so	1302.48	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	mutual funds have been relatively Safe	1304.46	3.599
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and Smart from that particular angle	1306.2	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	point number three is that hinderberg	1308.059	4.021
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	has levied its allegation adaniji will	1309.98	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	give some kind of counter arguments now	1312.08	3.12
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	there will be commenters on this YouTube	1313.7	2.64
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	video you will say that you know what	1315.2	2.459
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	you're against this and that and you are	1316.34	2.94
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	taking sides no I am not doing that I'm	1317.659	3.781
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	simply explaining you common sense that	1319.28	4.759
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	there is no fire without smoke	1321.44	5.099
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	therefore a company like hinderburg has	1324.039	4.421
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	generated so much proof against sadani	1326.539	4.02
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	now the good thing in the hinderberg	1328.46	3.48
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	report is that they have created a	1330.559	3.721
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	series of 85 88 questions that they want	1331.94	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	adani is to answer if adanis can give a	1334.28	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	very good response all these things get	1336.38	3.419
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	quashed and that's the end of the	1338.24	3.48
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	discussion everyone go their merry way	1339.799	4.321
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	but if adanis choose not to answer those	1341.72	4.199
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	88 questions it becomes like a slight	1344.12	3.36
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	issue so we'll have to wait and watch	1345.919	3.661
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and look at their response now comes the	1347.48	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	final point that if you are an investor	1349.58	3.479
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	in the stock market what does the future	1351.2	3.839
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	look like if adani ji is default on	1353.059	3.721
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	their debt again please go and check my	1355.039	3.241
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	video I will link it in the description	1356.78	3.6
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and comment box but the future does not	1358.28	4.379
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	look good if there is a massive collapse	1360.38	4.86
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	of adani it will take a lot of companies	1362.659	4.321
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	with it it will create a massive	1365.24	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	distrust and these type of things takes	1366.98	4.86
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	years to recover so we are looking at a	1369.62	3.96
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	very bad localized scenario and I	1371.84	3.18
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	personally will lose a lot of money	1373.58	3.42
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	despite having no exposure to adani	1375.02	4.019
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	stocks because I have invested a lot in	1377.0	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	Banks but that money is going to get hit	1379.039	4.5
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	at least for a few years so there is	1381.5	3.78
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	nothing that I can do on this I really	1383.539	3.541
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	hope that there is no fundamental issue	1385.28	3.66
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	all these things is a lie I will be the	1387.08	4.44
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	happiest person if nothing Shady comes	1388.94	4.38
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	out of adani groups because that way my	1391.52	3.24
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	money will also be safe in the stock	1393.32	3.599
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	market if it blows up then it will be a	1394.76	3.72
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	bad scenario and we are at least looking	1396.919	3.361
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	for two more years of pain thank you so	1398.48	3.36
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	much for watching do share your comments	1400.28	5.24
LLljt2SUqtQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLljt2SUqtQ	and Views and I'll see you the next time	1401.84	3.68
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the biggest lie young people are told	0.0	4.74
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	when they're 18 19 and 20 is money	2.1	4.679
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	doesn't grow on trees this process	4.74	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	starts in school when we're taught to	6.779	4.021
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	follow the traditional path of getting a	8.7	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	job and a mortgage which leads to work	10.8	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	in every hour of the day just to earn	12.78	4.98
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	enough money to retire at 67 and finally	14.7	5.52
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	die let's be real for a second do you	17.76	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	think that's how I make sixty seven	20.22	3.6
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	thousand two hundred and fifty Seven	21.84	4.38
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	dollars per week there is clearly	23.82	4.86
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	something else going on and no I'm not	26.22	4.379
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	talking about getting a high paid job or	28.68	3.84
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	starting a side hustle to achieve this	30.599	3.601
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you need a way of making money that	32.52	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	doesn't rely on you working day in day	34.2	4.859
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	out it's called passive income and here	36.3	4.98
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	are seven ideas I strongly suggest you	39.059	4.441
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	consider along with my ratings of age	41.28	5.52
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	idea one invest in stocks there's a bit	43.5	5.219
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	more to this than just invest in the	46.8	3.599
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	stock market and you'll make passive	48.719	3.541
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	income I mean I can see why people might	50.399	4.081
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	think this because let's say you buy a	52.26	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	share in a company and it goes up in	54.48	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	value technically you've generated some	56.28	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	money without doing anything but in	58.68	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	order to actually get your cash out you	60.78	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	have to sell your stock some would	63.0	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	consider this passive income but instead	64.68	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	I just think of it as a bonus and not	66.78	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	something to rely on I consider passive	68.82	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	income as nothing less than actual money	70.92	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	flowing into your bank account every	73.08	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	month without the need to sell the asset	75.06	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	that's making you the money that's why	77.22	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the only form of stock market investing	79.08	5.179
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	I consider to be real passive income is	81.0	5.7
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	dividend stocks these are chunks of	84.259	4.601
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	companies you can buy think Starbucks	86.7	4.98
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	Pepsi and McDonald's and in return for	88.86	4.619
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	owning them you get a share of the	91.68	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	profits paid directly into your pocket	93.479	3.901
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	as well as benefiting from the stock	95.64	3.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	going up in value is a bit of a bonus	97.38	3.599
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	they're one of the easiest ways to make	99.36	3.54
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	money on a consistent basis with	100.979	4.621
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	absolutely no work well that's as long	102.9	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	as you pick the right ones to invest in	105.6	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	I strongly suggest you listen to this	107.4	4.74
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	next part carefully so you avoid making	109.74	4.379
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	any crucial mistakes to help you sort	112.14	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the good from the bad dividend stocks	114.119	4.921
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	are ranked in a kind of social hierarchy	116.46	5.28
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	at the top you have dividend Kings these	119.04	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	are stocks that have not only paid a	121.74	3.54
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	dividend but actually increased it for	123.18	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	50 years in a row under that you have	125.28	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the dividend Aristocrats these are the	127.38	3.54
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	stocks that have increased their	129.72	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	dividends for 25 years that's where the	130.92	5.22
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	official definition stops but I like to	133.68	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	think of the stocks under this as	136.14	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	dividend working class sure some of them	137.64	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	will eventually become Aristocrats and	140.22	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	Kings however it's very hard to tell	142.26	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	which ones will make it I'd be very	144.12	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	cautious with these as a lot of people	146.04	3.66
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	get drawn in by companies offering	147.9	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	extremely high dividends I can	149.7	4.92
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	understand why but remember as much as	151.86	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	it's about the amount of money you're	154.62	4.259
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	being paid it's also essential that it's	156.12	4.92
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	sustainable long term so you can easily	158.879	4.021
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	compare these seven ideas I'm going to	161.04	3.6
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	rate them in three different categories	162.9	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	firstly how much time does dividend	164.64	5.34
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	investing take I'll rate this a one out	167.04	4.559
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	of five as all you have to do is	169.98	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	download and invest in app deposit some	171.599	4.621
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	money and buy a few dividend stocks look	174.0	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	this isn't financial advice but some	176.22	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	apps I'd recommend a moomoo for the year	178.26	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	sa and light year for the UK and Europe	180.12	4.92
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	apps like these often give out free	182.76	4.559
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	stocks for joining so if I find any then	185.04	3.66
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	I'll pop them down in the description	187.319	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	below secondly how much money do you	188.7	5.22
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	need I'll give this a 5 out of 5. as	191.099	4.681
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	it's so quick to do the trade-off is	193.92	3.66
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	that you need a lot of money invested to	195.78	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	make a significant income thirdly how	197.58	4.68
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	easy is it to make a hundred dollars per	200.34	4.259
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	week this also gets a five out of five	202.26	4.68
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	let's do the maths as Dividends are	204.599	4.381
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	calculated on a yearly basis and are	206.94	3.54
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	paid out at the end of each quarter	208.98	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	let's first work out how much money you	210.48	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	need per year which is pretty simple	212.94	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	there are 52 weeks in a year so let's	214.8	4.859
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	multiply that by 100 which gives us five	217.08	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	thousand two hundred dollars now let's	219.659	3.541
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	say we invest in one of my favorite	221.4	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	companies Starbucks Who currently pay an	223.2	6.179
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	annual dividend at 2.4 in order to make	225.9	5.58
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	five thousand two hundred dollars per	229.379	4.561
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	year or a hundred dollars per week you	231.48	4.38
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	would need to invest a grand total of	233.94	3.92
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	wait for it	235.86	6.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	216 600 66 dollars now I know what	237.86	6.519
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you're thinking this sounds great for	242.64	3.599
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	people that already have money but what	244.379	3.661
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	if I'm just starting out in that case	246.239	4.021
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	it's a much better idea to use your time	248.04	4.199
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	instead of your money to make passive	250.26	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	income which is what the next idea is	252.239	5.761
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	all about idea two automate a side	254.58	4.98
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	hustle a lot of people don't understand	258.0	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the difference between a job and an	259.56	4.199
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	automated side hustle when I was younger	261.78	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	I had a friend called Jamie who had a	263.759	3.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	small dog training business he was	265.68	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	fantastic at what he did I remember him	267.479	5.22
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	seeing tame the craziest of dogs one day	269.82	4.74
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	when we were sitting in the park I asked	272.699	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	him how much money he made and I was	274.56	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	surprised to find out he was only just	276.479	3.601
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	getting by it didn't really make sense	278.34	4.139
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	to me how such a skilled person who	280.08	4.74
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	obviously had a lot of value to give was	282.479	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	unable to make the money he deserved if	284.82	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	we put aside the fact that he probably	286.919	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	wasn't charging enough we get to the	288.6	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	real issue which was the business model	290.699	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	he only had a limited amount of hours he	292.68	4.519
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	could sell and dogs he could train	295.139	4.441
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	therefore he could only earn so much	297.199	4.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	before his potential was capped as at	299.58	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the time there was no way to automate	301.919	3.541
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	and scale it but now we have the	303.84	3.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	internet these little side hustles can	305.46	4.38
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	become much more passive and make a lot	307.56	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	more money so how do you go from having	309.84	3.54
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a skill like Jamie to having an	311.58	3.899
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	automated side hustle well here's the	313.38	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	steps I'd take and I'm pretty sure I	315.479	3.421
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	could turn a small side hustle like	317.34	3.48
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	Jamie's into a million dollar business	318.9	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	nowadays firstly you have to identify	320.82	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	what you're really good at ideally you	323.16	3.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	should have some kind of unfair	325.44	3.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	Advantage but this is where the majority	326.88	4.379
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	of people get caught in the same trap as	329.16	4.259
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	Jamie as they start to sell every minute	331.259	4.261
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	of their time for a small amount of	333.419	4.021
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	money instead you need to focus every	335.52	4.019
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	waking hour on building a digital asset	337.44	4.38
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	of some kind so Jamie this could have	339.539	4.021
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	been a Blog where he talked about	341.82	4.86
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	training dogs manual for owners to train	343.56	5.82
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	their own pets or a course that teaches	346.68	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	other people how to start a dog training	349.38	4.68
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	side hustle secondly when you've decided	351.3	4.8
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	what kind of digital asset you want to	354.06	3.84
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	build you have to put it on the internet	356.1	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	so that your future customers can find	357.9	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the best solution I found for this is a	360.0	4.199
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	tool called hostinger which is an	362.4	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	all-in-one platform I'm talking hosting	364.199	4.681
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	website builder logo maker and free	366.36	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	domain name with annual plan I'll	368.88	3.539
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	personally choose this as the drag and	370.8	3.839
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	drop website builder makes it so easy as	372.419	4.381
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	I don't have any coding skills then it's	374.639	4.201
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	just a case of effectively advertising	376.8	4.86
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	your digital product on social media I'd	378.84	5.22
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	highly recommend making viral Tech talks	381.66	4.379

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	effort so how much time does automate in	387.96	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a side hustle take well if you're doing	390.539	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	it on your own I'd give it a five out of	392.22	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	five as it does take a while to build	394.319	3.66
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the digital product and then you have	396.12	3.84
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the added headache of making a website	397.979	3.901
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	however if you do decide to use	399.96	3.84
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	something like hostinger then I'll give	401.88	4.319
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	this a three hour five as you don't need	403.8	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	to worry about having any technical or	406.199	4.381
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	design skills for the website that you	408.36	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	can just use the built-in AI website	410.58	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	builder to make the website for you or	412.56	5.16
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	alternatively you could use the designer	415.02	4.739
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	made templates which is great news for a	417.72	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	boom like me but for the people that are	419.759	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a bit more knowledgeable you can further	422.16	3.599
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	grow your website by choosing the	424.199	3.241

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	how much money you need I'd give this a	427.44	4.68
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	one hour five as this passive income	430.08	3.839
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	idea is way more about spending your	432.12	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	time than your money it depends what	433.919	4.141
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	digital product you want to build but if	436.02	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	it's just the course of some kind you	438.06	3.539
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	can do all of that on your laptop using	439.8	3.54
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a program like canva when it comes to	441.599	3.481
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	hosting it on the internet if you get	443.34	4.02

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	out at less than three dollars a month	447.36	3.42
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	I've actually been using hostinger for a	448.8	3.54
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	while now so I thought as I was	450.78	3.479
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	mentioning it so much in the video why	452.34	3.479
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	not reach out to them and see if I could	454.259	3.241
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	get a discount they actually did get	455.819	3.6
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	back to me so if you use the code Mark	457.5	4.62

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	hundred dollars a week I'd give this a	467.819	3.901
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	one out of five because once you're up	469.74	3.84

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	been hoarded by the traditional media	500.819	4.5

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	idea how much money was in advertising	507.66	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	until YouTube opened their doors for the	509.759	4.261
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	public to create their own content then	511.86	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the curtain was well and truly lifted	514.02	4.439
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the traditional media hate it and that's	516.0	4.38
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	why every opportunity they try and	518.459	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	discredit social media the people	520.38	4.8
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	leveraging online content are dipping	522.779	3.841
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	their hands into the previously	525.18	3.659
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	extremely guarded Money Pot and	526.62	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	rightfully taken their fair share it	528.839	3.601
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	still shocks me how some people don't	530.76	3.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	understand how content creators make	532.44	4.8
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	money I mean the concept of advertising	534.48	5.34
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	is hundreds of years old and online ads	537.24	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	are far more trackable than just putting	539.82	4.68
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a random advert on the TV and hoping it	541.8	4.86
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	increases a business's sales here's the	544.5	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	best piece of advice I've received about	546.66	4.98
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	social media it's not if you do it it's	548.7	5.4
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	how well you do it so how can we use it	551.64	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	to make money well it's like I	554.1	3.359
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	previously mentioned you can start a	555.72	3.84
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	YouTube channel and once you reach a	557.459	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	thousand subscribers and 4 000 watch	559.56	4.14
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	hours you can start getting paid from	561.779	3.901
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the adverts on your videos whenever I	563.7	3.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	say this to people they come back with	565.68	3.599
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	something like well the people that	567.42	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	succeed are just lucky maybe this was	569.279	4.021
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the case a couple of years ago but now	571.44	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	if your content's good and designed for	573.3	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the algorithm you will be successful the	575.22	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	harsh truth is too many people think	577.62	3.659
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	their content is good when it's actually	579.54	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	just terrible and no one wants to tell	581.279	4.261
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	them this this is because they only ask	583.56	3.959
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	family and friends who sugarcoat the	585.54	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	truth to protect their feelings if you	587.519	4.801
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	want an honest judgment you need to ask	589.98	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	people who don't care about offending	592.32	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you care more about people who don't	594.54	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	care about you it's best to pick	596.58	3.36
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	whatever you feel the most comfortable	598.32	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	with be that writing taking photos	599.94	5.579
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	speaking into a microphone or recording	602.82	4.98
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a full-blown video as long as you can	605.519	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	capture people's attention then you're	607.8	3.539
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	on to a winner it's also worth	609.959	3.0
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	mentioning that picking a niche is	611.339	3.721
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	important in the early days of the	612.959	4.141
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	internet you get away with talking about	615.06	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	anything and everything but now there is	617.1	4.739
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	so much competition that you need to	619.68	3.839
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	specialize in something in particular	621.839	3.781
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	think about it like your favorite TV	623.519	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	show every time you tune in you kind of	625.62	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	know what to expect similar characters	628.019	5.161
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	locations and story lines so you want to	630.12	5.58
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	make sure your viewers know what kind of	633.18	4.86
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	content you produce and put it out on a	635.7	4.38
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	regular basis this also makes it a lot	638.04	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	easier for you to attract sponsorship	640.08	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	opportunities I like to think of every	641.94	3.899
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	video I put on this channel as a little	644.04	3.479
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	asset that will make me money for years	645.839	4.261
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	to come it also helps in this extremely	647.519	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	fun to make content so how much time	650.1	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	does content creation take I'm going to	652.079	4.621
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	give this a 5 out of five rating as it's	654.18	4.68
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	one of the most time consuming things in	656.7	3.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the world I'm not going to beat around	658.86	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	on the bush but making content is a long	660.42	4.859
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	hard process I mean this video has	663.3	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	probably taken us more than five days to	665.279	4.201
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	produce however the upsides are worth it	667.26	4.8
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	in my opinion just think the harder that	669.48	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	something is to do the less competition	672.06	4.98
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you actually have now how much money do	674.1	5.46
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you need this is a one out of five as	677.04	4.979
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you really don't need much to start I	679.56	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	see way too many people buying the	682.019	3.781
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	latest equipment or going on crazy long	683.76	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	courses to learn how to create content	685.8	5.46
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	this is a terrible idea you just need to	688.2	5.639
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	become an avid consumer of whatever you	691.26	4.92
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	want to create take the good part from	693.839	3.961
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	all of those different things and then	696.18	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	mix them with your own ideas there's a	697.8	5.039

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	within a couple of months of starting	709.38	4.26

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	types sharks and Angels some stay angels	758.64	5.46
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	and some morph into sharks but it'll	761.82	4.319
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	help you to know the difference Angels	764.1	3.84
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	often invest in businesses run by	766.139	3.901
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	friends and family they often don't have	767.94	3.959
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	lots of money nor an interest in taking	770.04	3.539
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	control of the business they're	771.899	3.18
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	generally seen as nicer and more	773.579	3.721
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	forgiving hence their name on the other	775.079	4.861
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	hand sharks May invest small amounts of	777.3	4.979
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	money but have deeper pockets they may	779.94	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	also seek a control in interest at the	782.279	3.781
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	start as they're confident their	784.44	3.6
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	expertise can make the business more	786.06	4.019
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	profitable and therefore grow their	788.04	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	investment I'm personally more inclined	790.079	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	towards the shark end of the spectrum as	792.06	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	I like to have as much control over my	794.279	4.321
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	investments as possible but whichever	796.26	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	private investment strategy you pick you	798.6	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	can also combine it with content	800.76	3.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	creation believe it or not the actor	802.56	4.079
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	Ryan Reynolds is a great example of this	804.48	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	he's one of the smartest people on the	806.639	3.721
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	planet right now and I'm not	808.98	3.659
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	exaggerating he's extremely good at	810.36	4.74
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	playing the everyday guy but under the	812.639	4.741
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	mask he's a business savvy venture	815.1	4.38
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	capitalist with many multi-million	817.38	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	dollar exits under his belt giving him a	819.48	6.24
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	net worth of over 350 million dollars he	822.0	6.0
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	finds interesting companies offers to	825.72	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	buy a small percentage as an angel	828.0	5.22
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	investor uses his social media to drive	830.04	5.16
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	up the value and then when the company	833.22	4.619

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	business being successful in the future	874.68	3.36
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you also have to ask the entrepreneur	876.42	3.719
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	how dividends will be paid and their	878.04	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	ultimate exit strategy as that's how	880.139	3.781
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you're going to get the majority of your	882.36	3.779
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	money the actual investing part doesn't	883.92	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	take long as it's just the case of	886.139	3.241
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	handing over the money and being	888.0	3.24
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	assigned your percentage of the business	889.38	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	now how much money do you need I'm going	891.24	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	to give this a three out of five because	894.0	3.42
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	it really depends on the business that	895.68	3.659
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you're investing in I've personally	897.42	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	invested anywhere between a thousand and	899.339	4.321
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a hundred and dollars of course the	901.44	4.019
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	earlier you get in the less you're going	903.66	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	to have to invest but also the more risk	905.459	4.981
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you're taking so you have to decide how	907.98	4.74
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	much risk you're willing to take if you	910.44	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	do this I'd also recommend making more	912.72	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	than one investment as I've often found	915.06	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	that one good investment can make up for	917.04	5.28
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	nine bad ones but importantly how easy	919.32	4.98
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	is it to make a hundred dollars a week	922.32	3.84
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	I'm going to rate this a two out of five	924.3	3.24
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	because it really depends on your	926.16	3.299
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	negotiation skill and how much you	927.54	5.039
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	invest I've invested 5 000 in a business	929.459	4.981
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	and help them to upgrade their equipment	932.579	3.481
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	as well as helping them grow their	934.44	3.899
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	client base I started making an easy	936.06	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	hundred dollars per week in dividends	938.339	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the more value you can offer the more	940.32	4.319
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you'll get in return as you are taking	942.779	3.721
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	money out of the entrepreneur's pocket	944.639	4.081
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	but instead helping to grow the pot of	946.5	5.699
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	money for everyone idea five become an	948.72	5.4
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	affiliate marketer I remember when	952.199	4.621
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	recently a big bank had a promotion my	954.12	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	son's girlfriend sent a sign up link to	956.82	3.24

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	free ten dollars she was shocked by the	961.86	4.919
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	results every few hours a new friend had	964.38	4.079
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	signed up and thanked her for the free	966.779	3.721
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	cash before she knew it 30 of her	968.459	3.661
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	friends had signed up using the link and	970.5	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	she'd hit the limit but she wasn't just	972.12	4.38
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	doing this out the kindness of her heart	974.82	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	although she's a kind girl she also got	976.5	4.74
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	paid ten dollars for everyone that	979.26	4.319

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	imagine if there wasn't a limit she	987.779	3.901
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	could have made far more this is	989.699	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	essentially affiliate marketing but real	991.68	4.14

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	do this and now he's a multi-millionaire	1163.7	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	who spends more time on vacation with	1165.62	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	his wife than he does at home he noticed	1167.9	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a gap in the market for a digital tool	1170.24	3.12
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	that helped large membership	1172.22	3.36
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	organizations keep track of all their	1173.36	4.92
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	customers data at first he decided to	1175.58	4.86
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	sell his software as a one-time purchase	1178.28	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	however he always had to search for a	1180.44	4.739
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	new customer when he made the switch to	1182.84	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a subscription-based model he was able	1185.179	4.201
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	to make a very predictable amount of	1187.46	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	passive income every month well I say	1189.38	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	passive income of course he still had to	1191.72	3.959
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	offer support to his customers but	1193.82	3.719
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	eventually he hired people to do this	1195.679	4.561
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	for him and was completely hands off he	1197.539	4.561
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	later went on to sell his business for	1200.24	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	multiple Millions before you start	1202.1	3.6
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	thinking you have to be some kind of	1204.02	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	nerd to create a digital tool hear me	1205.7	4.859
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	out the most important thing to do is to	1208.34	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	identify a problem that needs solving	1210.559	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	often you find people who have the	1212.78	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	ability to code aren't that creative and	1215.059	4.801
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	need a lot of Direction so if you can't	1217.34	4.8
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	code then you can be the ideas person	1219.86	4.98
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the the business brain behind the talent	1222.14	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you then need to pick the customers your	1224.84	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	software is going to serve there are two	1226.7	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	main categories business or consumers	1228.74	4.559
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	serving other businesses is often seen	1231.02	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	as the least risky and you can make more	1233.299	3.841
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	money per customer when you've got this	1235.34	3.6
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you'll really be able to see how people	1237.14	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	respond to your solution you've got to	1238.94	3.96
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	make sure you aren't too attached to	1241.22	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	your ideas as you may find it doesn't	1242.9	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	actually fix the problem you intended	1245.0	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	therefore it's very important to be able	1246.98	4.319
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	to adapt your digital tool after	1249.5	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	receiving criticism even if this isn't	1251.299	3.961
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	something you think you can start right	1253.7	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	now it's worth just noting down problems	1255.26	4.74
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you see businesses are facing just in	1257.6	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	case you stumble upon a solution no one	1260.0	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	has thought of before so how much time	1262.16	4.8
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	does creating a digital tool take I'm	1264.32	4.92
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	going to give this a 5 out of five not	1266.96	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	only does the process of coming up with	1269.24	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the idea take a long time so does the	1270.98	5.1
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	testing and the building of the tool so	1273.5	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	if you decide to go down this route I	1276.08	3.66
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	don't want you to be under any Illusions	1277.94	3.84
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	make sure you don't sink years into	1279.74	4.319
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	building the final told before testing	1281.78	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	it though I've seen way too many people	1284.059	4.081
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	do this and realize they've actually	1286.4	3.6
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	just ended up wasting years of their	1288.14	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	life on something no one wants but like	1290.0	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	I mentioned with my friend if you do	1292.7	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	manage to build an amazing digital tool	1294.5	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	then it will pay you a consistent stream	1296.72	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	of passive income and you'll have the	1298.52	4.68
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	added benefit of being able to sell it	1301.22	4.68
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	for potentially Millions now how much	1303.2	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	money do you need I'm going to give this	1305.9	5.279
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a 3.5 out of five that's making anything	1307.82	5.339
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	like this it's going to cost you a	1311.179	3.841
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	decent amount of money however there are	1313.159	3.841
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	two things you can do to bring down your	1315.02	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	costs firstly you can partner with a	1317.0	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	coda and therefore you won't have to pay	1319.34	4.68
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	for his time but you will have to give	1321.44	4.56
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	away Equity secondly once you've made	1324.02	3.84
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	your first version of your product or	1326.0	4.62
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	MVP if it's good you'll start to get	1327.86	4.92
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	some interest from Angel Investors at	1330.62	3.6
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	this point you have to make the decision	1332.78	3.24
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	to either keep using your own money	1334.22	5.1
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	known as bootstrapping or take on	1336.02	5.039
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	investment in return for giving away	1339.32	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	equity in your business but the big	1341.059	5.161
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	question how easy is it to make a	1343.76	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	hundred dollars per a week this is a one	1346.22	4.439
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	out of five if you manage to build and	1348.2	3.959
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	fund it to a stage where it can be	1350.659	3.181
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	released to the market and where to	1352.159	3.541
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	price your subscription at twenty	1353.84	3.9
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	dollars a month then you'd only need 20	1355.7	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	paying customers and you'll be making a	1357.74	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	hundred dollars a week of course you	1359.9	3.659
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	will have other expenses but these will	1361.82	3.839
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	be limited customer support and software	1363.559	4.381
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	updates it's also likely your charge a	1365.659	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	lot more than twenty dollars a month and	1367.94	4.739
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	have a lot more than 20 customers I must	1369.679	4.86
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	spend at least a thousand dollars a	1372.679	4.141
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	month on digital tools so the money's	1374.539	4.081
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	definitely out there so we've talked	1376.82	3.54
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	about investing in assets and building	1378.62	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	your own but one thing that often gets	1380.36	4.439
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	overlooked is actually making money from	1382.88	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the assets you already own which brings	1384.799	6.061
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	me on to idea 7 rent out your stuff most	1386.96	5.28
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	people don't realize that they're	1390.86	2.88
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	sitting on a gold miner could already	1392.24	3.6
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	own what they need to make some passive	1393.74	4.679
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	income I remember a few years ago one of	1395.84	4.199
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	my friends revealed to me that he was	1398.419	3.841
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	struggling to pay his bills I then	1400.039	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	suggested you rented out his driveway to	1402.26	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	make some passive income he looked at me	1404.539	3.961
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	and laughed but then a few weeks later	1406.58	3.66
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	he texted me back and said it was	1408.5	3.659
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	working amazingly this is because he	1410.24	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	lived near Bromley train station which	1412.159	4.081
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	meant he could charge people 70 dollars	1414.02	3.779
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a week to leave their car on his drive	1416.24	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	when they went to London to work he had	1417.799	4.801
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	capacity for two cars so he was actually	1420.02	4.5
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	able to make a hundred and forty dollars	1422.6	3.959
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a week in an extra passive income I'm	1424.52	3.899
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	aware not everyone has a driveway to	1426.559	3.781
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	rent out but most people have something	1428.419	4.081
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	they could use to make money make a list	1430.34	4.079
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	of everything you own and see if	1432.5	4.26
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	anything jumps out at you a few ideas	1434.419	5.101
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	that come to mind are storage space such	1436.76	5.159
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	as an attic or a basement a vehicle	1439.52	5.46
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	camping equipment camera gear a garage	1441.919	6.061
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	or a spare room in your house or dare I	1444.98	5.1
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	say it money of course you could always	1447.98	3.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	go down the route of buying a second	1450.08	4.2
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	property to rent out but you would need	1451.7	4.32
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a considerable amount of money to do	1454.28	3.48
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	that the world is definitely becoming	1456.02	3.659
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	more familiar with rented things as	1457.76	3.659
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	things are getting more increasingly	1459.679	3.961
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	expensive renting out your stuff can be	1461.419	4.38
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	a great way to actually justify buying	1463.64	4.68
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	the asset in the first place I mean if I	1465.799	4.38
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	knew that an expensive camera will pay	1468.32	3.599
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	for itself after a certain amount of	1470.179	3.841
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	rentals then it makes sense to buy it	1471.919	3.481
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	once you've thought of what you can rent	1474.02	3.36
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	to others all you need to do is find an	1475.4	3.659

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	take a bit of a risk this could be a	1509.659	4.741
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	great option to explore so how much time	1511.76	4.86
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	does renting something out take I'll	1514.4	4.44
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	give this a one out of five because all	1516.62	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	you have to do is take a few pictures	1518.84	3.6

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	biggest drawback of this is the	1524.24	3.539

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	having some kind of insurance is	1531.559	4.261
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	important normally this comes with the	1533.24	5.52

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	this a one out of five because if you're	1540.86	3.78
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	just renting out things you already own	1542.779	4.321
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	it's not going to cost you anything the	1544.64	4.08
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	only cost will be if you decide to get	1547.1	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	separate insurance or you decide you	1548.72	4.199

5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	to make a hundred dollars a week I'd	1555.559	4.561
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	give this a two out of five as it's very	1557.6	4.319
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	easy if you have enough assets to rent	1560.12	3.72
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	out most people have a house they can	1561.919	3.841
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	use to make an extra hundred dollars a	1563.84	4.02
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	week even if that means renting out a	1565.76	4.38
5vZjrxE8Wlc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZjrxE8Wlc	driveway or a spare room if you'd like	1567.86	3.78

cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	Hey folks!!! CA Rachana Ranade	0.0	2.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	here and I welcome you all to the very first video 
of 2023. Animation team is even very much excited	20.28	10.56
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	for 2023 it seems so Happy New Year to everyone 
and today's video is what I mean in today's video	30.84	7.02
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	what are we going to discuss about? We are going 
to try and understand about the thought process of	37.86	4.56
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	FIS. If you know since the beginning of 2021 till 
date FIS have sold stocks worth almost 4 trillion	42.42	9.54
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	rupees. Now we are going to understand what has 
been the scenario before this 2021 sell-off and	51.96	7.32
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	what is their position as on data, okay so we are 
going to compare before and after okay. We are	59.28	6.78
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	going to try and analyze the sectoral allocation 
of FIS so we are going to compare how much is	66.06	5.94
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	the allocation for Nifty 500 versus any specific 
sector and we are going to try and understand how	72.0	5.58
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	much they are overweight or underweight not only 
that, post analyzing the sector we are going to	77.58	6.66
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	try and understand which two stocks could be 
possibly good ones for 2023. So as discussed	84.24	8.4
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	first let's understand the data points till the 
beginning of 2021 and then we will shift to the	92.64	5.58
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	2022 data. So have a look at this chart this 
is the data for as on March 2021 right so this	98.22	7.74
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	is only a quarterly data okay so quarter ended 
March 2021, here if you see first we talk about	105.96	6.24
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	the sector weightage in Nifty five hundred okay, 
now if you see your highest weightage is to whom	112.2	6.99
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	financials, second highest is IT and third highest 
is materials okay. This is what sector weightage	119.19	7.77
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	in Nifty five hundred. Now we are going to compare 
that with FII shareholding in Nifty five hundred	126.96	5.7
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	so basically if they're going above that that 
means they are overweight in that sector. If	132.66	4.32
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	they are going below the Nifty Five hundred 
weightage it means that they are underweight	136.98	4.32
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	on that specific sector as simple as that so 
going back to the financials one as per Nifty	141.3	5.52
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	Five hundred what was the sector weight 31.9 but 
if I said we want to invest more in the financial	146.82	6.3
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	space and that is why they are overweight they 
have given an allocation of 39.5 percent to	153.12	6.72
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	financials okay this is a clear cut over weight. 
Now just to give you another example of overweight	159.84	5.64
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	may not be to such a great extent one more example 
of that could be utilities here you can see from	165.48	6.42
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	3.3 percent which is a Nifty Five hundred weight 
they have given an overweight by three I mean of	171.9	5.94
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	3.7 percent but all other sectors you can see 
barely one percent overweight or something like	177.84	7.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	that but financials is clearly an outperformer 
here right overweight here is almost by seven	184.92	6.66
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	percentage right. Now if I were to understand what 
is the scenario for 2022 here okay if you see here	191.58	7.98
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	in 2022 now the weightage for financials again 
sector weightage of nifty five hundred itself	199.56	6.36
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	is 29% but how about the case with FIS? If FIS 
have still given overweight to financials and	205.92	9.06
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	right now it is at 34.6 percent again right 
now means I had the data point till June 2022	214.98	6.9
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	so this is like q1 of FY 23 but still you can 
see here even though if I'm comparing it with	221.88	6.6
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	other sector be it Energy again understood energy 
is also overweight but by how much by hardly one	228.48	4.92
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	point five percent again if I talk about utilities 
I can see here oh they are increasing in utilities	233.4	4.5
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	a little bit more as compared to 21 data they have 
increased the overweight in utilities but still by	237.9	6.24
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	how much by 1.3 percent but again clear cut out 
performer is what is financial space so now we	244.14	6.78
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	have to understand why they feel that financials 
could outperform or why are they overweight in the	250.92	7.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	financials that's what we are going to understand 
in the immediate next section of the video.	258.0	3.48
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	Now let's try and understand as to why financials 
could have been one of the favorites of FIS? To	262.2	7.2
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	understand the logic behind it let's try and 
use some interesting analogy for that okay	269.4	3.84
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	have a look at this and I'm sure you might be like 
let me explain one by one okay assume that here we	273.84	7.38
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	have RBI and RBI of course as everyone understands 
is the one who decides how much inflation is to	281.22	7.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	be there in the economy and they do that with 
the help of their monetary policies okay now if	288.3	5.04
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	they bring in more money supply into the economy 
that is called as the quantitative easing what is	293.34	5.82
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	going to happen because of that that will lead to 
overall increase in the interest rates correct as	299.16	6.0
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	interest rates keep on rising, we say yields will 
go rising for bonds and as yields rise bond prices	305.16	7.14
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	are going to fall so always remember there's 
going to be an inverse relationship like the	312.3	4.98
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	Seesaw for yields and bonds and with this Banks 
could have M2M losses for the bonds that they	317.28	8.7
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	might have bought earlier but on the contrary what 
would happen? On the contrary if inflation peaks	325.98	5.94
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	and at one point in time if RBI now wants to focus 
on easing out interest rates because of which now	331.92	7.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	the interest rates are going to shrink the bond 
yields are monitoring and the Seesaw relationship	339.0	5.28
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	is going to maintain inverse relationship will be 
maintained because of which bond prices will rise	344.28	5.4
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	now that bond prices have risen that is going to 
have a nice impact on the bank because banks are	349.68	6.24
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	now going to have increased profitability because 
of basically the M2M profits. What is M2M Mark	355.92	6.54
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	to Market profits with this what will happen 
that EPS will increase now have a look at this	362.46	5.88
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	if EPS increases what is going to happen? If I'm 
talking about the various parameters for valuation	368.34	5.76
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	something like a PE valuation if the denominator 
that is a EPS has only increased now automatically	374.1	6.3
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	their valuation will look comparatively cheaper 
and this is going to be positive for the bank but	380.4	6.96
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	this is what we discussed from the uh from the 
overall perspective of what FIS are thinking?	387.36	4.98
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	What is the thought process of RBI is also equally 
important, what does RBI feel? Does RBI feel that	393.24	6.3
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	inflation is going to ease off or not? For that 
have a look at this chart now here you can see	399.54	5.76
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	that since 2020 till almost 2022 beginning you 
can see that inflation was continuously On The	405.3	8.46
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	Rise but RBI has also forecasted by the way this 
is about RBI's forecast they have forecasted that	413.76	6.72
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	yes inflation seems to be at peak and now they 
feel that inflation might go down and down. You	420.48	6.9
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	can see that Peak Point happened somewhere 
around q1 FY 23 at 7.5% and since then you	427.38	7.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	can see here it is going down and down and down 
and if you see the red dotted line which is about	434.46	4.62
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	the RBI's projection somewhere around q1fy24 
they are expecting the inflation to cool off at	439.08	6.42
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	around 5 percent. Now have we understood about 
the stance of FIS? yesss. Have you understood	445.5	6.84
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	about the projections of RBI? Yesss. Now what? I 
hope you have understood which sector is going to	452.34	5.64
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	analysis of this bank let me first of all 
warn you that this is a small cap. It's	467.252	5.04
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	market capitalization is barely 4,780 crores so 
the moment we are saying that it's a small cap it	472.292	6.54
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	means that it comes with a high risk category and 
if I'm talking about a high risk there are also	478.832	6.18
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	potential high returns but could that be possible 
for that let's have a look at some basic pointers	485.012	5.28
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	of Karnataka Bank. First of all you need to know 
that this is a bank which has a good banking	490.292	4.2
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	experience of over nine decades, it has a network 
of almost 877 branches it's spread across 22	494.492	7.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	States and two union territories, if I have a look 
at the financial highlights of this Bank, have a	501.572	5.76
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	look at this the total net advances for this bank 
has been increasing continuously whatever you can	507.332	5.1
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	see are rupees in crores by the way it has been 
increasing so is the case with net profit that is	512.432	5.7
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	also in an increasing trend, if you have a look 
at the deposits that these are also increasing,	518.132	4.8
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	if you have a look at CASA. Now what is CASA? 
Current account Saving account that is also	522.932	4.92
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	increasing, see if that increases again the cost 
of funding for the bank is going to go down which	527.852	5.1
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	will help to push up the profitability further 
and if you have look at the NIM, NIM is what? Net	532.952	4.92
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	Interest Margins, they are also on a rise it was 
at 3.18 percent got cooled off a little bit but it	537.872	7.14
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	has already reached the same level in financial 
year 2022. Now all these points look good to me	545.012	6.54
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	but if I were to come to a very crucial point 
in a banking sector what is that that is about	551.552	4.68
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	NPS right so for that have a look at this if you 
see gross NPAs are at 3.9 percent and if you see	556.232	7.02
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	that has been on a decreasing trend, NPA is always 
it's lower the better so that is on a decreasing	563.252	5.52
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	trend and even if you check the net NPAs that is 
also at the lowest right now if I were to compare	568.772	4.14
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	2018 onwards so that is also decreasing but is 
2.42 in itself a comparatively bigger number. Is	572.912	7.56
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	there any other number that we should look at 
we are going to discuss about that but before	580.472	3.9
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	that let me complete two more ratios as well. 
If you see here return on assets has shot up in	584.372	4.98
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	the last quarter of q2 FY 23 to 1.10 percent and 
even ROE has shot up to 14.36 percent that's again	589.352	8.64
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	that sharp rise in is in the q2 FY23, what does 
this mean? Returns are increasing that is maybe	597.992	8.04
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	the bottom line is increasing and for that we 
also have to try and understand the relationship	606.032	4.98
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	between how profitability can increase versus 
what is the scenario with their bad debts	611.012	6.72
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	that is the NPAs Non-performing Assets. Now for 
that we were trying to look into the management	617.732	5.34
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	commentary Mr Mahabaleshwara, he has mentioned in 
his management commentary I'm just going to focus	623.072	5.4
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	on the key points he says that we are increasing 
the provisions and the PCR if you look at the	628.472	6.0
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	various segments, we have not yet looked at the 
various segments but what is he saying we are	634.472	3.96
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	increasing the provisions and we are increasing 
the PCR. Here he is saying very clearly that we	638.432	5.22
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	we have already increased the PCR to around 80 
percent provision coverage ratio is already at	643.652	6.0
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	80 percent and in the line below that he's saying 
that we are able to sustain we feel that we should	649.652	4.86
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	be able to sustain this PCR at around 80 percent 
so okay I'm comfortable with the fact that PCR	654.512	6.72
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	is at 80%. What about the provisions? Here you 
can see, what about the overall coverage I mean	661.232	5.7
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	93 percent security coverage is there for our NPA 
portfolio is what he says. Now for those who did	666.932	7.74
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	not understand even one percent of this entire 
management commentary let me try and simplify	674.672	4.38
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	this for you okay what is he saying 93 security 
coverage is therefore are NPAs means what? Assume	679.052	5.94
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	that they are given a loan of 100 rupees okay and 
it went bad for that they have an asset backing of	684.992	6.66
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	93 rupees correct so for every 100 rupees loan 
they can easily recover 93 rupees because that	691.652	6.12
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	is the backing that they have that is what is the 
security coverage that they have. Now the problem	697.772	5.28
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	is about that seven rupees effectively that is 
like lost money for them that is exactly what the	703.052	7.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	I mean that is what exactly PCR caters to are 
they able to have good provisions for that for	710.132	6.36
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	this seven rupees which is actually going to go 
bust okay so for that what are they saying they	716.492	5.4
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	have PCR around 80 percent but wait 80 percent is 
not of 7 rupees, eighty percent is of 100 rupees	721.892	8.46
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	of loan given so now you can imagine for every 100 
rupees of loan given they have 93 rupees Security	730.352	6.6
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	Plus they have 80 percent PCR. 80 percent of not 
seven eighty percent of entire 100 so that takes	736.952	8.04
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	the entire provisioning scenario plus security 
scenario 270 percent plus so for every 100 rupees	744.992	7.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	loan given they have a security of almost 170. 
Does that sound good? Does that sound comfortable?	752.072	5.82
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	Obviously yes. Now for that we have to also 
understand about one more chart as to where is	757.892	5.28
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	the exposure to which sectors is there in exposure 
and how much is secured loan and how much is	763.172	6.9
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	unsecured? For that have a look at this chart 
if you see overall worst case scenario is with	770.072	5.88
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	NBFC is where secured is almost zero but best case 
scenario is with large Enterprises where secured	775.952	6.24
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	portfolio is almost 100% but have a look at the 
green line in a horizontal direction you can see	782.192	5.88
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	that overall secured is around 90 percent just 
one dip again in the other segment where it is	788.072	6.96
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	a shared below 80 percent right so 93 percent that 
we were talking about in the management commentary	795.032	5.28
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	can also be seen in this specific line as well 
how about the PCR? PCR you can see those purple	800.312	6.66
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	lines PCR is almost 100% for NBFC even if you see 
Large Enterprises, Infra or others it is as high	806.972	7.62
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	as almost hundred percent, but let's have a look 
at the average figures also if if you have a look	814.592	5.64
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	at Agri, MSME, Housing and whatnot. The overall 
60 criteria seems to be the overall scenario.	820.232	7.62
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	what is the scenario all in all? Okay majority 
cases the loans are secured to ninety percent	828.512	6.3
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	plus is one scenario. Now we looked at all the 
sectors also number two even if we talked about	834.812	4.98
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	PCR average was 60% okay but sixty percent is 
still good why? Out of 100,90 secured and again	839.792	7.98
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	on 100 they are doing a provisioning of almost 60 
percent plus so am I comfortable? Answer is yes.	847.772	7.32
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	One more point we look at even if you are talking 
about the NPA scenario, we will see where does the	855.812	5.22
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	NPA come from? For that have a look at this pie 
chart, you can see that up in the retail segment	861.032	5.22
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	the NPA is having a major sorry in overall NPA 
retail has a major chunk of almost 75 percent.	866.252	8.16
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	Now what do we mean by retail loans? They have 
said that retailers where we are giving a loan	874.412	4.5
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	up to 7.5 crores okay. Mid corporates is almost 
25 percent, large corporates is hardly any chunk,	878.912	8.34
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	now just as overall my experience says is that 
it's not that difficult to recover money from	887.252	7.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	retail individual investors so recoverability 
can be good on top of that they have security,	894.332	4.98
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	on top of that they have good provisioning and 
with that once money is being recovered can I say	899.312	6.84
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	provisions will be written back or with more and 
more money flowing in can I say that profitability	906.152	6.36
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	is going to increase? Answer is obviously Yes. 
If that be so RFI is increasing the stake in	912.512	7.38
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	these companies or not? For that have a look 
at this September 2020 FIS holding in Karnataka	919.892	6.06
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	Bank was 7.33%. September 21 they increased it 
to 9.1 percent and any guesses for September	925.952	7.26
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	2022 they have increased their shareholding to 
18.15 percent it's almost double in one year,	933.212	7.56
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	so if they are so much bullish I hope by now 
you have understood the overall logic of the	941.312	6.12
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	increasing their stake in Karnataka bank I want 
you all to tell me in the comment section what	947.432	5.1
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	are your thoughts about Karnataka Bank? what is 
what is one positive point? one negative point	952.532	4.02
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	that you feel about Karnataka bank? Now let's 
go on with the Second Bank as I mentioned One	956.552	5.22
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	Bank we took from the public sector space, now we 
are going to talk about a bank which is from the	961.772	4.14
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	private sector space and the name of the bank 
is Federal Bank Limited. Let's understand some	965.912	5.22
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	basic points about this bank it's an Indian 
private sector bank, headquartered in Kochi	971.132	3.72
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	that is in Kerala. If we have a look at some 
basic data points for this Bank you can see	974.852	4.98
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	here that their Gross NPA has always been below 
the industry average and right now it's almost	979.832	5.58
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	at the lowest point at 2.8 percent. Even if you 
have a look at their NPA chart, here you can also	985.412	4.8
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	see that here again they are below the industry 
average and latest data point it is at the lowest	990.212	5.1
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	at 0.96 percent. Now if we have a look at their 
overall business growth you can see here that	995.312	5.94
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	advances are also increasing, the deposits are 
also increasing but one interesting point here	1001.252	4.68
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	is that their percentage share in the advances 
market has been at the highest point right now at	1005.932	6.66
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	one point to one percent I know one point to one 
percent in a figure itself is not big at all but	1012.592	5.82
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	for the bank to move up from 1.06 percent in FY 
18 to 1.21 percent in FY 22 is encouraging right.	1018.412	8.4
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	If we move on to the PCR numbers now you can see 
here that their PCR has has been again increasing	1026.812	5.88
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	constantly from 43.47 percent in FY18 to 65.54% in 
FY22 also I would want to tell you that as per the	1032.692	9.84
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	latest quarterly data available that is q2 FY23 
their PCR has further gone up to 67 percent. Now	1042.532	7.62
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	if we have a look at the net interest margins, 
you can see here that NIMs were at peak at 3.21	1050.152	5.94
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	percent in FY 18, they started to cool off and in 
FY 22 it has almost regained the point of 3.2 but	1056.092	7.74
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	3.20 round off but there is an important update 
here as per the latest quarterly data available	1063.832	5.52
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	q2 fy23 their net interest margin has climbed up 
to 3.3 percent okay moving ahead with CASA again	1069.352	8.1
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	you can see that CASA has been increasing from 
33 percent. I took a dip but now is back to the	1077.452	5.94
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	highest point it is at 36.94 right now. If you 
have a look at some of the ratios about their	1083.392	7.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	returns, return on assets is at the highest point 
right now at one point two one percent, return on	1090.472	5.22
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	equity is also at the highest point right now 
at 14.36 percent. Now if we have with with all	1095.692	5.88
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	these basic points right now if we have a look at 
the valuations if I were to compare it with other	1101.572	5.16
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	private sector banks of course ideally I should 
not be comparing it with something like an HDFC	1106.732	5.64
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	which has a Price to Book value of 3.60 nor with 
an ICICI with a P to BV of 3.46 because they are	1112.372	7.8
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	very biggest compared to a Federal Bank but even 
if I talk about some mid-size or small size,	1120.172	4.44
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	have a look at this Kotak is at 3.70, Axis is at 
2.40 both are still bigger ones. Indusind at 1.99,	1124.612	7.74
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	YES Bank is also at 1.66 but Federal Bank is 
available at 1.53 right now. So the point that	1132.352	6.66
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	I was trying to tell you that we are focusing here 
on those banks which are comparatively undervalued	1139.012	6.3
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	and that is why I thought of showing this number 
to you. Going on to the last point right now if	1145.312	4.08
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	you have a look at the shareholding pattern 
of FIS. You can see here that fi shareholding	1149.392	4.5
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	used to be in the 30s in late 19 or early 20s it 
dipped a little bit December 2020 here you can	1153.892	7.56
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	see it went down to 21.69 percent but from there 
the FIS have started to increase their share and	1161.452	6.9
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	right now it is at 26.40 percent all in all even 
if you search for yourself since 2018 till date	1168.352	7.2
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	the FIS percentage only has never dropped below 20 
percent and this figure of 26.40 in itself quite a	1175.552	7.92
cNOTS_hnMdI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNOTS_hnMdI	big number. Well I hope you understood and enjoyed 
the fundamental analysis of both these talks but	1183.472	5.04

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that bull run is there then it will move	375.12	4.079
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	something like this as any crashing yoga	377.52	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	crash will be there every once in a	379.199	3.241
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	while right it might happen like this it	381.0	3.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	might go like this but generally you are	382.44	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	on an upward moving trajectory so if you	384.12	4.019
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are buying majority of your stuff here	386.4	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	or if you have already purchased it here	388.139	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	or here and if you write through this	390.0	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	entire bull run which might last for two	392.039	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	three years or maybe one year no one	393.9	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	knows then only you are going to make	395.759	3.961
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	money as a retail investor there are	397.5	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	just literally two ways that you will	399.72	3.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	make money as a retail investor first	401.1	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	option is that you buy cheap for example	402.84	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	uh the initial graphic that I showed you	404.94	5.16
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that I had purchased nifty 50 at 16 400	407.039	4.621
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	levels according to me that was cheap	410.1	3.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right that was inexpensive at that time	411.66	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	so I had done bulk investing there	413.52	4.92
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that's option one yeah second option is	415.38	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that you ride through the bull so so	418.44	2.759
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that's it that's how you're going to	419.94	2.879
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	make money otherwise you will have to do	421.199	3.181
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	fno sometimes you'll make money	422.819	3.061
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sometimes you'll lose crazy amount of	424.38	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	money and net net as per studies it has	425.88	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	been pointed out that fno Traders do not	428.46	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	make much money so I hope 0.1 is clear	430.56	3.479
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	let's move to 0.2 now the second key	432.36	3.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	point that you need to remember is that	434.039	4.261
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	please stop panicking this deliberate	435.78	4.319
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Panic that is created in the stock	438.3	5.339
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	market on good stocks then they fall big	440.099	6.181
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	investors buy them and then retail	443.639	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	investors sell them and then the stock	446.28	4.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	runs and then they start thinking	448.319	4.861
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	okay so let me illustrate that story by	450.38	4.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	talking about the example of page	453.18	4.019
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Industries so after the Friday session	454.74	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	I'm shooting this video on Saturday so	457.199	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	on the Friday session page industry	459.36	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	stock fell by 15 right and now you will	461.039	5.78
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	be thinking	464.46	5.28
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	and it has fallen to like 52 weeks low	466.819	6.88
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	on poor Q4 show so what exactly has	469.74	6.239
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	happened with paid industry and what is	473.699	4.201
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the meaning of poor Q4 show so let me	475.979	3.541
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	first and foremost take you to page in	477.9	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	industry fundamental so to say and	479.52	3.78
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	illustrate the point see if you take a	481.44	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	look at ERI sales right then it is	483.3	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sitting on highest ever sales it is	485.28	3.0
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sitting on highest ever profits so	486.84	3.359
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	earwise sales if you aggregate it no	488.28	3.539
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	problem but if you take a look at	490.199	3.361
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	quarter wise sales right so for example	491.819	4.621
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	March 2020 three quarter if you compare	493.56	6.06
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to Mars 2022 quarter you will see that	496.44	5.4
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the revenues have shrunk by roughly 15	499.62	4.799
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	20 and resultantly the profits have also	501.84	5.039
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	shrunk quite a bit now if you understand	504.419	4.141
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the point that as to why this is	506.879	3.361
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	happening and what is the reason for	508.56	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that then that 15 fall becomes a great	510.24	4.739
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	opportunity for you to buy otherwise if	512.52	4.019
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are we have recently purchased like	514.979	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	page Industries 15 fall you will go	516.539	5.401
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	crazy right okay so let me first and	518.82	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	foremost explain that what has happened	521.94	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	at page Industries I will give you my	523.5	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	very quick Viewpoint there and then you	525.54	2.94
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	can make a call whether it makes sense	527.04	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to buy these type of stocks or not so	528.48	3.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	okay so last year you would have heard	530.22	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that many companies have had input cost	531.6	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	pressure so what is the meaning of input	533.76	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cost pressure that raw material prices	535.26	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	have gone up coal prices have gone up	537.36	3.479
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	steel price have gone up construction	538.98	4.14
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	material prices have gone up similarly	540.839	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	what is the raw material for something	543.12	3.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	like page industry so they make like	544.68	3.98
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	undergarments	546.54	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right so so cotton becomes one of the	548.66	4.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	primary drivers of cost so if you take a	551.16	4.679
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	look at the Cotton prices last year it	553.38	4.76
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	went from what levels from approximately	555.839	6.241
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	7.7 US dollar all the way to two dollars	558.14	6.759
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right so almost three times price rise	562.08	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	in Cotton right so that's one so if you	564.899	4.021
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	take a look at cotton prices after covet	566.64	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you will see that it was roughly at like	568.92	5.4
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	0.5.6 and then it went all the way to	571.08	6.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	1.4 1.5 so at least double the way right	574.32	5.04
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	in within a one year it almost doubled	577.5	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	so this is massive pressure in terms of	579.36	4.8
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cost now what has started to happen well	581.94	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the prices have started to come down for	584.16	5.16
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cotton to its reasonable levels that is	586.5	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the most important point now use your	589.32	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	brain and think about the fact that if	591.0	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are a company like page Industries	593.04	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will you manufacture more at a time when	594.54	4.859
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cotton prices are here here or here the	596.94	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the short answer is no that you are	599.399	4.141
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	unlikely to do that why because your	601.56	5.16
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	variable cost variable cost will go up	603.54	5.82
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	so your profits are anyways going to get	606.72	4.559
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	crushed if you are manufacturing more	609.36	3.659
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	and more right you will not be able to	611.279	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	increase your product prices at such a	613.019	4.621
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	massive scale at which the cotton prices	615.12	4.26
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are going up so what page industry	617.64	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	decided to do was that they just decided	619.38	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to wait they said that you know what	621.3	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that let's say that in 2020 when the	623.04	5.04
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	prices were reasonable we manufactured	625.98	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	like thousand units of our product in	628.08	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	2021 we again manufactured 1000 units	630.18	5.64
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right our usual capacity in 2022 because	632.76	6.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the cotton prices are more right so that	635.82	6.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	is what they decided to do 2023 if the	639.12	5.399
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cotton prices have come back down they	642.3	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are again going to manufacture 1000	644.519	3.781
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	units what was happening was that this	646.26	4.139
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	was leading to pent-up inventory they	648.3	3.779
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	did not create a new inventory to begin	650.399	3.721
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	with if they do not have new inventory	652.079	3.421
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to begin with how are they going to	654.12	3.06
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	execute that in terms of more sales	655.5	3.839
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that's Party part B the good thing that	657.18	4.099
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	industry did was that they did not say	659.339	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	inventory we are going to sell it at a	661.279	5.021
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	loss no they did not do that that was a	663.899	4.201
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	problem that consumer durable companies	666.3	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	faced for example Whirlpool if it	668.1	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	manufactures a washing machine and if	670.14	4.98
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that is being kept with a retailer that	671.82	5.04
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	machine is losing value because	675.12	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	electronic products can get damaged on	676.86	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	top of that storage of a washing machine	679.44	5.579
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	is fairly big space right so all those	681.48	4.859
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	problems are there with consumer	685.019	3.661
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	durables which was not necessarily there	686.339	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	for a company like page industry So Paid	688.68	3.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	industry simply said	690.779	3.601
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right so we are not going to manufacture	692.24	3.64
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that much to begin with	694.38	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that will slow down the sales right that	695.88	3.78
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	does not mean that they are cutting	698.579	3.781
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	inventory at a loss and that also in a	699.66	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	way directly means that next step their	702.36	3.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	manufacturing is going to go up this is	703.98	3.539
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	going to get reflected in numbers so	705.72	3.359
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that is my understanding now of course	707.519	2.88
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you can have a separate viewpointing	709.079	3.561
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	company	710.399	2.241
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	40 50 profit is gone down so that	713.0	5.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	company is gone forever people are going	716.399	3.661
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to stop wearing underwears and whatnot	718.44	3.899
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that is your Viewpoint so you please	720.06	5.219
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	make a call now you'll say if a company	722.339	6.24

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	it see what is likely going to happen	817.019	3.901
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	from this point is and this is the nifty	818.94	3.78
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	50 chart right so this is one of the	820.92	4.02
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	safest things that you can buy now we	822.72	4.619
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are here right we are almost at all-time	824.94	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	high so nifty 50 overall is at an	827.339	4.74
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	all-time high when I had been purchasing	830.04	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	nifty 50 somewhere here right here then	832.079	3.781
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	people were saying that you know RW or	834.36	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	giriga Market is that then people did	835.86	2.94
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	not purchase it when the previous	837.54	3.479
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	history of I was here right so people	838.8	4.26
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	did not buy it now people are saying	841.019	3.721
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that you know what let us buy nifty 50	843.06	3.779
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	here in bulk it might be a good decision	844.74	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	if what happens that if there is a very	846.839	4.021
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	clear breakout so this is the breakout	849.24	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	line right so 18 800 is the previous	850.86	5.279
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	iPhone ft if the Nifty breaks like this	853.32	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	it falls it breaks it it again Falls	856.139	3.901
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	like this and it will it will move like	858.42	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	this right or it could move like this so	860.04	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	this might be a great strategy that if	862.38	4.019
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are buying doing bulk buying above	864.42	4.919
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	18 800 levels because now you have a	866.399	5.641
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	very clear indicator gets a nifty 50 is	869.339	5.581
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	in a very clear Bull Run and 18 800	872.04	4.739
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	level has been decisive heavily broken	874.92	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	with volume if you are doing bulk buying	876.779	4.261
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	then then it makes sense to buy Nifty	879.24	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	50. otherwise what can happen and let me	881.04	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	clear it out and draw it again otherwise	883.44	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	what can happen is let's see it will	885.36	3.779
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	rise like this it will fall it will rise	887.04	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	like this it will fall you are holding	889.139	3.301
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	nifty 50 only know so if you have	890.94	3.839
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	purchase nifty 50 here then again after	892.44	4.019
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	six months you have made like literally	894.779	4.081
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	zero Returns on Nifty 50. I hope you got	896.459	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	this complicated Point again humble	898.86	3.419
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	requests that if you do like these type	900.839	3.421
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	of tip strategies do press a like button	902.279	3.901
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	it helps the video a lot and I keep on	904.26	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	giving more insightful macro commentary	906.18	3.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	whatever I'm doing in the market I keep	907.98	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	on outlining that quite in detail on	909.899	4.261
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	member community so do check it out so	911.94	3.899
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	see this is the problem in terms of	914.16	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	buying a good asset like nifty 50 when	915.839	5.761
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the valuations are almost at its peak	918.54	5.099
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	but what you can do is that you can buy	921.6	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	some heavy weights if they are good but	923.639	3.961
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	they are trading at a discount so let me	925.8	3.779
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	give you the example of Asian paints	927.6	3.299
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right now so you can see that it is	929.579	3.661
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	trading at roughly 3100 and even if it	930.899	3.961
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	goes back to its previous Peak there is	933.24	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	a good 16 17 18 gain which is to be	934.86	5.159
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	pocketed now two things can happen one	937.92	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	is that we keep on hovering in the range	940.019	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	17 800 all the way to let's say nineteen	941.76	5.699
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	thousand right so if you buy nifty fifty	944.699	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	now you're not going to make much return	947.459	3.24
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are going to make approximately zero	949.079	4.081
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	percent return second thing is that the	950.699	4.801
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	nifty 50 gives a massive breakout above	953.16	4.979
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	18 800 and we start trading in that	955.5	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	range of roughly twenty one thousand	958.139	3.121
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right so this is the range that we trade	959.699	3.601
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	in so from this you are going to make	961.26	5.04
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Returns on nifty 50 also right which you	963.3	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	might be lucky if you buy it at high	966.3	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	valuations and still get returns and	967.8	3.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	second thing is that these type of	969.48	3.299
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	stocks for example Asian paints which	970.92	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are heavyweights and Nifty they have to	972.779	5.101
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	move in order for Nifty to go to 21 000	975.0	5.579
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	and even if Nifty keeps on dancing in	977.88	4.079
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	this range then also very high	980.579	4.081
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	likelihood that Asian paints is going to	981.959	5.101
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	move up might go down move up and all	984.66	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that stuff so you might get an	987.06	3.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	opportunity to exit the stock in case	988.62	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you don't feel comfortable now all this	990.779	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	needs to be seen in correlation to the	993.12	4.86
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	fundamentals recently Asian paints	995.399	4.981
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	announced the result and it was these	997.98	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	results were magnificent right so	1000.38	3.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	everyone agreed to the fact that you	1002.06	2.88
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	know what Asian paints is doing	1003.74	2.76
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	wonderfully well so you can check this	1004.94	3.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	also so just quickly go and check here	1006.5	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	and you will see that you're not highest	1008.36	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	ever sales highest ever profits even if	1009.68	3.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	if you go quarter wise right forget	1011.54	3.419
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	about everything else even if you go	1013.04	3.359
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	quarter wise then also they are doing	1014.959	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	fine right March 2022 sales was how much	1016.399	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	seven eight nine three here it is eight	1018.8	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	seven eight seven so the point is that	1021.019	4.021
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the company is doing fabulously well	1023.3	4.74

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	page Industries so why is it that Asian	1030.38	4.02
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	paints going forward is not going to go	1032.6	3.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to its highest ever prices right in	1034.4	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	terms of stock it might take a year	1036.319	3.721
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	there might be Panic that can be created	1038.12	4.199

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	this graphic and this shows the returns	1066.74	4.74
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that have been given by small cap and	1069.14	6.0
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	index and in a bull market whenever for	1071.48	5.46
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	example bull market would be that in	1075.14	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	2003 we had a bull market sensex gave	1076.94	4.64
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sensex	1079.34	6.06
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that 91.5 return here and small cap gave	1081.58	6.219
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	almost double the returns similarly 2007	1085.4	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	there was a bull run and here again	1087.799	4.141
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	small cap outperformed 2009 again bull	1089.36	6.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	run small cap outperformed by a lot 2012	1091.94	5.58
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	bull run again outperformed here again	1095.48	4.02
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	outperformed the point I'm trying to	1097.52	4.26
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	drive home is that small caps outperform	1099.5	5.64
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	nifty 50 sensex in a bull run if you	1101.78	5.639
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	feel that we are in a bull run or we are	1105.14	3.659
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	close to a bull run or Bull Run has just	1107.419	3.721
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	started then it might make a lot more	1108.799	4.26
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sense to purchase some small cap	1111.14	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	exposure if you are okay with the risk	1113.059	3.961
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	what is the easiest way to do it just	1115.1	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	simply go on any mutual fund buy small	1117.02	4.8
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cap 250 right don't buy small cap 100	1119.299	5.101
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	and let me also show you very quickly on	1121.82	4.8
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the technical chart here so let me show	1124.4	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you first nifty fifty so nifty fifty you	1126.62	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will see that it is almost at its	1128.6	3.3
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	all-time high what about medical app	1130.1	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	index so you will see that midica app	1131.9	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	has actually broken it's 52 weeks high	1133.94	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	so that has also given return but what	1136.1	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	about small cap so let us quickly go to	1137.9	4.139
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	small cap 100 and you will see that we	1139.64	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are still trading 21 from its speed	1142.039	4.561
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	large caps have given a run up midi caps	1143.96	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	have given an up if we are in a bull run	1146.6	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	why is it that small cap is not going to	1148.4	3.12
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	give a run up when you have the entire	1150.08	3.54
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	previous history that small caps	1151.52	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	outperform midi caps and large gaps in a	1153.62	4.26
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	bull run so from that perspective I	1155.84	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	think it makes a lot more sense to have	1157.88	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	small caps you can take individual	1159.74	4.86
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	positions also but for that you need to	1161.96	4.14
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	have courage if you don't have courage	1164.6	3.24
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	then please do not invest for example	1166.1	4.14
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	some small cap Medicap companies like	1167.84	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	avas financials they have fallen by 50	1170.24	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	something like Tarzan's has fallen grind	1172.28	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	well Norton has fallen so all these are	1174.86	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	good good stocks Kaya has fallen so all	1176.66	3.78
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	these stocks according to me are good	1178.7	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	again not an investment advice please	1180.44	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	check with your investment advisors and	1182.66	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	please do your own due diligence I gave	1184.76	3.539
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	detailed commentary please understand	1186.98	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right I mean whenever you are buying any	1188.299	3.361
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	individual stock please please	1190.58	3.18
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	understand why it is falling what type	1191.66	4.16
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	of arguments can be made for against it	1193.76	4.14
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	amritanjan people are getting scared you	1195.82	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	know what purchase	1197.9	5.279
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	small cap has fallen by how much right	1200.26	5.02
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	so if you check this there is a gap of	1203.179	4.441
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	approximately how much 20 21 now if	1205.28	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	amritanjan fell by 25 right and relative	1207.62	4.559
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Benchmark which is Nifty small cap is	1210.38	4.86
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	falling by 20 so as a way the answer is	1212.179	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	no it is not as if that you know	1215.24	3.24
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	something bad has happened but if you do	1216.559	3.24
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	not have the heart then please do not	1218.48	3.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	get into it my simple suggestion is that	1219.799	3.781
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	please pick assets that you are	1221.84	3.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	comfortable picking put some element of	1223.58	3.599
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	risk because this is where money is made	1225.559	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	because this part of your portfolio the	1227.179	4.921
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	small cap one this is likely to grow at	1229.4	5.22
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	50 60 your large cap if you're picking	1232.1	4.319
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	intelligently those will grow at 15 20	1234.62	3.6
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right Asian paints Mass anywhere that	1236.419	3.0
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you're going to make like 100 return	1238.22	2.94
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	over the next two years very good chance	1239.419	3.901
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that you might make 30 40 return on so	1241.16	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Point number five is that it's very	1243.32	3.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	important to rotate your funds now what	1244.88	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	is the meaning of rotation in funds it	1247.039	3.541
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	simply means that see some Industries	1248.72	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	are up in a certain type of market then	1250.58	5.28
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	they have brought down so it's important	1253.82	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to understand where growth is unlikely	1255.86	4.8
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to happen right I'm not saying 100 Yogi	1258.5	3.9
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	but very unlikely that growth is going	1260.66	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to come or any massive return is going	1262.4	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	to be made so for example according to	1264.5	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	me those are commodity stocks	1266.48	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Commodities stock do really well in a	1267.98	4.74
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	high inflation environment they do	1270.86	3.42
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	really well when there is some kind of	1272.72	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	trouble going on and they have a very	1274.28	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	long cycle so if you are into Metals if	1276.2	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are into cold if you are into	1278.84	3.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	infrastructure building firms you are	1280.4	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	going to struggle right so my simple	1282.559	3.301
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	suggestion is that move away from	1284.12	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	infrastructure and all this stuff rotate	1285.86	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	your money to something like Finance if	1287.96	3.24
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	you are a long-term investor two three	1289.82	2.719
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	years you are going to make good money	1291.2	3.78
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	rotate your overall Capital into	1292.539	3.88
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	manufacturing right so that is still	1294.98	2.76
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	better right compared to something like	1296.419	2.821
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	infrastructure development check	1297.74	3.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	consumer durables right so consumer	1299.24	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	durables are still trading at 30 35	1301.1	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	discount from their Peak why I gave you	1303.08	4.68
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the reason when I explained you the page	1306.2	3.66
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	industry story so from that perspective	1307.76	4.88
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	if you apply that same logic	1309.86	5.04
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	they had to sell their inventory at a	1312.64	5.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	loss last 12 18 months result would be	1314.9	4.56
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	bad in fact maybe this quarter might	1317.96	3.599
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	also be bad but go and check right go	1319.46	3.959
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	literally go and check the price of a	1321.559	4.86

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that is very easy to track so to say so	1338.179	4.74
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	right and then you tell me that after	1340.6	3.76

mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	Infosys will do it TCS will do it just	1406.34	3.959
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	because TCS has done well over the last	1408.26	5.1
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	20 years does not make any sense why it	1410.299	5.581
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will be able to jump on that new tick	1413.36	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	bandwagon which is being centered around	1415.88	3.72
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	cloud and Ai and is going to do	1417.559	4.081
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	exceptionally well I don't think so	1419.6	4.199
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	there is a very high likelihood that AI	1421.64	4.019
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	or certain tools in AI might be built	1423.799	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that might automate a lot of software	1425.659	4.801
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	development software replication so	1428.179	4.38
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	something like TCS is going to suffer is	1430.46	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	this change going to happen immediately	1432.559	3.36
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the I don't think so that this will take	1433.94	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	time to pan out commercial applications	1435.919	4.441
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will be built so this will take time so	1437.78	4.92
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	meanwhile I just want to swing it I will	1440.36	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	sell it off when exactly I will cut my	1442.7	4.2
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	positions I will inform but my viewpoint	1444.86	3.84
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	on it is very simple that it is a highly	1446.9	3.3
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	uncertain space right now it is going	1448.7	4.32
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	through a lot of innovation so to say it	1450.2	4.5
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will have to revamp its business model	1453.02	3.48
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	some new companies all together might	1454.7	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	replace TCS I'm not too bullish on that	1456.5	3.96
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the only reason why I had built my	1458.78	4.08
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	position on Nifty it collectively is	1460.46	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	that I was getting it at a super	1462.86	4.26
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	inexpensive price so go back to my two	1465.08	3.479
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	previous rules that retail investors	1467.12	3.059
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	will make money if they're buying stuff	1468.559	3.841
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	for cheap second they are going to make	1470.179	4.74
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	money if they stick with the bull run so	1472.4	4.98
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	almost all my money is now invested in	1474.919	4.081
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	the stock market I have to build little	1477.38	3.179
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	bit more positions which I will keep on	1479.0	4.02
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	building but mostly I am invested I am	1480.559	4.62
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	going to stay put in the bull run in	1483.02	4.44
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	majorly discounted stocks that's the	1485.179	4.261
mgjgDE0VePc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjgDE0VePc	intent with which I will be navigating	1487.46	4.02

PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	in today's video I am going to discuss	2.159	4.261
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	with you five stocks now these stocks	3.84	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	have fallen quite aggressively from	6.42	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their Peak these are very volatile	8.04	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stocks Point number three that the	9.78	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	entire Market is divided into two camps	11.46	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	one Camp is saying that you know what	13.86	3.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	these stocks have corrected by 50 50 60	15.48	4.92
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so let's go and buy them and they are	17.6	4.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	likely to become multibaggers and we are	20.4	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	getting them at a deeply discounted	22.14	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	prices the second group is saying that	23.58	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you know what these were bigger stocks	25.26	3.0
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would do stocks to begin with therefore	26.82	2.879
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	they fell in the first place so why	28.26	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	touch them so which faction is right I	29.699	4.081
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	am not here to debate that I'm simply	32.099	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	here to present my analysis on these	33.78	4.92
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	five stocks very very quickly so that	36.3	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you get a basic perspective as to what	38.7	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you need to do please do your further	40.68	3.539
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	research on this topic if you need	42.54	3.12

PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	member Community here I speak about	47.34	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	specific moves that I'm making if I'm	49.379	3.721
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	buying certain stocks I will speak about	51.48	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it if I'm selling certain stocks I will	53.1	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	speak about it so this is an entire	55.14	3.059
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	investment community that we have built	56.64	2.939
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	over time and it is getting a lot of	58.199	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	positive feedback so you could consider	59.579	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	joining it now over to the main video so	61.559	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	let me start quickly discussing five key	63.48	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stocks the first key stock that I am	65.46	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	going to speak about is the adani group	67.38	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of stocks now many of you would say that	69.6	3.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you know what akshat	71.7	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you're after advani group no nothing	73.1	4.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	like this the reason why I'm bringing up	75.479	4.561
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adani group of stocks again is fairly	77.76	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	simple because the entire Indian market	80.04	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	right now is revolving around the adani	82.38	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	group when adani group moves up the	84.78	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Indian market moves up and when adani	86.7	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock falls down the Indian market falls	88.68	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	down so in order to understand the	90.42	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Indian market sentiment right now you	92.46	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	have to do a very quick analysis on the	94.32	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adani group of stocks so the first key	96.24	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	point that you need to understand about	98.34	4.139
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the adani group of stock is that these	100.02	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stocks are trading either in Upper	102.479	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	circuit or lower circuit now what is the	104.52	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	meaning of upper and lower circuit for	106.68	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that let me demonstrate an example about	108.78	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adani green Energy company and here what	111.18	4.439
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you would see is that it kept on falling	113.88	4.379
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	in a very linear fashion now if you go	115.619	4.981
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and check its five-day history 3 what	118.259	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you will notice that it is moving in	120.6	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this stepwise format that it was here	122.399	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	then it went up then it's plateaued then	124.68	4.499
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it went up plateaued went up plateaued	127.079	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so whenever you are seeing that	129.179	3.361
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	something is happening in a step format	130.739	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	like this or if something is falling	132.54	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	again in a step format like this this	134.94	5.04
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	means that this is a circuit stock now	137.64	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	how is this important this is something	139.98	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that normal retail investors need to	141.66	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	understand so again let's open the one	143.76	5.46
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	month window for adani green stocks and	146.4	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	what you would notice is that this was	149.22	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	actually consistently in the lower	150.84	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	circuit so this is the depiction of 30	152.7	4.98
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	days right so here there was constant	155.099	4.441
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	lower circuit so let's say that you	157.68	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	bought adani stock somewhere around	159.54	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	let's say 800 levels you thought that	160.98	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you know what coffee correct okay let me	162.84	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	buy it here and you purchased it now	164.76	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	next day when it fell by how much	167.34	3.479
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	percent so every day it kept on falling	169.14	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	by five five percent so next day it fell	170.819	3.721
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	by five percent then next day it fell by	172.5	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	five percent again then it fell by five	174.54	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	percent again now you're sitting on a 15	176.4	4.699
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	loss you're thinking	178.2	5.7
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	I should sell it and move on then what	181.099	4.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would you do you will place the sell	183.9	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	order on the stock but the problem is	185.76	5.22
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that if it is a lower circuit type of a	188.28	5.52
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock the chances are that your stock	190.98	5.7
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will not get a sold this is a very very	193.8	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	important point that you need to	196.68	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	understand just quickly recapping what	198.18	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you need to remember is let's see if you	200.58	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would have purchased it at 800 and the	202.5	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock fell to 700 also and you thought	204.42	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that okay now I will exit the stock even	206.519	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	if you want to sell it you might not	208.98	4.86
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	find counter buyers so this frequently	211.2	5.28
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happens in a circuit stock now what is	213.84	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happening in the adani group is that the	216.48	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	market sentiments have improved and the	218.22	5.099
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock has started to scale up and now it	220.5	4.799
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is getting into upper circuits so now	223.319	3.301
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	what is going to happen is that let's	225.299	3.061
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	say that you purchase azani group of	226.62	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies here and from tomorrow if	228.36	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	lower circuit comes then again you might	230.22	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	enter the same problem that I was trying	232.5	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to exhibit earlier so this is the first	234.299	3.241
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	key point that you need to understand	236.34	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that many of adani group stocks are	237.54	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	existing in a lower or upper circuit and	240.299	4.561
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	if you as a retail investor try to touch	242.64	4.26

PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	message and I'm getting a lot of	249.84	2.34
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	questions that you know what	251.34	2.759
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	fundamentals of adani group has it	252.18	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	become better has it not become better	254.099	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	see I don't know and neither I am going	255.78	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to comment but a thing that I know for	258.0	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	sure is that adani group of companies	260.1	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are family owned family operated and	261.959	4.501
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	family controlled group of companies	264.66	3.539
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is not me saying this is a	266.46	3.299
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	shareholding pattern that you can take a	268.199	3.241
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	look at again I will put the chart	269.759	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	somewhere here and you yourself will be	271.44	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	able to make out that Nani group of	273.3	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stocks are family owned operated there	275.04	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is a separate video that I had done if	276.9	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you want more fundamental understanding	278.46	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	about the group please go and watch that	280.02	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	I will put the links in the description	281.94	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	box now knowing this fact is very very	283.44	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	important now why is that the case let	286.02	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	me explain that by using a simple	287.88	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	example so let's say that you're very	289.32	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	bullish about adani ports you think that	291.18	3.239
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you know what fundamentally it is good	293.16	2.94
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is that analysis I have done now I	294.419	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	want to buy adani ports yes you go and	296.1	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	buy it and maybe it's starts running	298.62	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	also but what is the guarantee that	300.36	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whatever profits the adani ports is	302.4	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	making it will one way or the other	304.62	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	might not get diverted to adani Green so	306.479	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is the precise problem that happens	308.88	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	in conglomerate stocks so you need to be	310.44	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	aware of that that debt can be inter	312.72	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	transferred the profits can be inter	314.4	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	transferred a lot of funny accounting	316.08	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stuff can happen now I am not trying to	318.12	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	portray the fact that you should buy an	320.1	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	order by adani group of companies that	321.6	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is very well your wish whatever you	323.22	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would like to do I frequently get a	324.9	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	question that at what levels will I buy	326.82	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adani group so the answer is at no	328.38	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	levels I'll be buying a tiny group why	329.88	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	because I might be doing analysis for	331.74	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this then how can I be sure that the	333.9	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	money will not get diverted to this so	335.82	3.599
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	for that particular perspective I will	337.8	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stay away from the anani group now comes	339.419	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the third and final point and it is a	341.1	3.539
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very very important fundamental point	342.96	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	which has to do with the interest rate	344.639	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you might have recently read the news	346.56	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that RBI is planning to hike the	348.6	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	interest rates by 25 basis points	350.94	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	similarly the U.S feds are planning to	353.1	4.319
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	increase the interest rate now why am I	355.38	3.539
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	bringing this up am I trying to scare	357.419	3.241
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you about the interest trade scenario in	358.919	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the world the short answer is no I'm not	360.66	3.599
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	trying to create fear-mongering what I'm	362.34	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	simply trying to tell you is that right	364.259	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	now the interest rates have already gone	365.82	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	up and they are still in the process of	367.68	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	going up one day these will Plateau and	369.6	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	then they will start falling but in this	371.639	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	entire Zone here when the interest rates	373.5	4.8
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are going up or will remain high what	375.539	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	type of companies will suffer the most	378.3	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so you guessed it right that companies	379.979	4.141
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that have very high debt are going to	381.96	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	suffer the most now I'll say that okay	384.12	3.359
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you keep on saying every time that Irani	385.62	3.299
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	group hide at company can you talk about	387.479	3.241
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	some other company yes I can definitely	388.919	3.481
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	talk about some other company and that	390.72	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company is called as vedanta group and	392.4	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it is somewhat struggling with this same	394.38	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	interest rate issue what is that issue	396.419	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it is the fact that they are unable to	398.46	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	refinance their debt or external	400.38	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	investors are saying that you know what	402.84	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	within the group you have so much debt	404.28	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	lying on your head and where will you	406.02	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	get the funding from and even if you are	408.06	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	able to do it you will be spending crazy	409.8	3.899
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	amount of money just repaying the	411.66	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	interest that you have taken from the	413.699	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	market again the story lies here that	415.44	3.599
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the interest rates right now are very	417.479	3.361
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very high again here is a chart for you	419.039	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you can check that how high the interest	420.84	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	rates currently are and it might very	422.639	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	well be the case that for the next one	424.86	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and a half two years companies like	426.479	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adani and vedanta which are very high	428.22	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	debt companies they are going to suffer	430.259	4.141
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a lot so back to adani group that will I	432.36	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	be buying adani group the short answer	434.4	3.299
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is no again please feel free to do	435.78	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whatever you feel like but please	437.699	2.761
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	explain your rational I would love to	438.96	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	hear contrary commentary and again the	440.46	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	type of investment community that we are	442.62	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	building everyone would appreciate each	444.36	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	other's Viewpoint the idea here is not	446.039	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to fight with each other but to present	447.66	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	contrary opinions so that everyone can	449.58	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	learn and form their own mind as to	451.86	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whatever they should invest their money	453.66	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	on so with that said let us move to	455.4	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock number two and let me detail out	457.08	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the conversation around the vedanta	458.94	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	group so first things first people who	460.86	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are not familiar with the vedanta group	462.84	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	let me quickly explain the business	464.46	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	model first they were the mining Barons	465.96	4.859
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so a lot of Mines they had in Goa a	468.479	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	bunch of other different parts of India	470.819	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and they used to be in the mining	472.68	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	infrastructure domain then they switched	474.479	4.021
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	majority of their business to oil and	476.46	4.98
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	gas so basically vedanta group is into a	478.5	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	series of different type of businesses	481.44	3.659
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	which has to do with Mining and oil and	482.94	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	gas they have a very large exposure to	485.099	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the Commodities market now what is the	487.56	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	meaning of commodity for example	489.419	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	aluminum you have you have coal you have	490.8	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	oil and gas so all these are what these	493.02	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are natural raw materials which is used	495.0	4.139
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	across different Industries so here are	496.8	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a few Salient points that you should	499.139	3.361
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	know first and foremost commodity Market	500.58	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	saw a massive boom cycle why because of	502.5	5.759
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	China why China consider for example	505.68	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that the Chinese real estate market used	508.259	4.861
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to use the most amount of Steel that was	510.78	4.439
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	consumed all across the world so that	513.12	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	was a major growth trigger for the steel	515.219	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Market aluminum market and again	516.959	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whenever real estate develops you would	518.82	3.0
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	need different types of mineral	520.62	3.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	components so China Market was driving	521.82	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the commodity prices really really high	524.339	4.261
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it was developing the real estate market	526.5	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it was developing the infrastructure	528.6	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Market it required a lot of energy so	530.58	4.319
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	many of the oil and gas company copper	533.1	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	aluminum type of companies they were	534.899	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	benefiting from the China's growth story	536.64	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	but unfortunately after after 2012 there	538.32	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has been lackluster performance in China	541.08	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the China's export Market is suffering	542.94	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	internally their real estate market is	545.16	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	hovering quite aggressively and that is	546.899	3.721
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	where the bad story of vedanta group	548.7	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	starts that they were a pure play	550.62	3.659
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	commodity type of a company and because	552.24	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of the slowdown in the Chinese real	554.279	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	estate market and bunch of other	556.32	3.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	internal consumption markets of China	557.82	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	vedanta also suffered quite badly now	559.64	3.94
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the second problem that the group	562.38	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	suffered it was very simple that the	563.58	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	interest rates are very very high and if	565.56	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the interest rates are inching the last	567.48	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	almost six seven years High then it	569.64	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	becomes a bad scenario for an	571.5	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	infrastructure driven company now when	573.12	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it comes to vedanta when it comes to	575.16	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	adanis what do they need they require	576.959	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	massive amount of capital where will	579.3	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	they get this capital from they will get	581.519	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this Capital by borrowing money and	583.2	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whenever they are borrowing money they	585.18	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will have to pay a rate of interest on	586.74	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that money for example right now if you	588.72	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	have a home loan it might be inching	590.82	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	towards 10 which is very high home loan	592.44	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	rate so to cut the long story short all	594.899	3.841
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	these very heavy infrastructure driven	596.88	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies and they need to borrow it and	598.74	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whenever they are borrowing capital and	601.08	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whatever the rate of interest during	602.88	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that time is that defines the short-term	604.32	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Prospect of that stock which brings us	606.959	3.841
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to the third key trigger and third key	608.82	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	problem with the vedanta group of	610.8	3.479
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company which they are having issues in	612.24	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	terms of interest repayments and a lot	614.279	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of international organizations are sort	616.62	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of not sold on the entire vedanta story	618.779	4.381
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	now just for example Moody's has done an	620.88	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	analysis and they are saying that this	623.16	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is the amount of external debt that the	624.899	4.141
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company has and it can face a lot of	626.7	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	cash Crunch and refinancing crunch in	629.04	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the economy the final reason here	631.14	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	regarding the fall of vedanta stock is	632.7	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that the government itself is not very	634.8	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happy and it is in a war with vedanta	636.959	4.261
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the entire issue stems from the fact	638.94	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that Hindustan zinc which is a company	641.22	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and it is a venture between government	643.019	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of India and vedanta and what vedanta	645.06	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	does is that it also runs a sister	647.7	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company now vedanta what it is trying to	649.32	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	do is that it is fine to sell its sister	651.6	3.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company	653.579	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	which is jointly managed by government	654.98	4.299
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of India and the vedanta group now this	657.24	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is is causing serious worries and the	659.279	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	government has asked sebi to look into	661.5	3.899
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this so this issue is blowing up and	663.24	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	there is less Clarity on this entire	665.399	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	topic someday some positive news comes	667.079	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the stock gives a massive run up someday	669.18	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	negative news comes the stock Falls	671.459	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	quite aggressively so talking about my	673.019	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	verdict on the stock will I be investing	675.24	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	in it the answer is no I will not be	676.92	3.599
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	investing in it simply because of the	678.72	3.359
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Viewpoint that yes the stock has	680.519	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	corrected quite aggressively and it has	682.079	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	been correcting quite aggressively but	683.94	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	at no level you should be investing in	685.86	3.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies where fundamental Clarity is	687.66	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	not there as to where the business is	689.579	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	going to head and if it has serious	691.38	4.199
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	macro issues for example repayment of	693.54	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	debt or interest rates are going to	695.579	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	continue to hurt these type of companies	697.62	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	then generally my particular suggestion	699.48	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would be to stay away from such stocks	701.459	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	okay so the third stock is zomato so	703.38	4.139
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	here is my updated perspective on zomato	705.66	3.239
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	let me quickly explain you the	707.519	3.181
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	fundamentals but let me very quickly	708.899	3.481
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	touch upon the technicals first and how	710.7	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	much the stock price has corrected so	712.38	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	here you can see that the stock price	714.36	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has corrected quite aggressively by	715.92	4.8
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	approximately 70 percent from its stock	718.2	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and when was the top made it was made	720.72	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	almost at the IPO in time since then	722.459	5.101
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato has taken a massive beating now	724.92	4.919
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is there only negative news only or is	727.56	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	there some kind of positive that we can	729.839	4.021
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	observe so the thing is that in startups	731.339	4.321
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	where profits are not there for example	733.86	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato is not really a profitable	735.66	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company yes their revenues are going up	737.279	4.141
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	up and up but their cost is also Rising	739.5	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so therefore it is not a profitable	741.42	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company it is a growth story driven	743.279	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company that people buy zomato stocks	745.62	3.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	because they believe that you know what	747.899	4.321
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato is going to make crazy profits	749.36	4.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and therefore if we buy it now today we	752.22	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will get it at a very good price and we	754.079	4.561
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	might be getting it at an hul type of a	756.6	4.679
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	price so this is a growth story stop now	758.64	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	see there is nothing massively wrong	761.279	3.721
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	with this as long as you are getting it	762.899	3.841
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	at the right price and you're clear	765.0	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	about the business fundamentals of the	766.74	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies so let me explain that very	768.66	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very quickly but Point number one that	770.1	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you need to notice that these type of	771.72	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies usually go through a price	773.519	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Discovery process now what is the	776.04	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	meaning of price Discovery it's means	778.079	4.021
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that the firm iPod here then it dance	780.06	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	around Consolidated then it went up a	782.1	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	little bit then it fell fell fell and	784.079	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	then it started consolidating so this	786.06	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	could be considered as a major	788.399	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	consolidation zone for the stock it has	789.839	4.8
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	been almost one year so this is April	792.36	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	data what we are looking at here this is	794.639	4.021
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it and this is almost March so in this	796.26	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	one year the stock has been	798.66	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	consolidating in this price point now no	799.98	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	one can say for sure that what is the	802.74	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	correct price of a stock but what we can	804.42	4.919
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	definitely agree on is that for the last	806.82	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	one year zomato stock has been	809.339	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	consolidating in this range of 70 to	811.44	5.699
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	roughly 4748 so this is the range where	814.079	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you are getting the stock now please	817.139	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	understand that in the last one one and	818.76	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a half years the market sentiments in	820.74	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the Indian markets or overall even in	822.66	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the World Market has been really bad so	824.579	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	if a particular stock like zomato which	826.62	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	goes through a price Discovery process	829.26	4.319
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	where almost 70 correction of the stock	830.94	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has happened and it has been	833.579	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	consolidating for almost a year this	835.32	5.22
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	becomes a very strong consolidation Zone	837.779	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is the key point that I would like	840.54	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to establish so what does this simply	842.399	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	means that it might very well happen	844.32	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that zomato corrects little bit more or	845.639	4.981
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	maybe like 20 30 more who knows but it	847.8	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is very likely that it will revisit this	850.62	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Zone very very quickly or it might also	852.48	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happen that once the market starts	854.76	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	giving a run up zomato becomes like a	856.68	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very very strong that becomes a	858.779	3.481
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	multi-bagger so to say now to understand	860.22	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that and evaluate that you need to	862.26	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	understand the business changes that	864.12	3.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato is making so the first key change	865.8	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that zomato is making that it is	867.839	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	focusing Less on its 10 minute delivery	869.82	4.199
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	model this isn't a very important change	872.279	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	because up until six seven eight months	874.019	3.841
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	back everyone was talking about 10	876.06	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	minute delivery you know and everything	877.86	3.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will be good this that but that 10	879.6	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	minute delivery thing is done and dusted	881.579	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to a very large extent we can all have	883.56	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	our opinions but the 10 minute delivery	885.779	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	model was not a very profitable thing it	888.12	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	was a cash burn but unfortunately or	890.459	5.041
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	fortunately the VCS have started telling	892.86	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the companies like zomato and VCS were	895.5	5.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	investors in zomato so this	897.6	3.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and this is the same message that has	902.24	4.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	gone out to almost all these startups	904.56	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and all these startups are now trying to	906.72	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	run that profitability race rather than	908.88	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	mad expansion race second thing what	911.1	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	they have started to do is that they	913.26	2.879
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	have started focusing on their core	914.519	3.901
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	business so again I will link zomato's	916.139	3.361
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	case study in the comment and	918.42	2.64
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	description box you can go and watch it	919.5	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that will give you a better sense about	921.06	3.899
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato's business model but for this	922.68	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	video you need to understand the very	924.959	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	simple fact that zomato is focusing	926.639	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	elsewhere its core business model is	928.38	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	number one marketing that it makes a lot	930.6	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of money through the marketing platform	933.06	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that it has what is the marketing	934.92	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	platform the app itself that hotels or	936.66	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	restaurants who are getting featured on	939.12	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato they pay zomato a lot of money to	940.92	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	get featured so that they get more	943.38	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	visibility and more business so that is	945.0	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their first key model that they're	947.04	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	looking at and second is the delivery	948.48	3.659
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	partner model so there zomato has almost	950.22	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	50 market share which is fairly	952.139	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	substantial the other 50 would be owned	953.94	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	by swiggy so this is a split market so	956.519	3.721
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to say so the Logistics Market is	958.199	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	figured out but the ad spent on	960.24	3.719
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	marketing Market is where zomato is	961.98	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	aggressively focusing right now and the	963.959	3.301
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	number one announcement that they have	966.0	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	made is that they are asking the	967.26	4.86
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	restaurants now to keep a budget of at	969.24	4.8
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	least five percent for Revenue	972.12	4.079
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Generations by giving marketing budget	974.04	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to zomato so this is a big number that	976.199	3.721
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	now what zomato is saying that you know	978.48	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	what you have to give us five percent of	979.92	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	your marketing budget whatever sales we	981.54	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are helping you generate so in a way we	983.16	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are taking five percent stake in your	985.32	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company like automatically in one store	986.82	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	on top of this they will charge like	988.74	3.599
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	delivery fees they might do like zomato	990.42	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	gold what not so there are multiple	992.339	4.261
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Avenues through which zomato can turn	994.38	4.379
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	profitable now keeping this you point in	996.6	3.299
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	mind there is a lot of positive	998.759	2.281
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	commentary that is happening with	999.899	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	zomato's talk for example This research	1001.04	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	report here has given it a price target	1003.259	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of 74 rupees which is a substantial jump	1005.12	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	from where it is currently trading again	1007.339	3.781
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is not a push that you go in and	1009.5	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	wears go don't invest I'm just simply	1011.12	3.659
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	helping you understand the model that	1012.92	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	for the timing it looks like the zomato	1014.779	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is actually trying to play the	1016.88	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	profitability game they are focusing on	1018.38	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their Core Business they are expanding	1020.6	3.359
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	into interesting things no doubt about	1022.399	3.66
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that and they are also trying to burn	1023.959	4.021
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	less money by avoiding businesses like	1026.059	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	10 minute delivery and what not so this	1027.98	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is the overarching Viewpoint that I will	1030.02	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	give so for me also I would see the	1031.52	3.899
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock rising to roughly 74. so this is	1033.439	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the Target that I also have in mind I	1035.419	3.481
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will update more on the members	1037.459	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Community section so now let's move on	1038.9	3.179
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to the fourth stock which is the	1040.819	3.301
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	somewhat of a brother of zomato which is	1042.079	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	paytm so paytm also suffered somewhat of	1044.12	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a similar fate to zomato that it got	1046.699	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	listed got crushed by 70 and every day	1048.62	4.92
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it was a bloodbath so let me very	1051.799	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	quickly talk about some of the investor	1053.54	4.139
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	sentiments on paytm very very quickly by	1055.4	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	showing you some Snippets so Point	1057.679	3.421
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	number one is that Maguire research has	1059.24	4.92
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	given a target for paytm at rupees 600.	1061.1	5.52
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	right now the stock is trading at 450	1064.16	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	rupees roughly so this is a substantial	1066.62	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	jump that they are predicting will it	1068.84	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happen will it not happen let me give	1070.64	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you my commentary now Goldman Sachs have	1072.14	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	also given it a very positive commentary	1074.48	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that they are seeing the Target price at	1076.52	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	1150 rupees also if you consider the	1078.26	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	shareholding pattern of zomato you will	1081.26	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	see a slight uptake in the dii holding	1083.0	4.799
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	of zomato so the AI are domestic	1085.94	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Institutional Investor these are Big	1087.799	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	investors from India for example AMC	1089.96	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies mutual funds is that and fiis	1092.179	4.86
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	also haven't really reduced the state so	1094.52	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	everything looks hunky-dory then why is	1097.039	3.181
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it that people are getting tensed about	1098.78	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	paytm this looks like a great buying	1100.22	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	opportunity should you do it should you	1101.84	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	not do it okay so here is the counter	1103.28	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	argument so counter argument one so	1105.14	3.539
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their lead investor which is the and	1107.12	4.32
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Financial Group it plans to exit the	1108.679	4.981
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	paytm stock when it is going to do that	1111.44	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	I don't know but they are very likely to	1113.66	4.019
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	do that now rational has also been	1115.88	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	explained and the rational that was	1117.679	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	given was that paytm has actually done a	1119.299	5.161
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	lot of stock buyback when the stock has	1122.059	3.841
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	fallen quite aggressively somewhere	1124.46	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	around last year 197 communication which	1125.9	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is the parent group for paytm it had	1128.48	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	purchased its own stock now you'll say	1130.34	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that okay this is actually a good sign	1132.44	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that the stock fell and the company	1134.12	5.4
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	purchases its own stocks so it shows	1136.88	4.679
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	positive intent it shows that they are	1139.52	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	believing in their own company so yes	1141.559	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and no because sometimes these type of	1143.48	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	moves are made just to arrest the fall	1145.22	5.04
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that since the company does not want the	1148.1	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock to fall more because what is going	1150.26	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to happen so imagine that there are 1000	1151.88	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stocks the company ends up purchasing	1153.5	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	100 stocks back so what would that do	1155.24	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that will stabilize the other 900 stocks	1157.22	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	otherwise the company might end up in a	1159.44	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very big soup so from that perspective	1161.6	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	don't read too much into it that they	1163.22	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	had to do a lot of buyback was it a good	1164.9	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	move was it not it's highly complicated	1166.82	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so let's not go there but the argument	1168.5	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that is given here is that you know what	1170.78	3.899
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	and financial is going to sell the paytm	1172.34	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	stock why because they had already	1174.679	3.181
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	purchased quite a lot now they have to	1176.36	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	put It On a Block deal and sell it off	1177.86	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that is going to lead a little bit of	1179.6	4.199
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	fall for paytm stock subsequently in the	1181.46	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	future it might happen in one month it	1183.799	2.941
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	might happen in three months no one can	1185.36	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	guess now couple of more issues one has	1186.74	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to do with business fundamentals now if	1188.84	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you take a look at the business of paytm	1191.0	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their primary business is still the	1192.86	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	wallet's business and all this stuff	1194.6	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is not a money making business for	1196.4	4.98
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	example paytm does a lot of transaction	1199.34	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	from its payment wallet so to say or in	1201.38	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	terms of making payments but they take	1203.6	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	rate take rate means that how much money	1205.76	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the company is making from those	1207.38	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	transactions the volume of transaction	1208.82	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	might be 10 000 crore but if the company	1210.74	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is only making one crore or five crore	1212.36	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	from it it is not a very high profitable	1213.98	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	business so to say then comes the	1216.26	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	banking thing now the banking license	1218.12	4.919
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has been given by RBI then some changes	1220.34	5.52
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	were made to it RBI stopped paytm from	1223.039	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	doing certain type of business there was	1225.86	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a lot of hoopla that was there the area	1227.72	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	where paytm is doing wealth is the	1229.64	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	wealth management arm for example when	1231.62	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it comes to mutual funds equities and	1233.419	3.061
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you might have also seen it that that	1235.22	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you can buy all this stuff from paytm's	1236.48	4.14
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	app also and invest in mutual funds so	1238.64	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that business for paytm is picking up	1240.62	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	but the problem is that the entire stock	1242.66	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	market itself is going down so the	1244.46	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	mutual fund industry is not recovering	1245.9	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	as of now maybe it will recover in the	1247.7	3.839
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	future and maybe that will help paytm	1249.74	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	but that again becomes a little bit of a	1251.539	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	timing issue so none of the arms that	1253.64	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you are seeing for paytm it is churning	1255.74	4.439
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	money so to say Mr Vijay shekhar Sharma	1257.6	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is of the opinion that paytm will turn	1260.179	4.141
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	profitable very quickly that remains to	1262.28	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	be seen but as of now there is a lot of	1264.32	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	volatility associated with paytm and	1266.36	4.319
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	even if from a Core Business perspective	1268.76	3.6
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	we cannot Point our finger and say that	1270.679	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you know what this part of paytm's	1272.36	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	business model is going to become like	1274.22	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	golden so please remember that point so	1275.78	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	my verdict on the stock would be that	1278.48	2.88
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	yes the stock has fallen quite	1280.039	2.88
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	aggressively it is getting to a point	1281.36	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	where it might not be a bad idea to	1282.919	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	acquire it but I will still wait and	1284.9	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	watch now comes the final stock I'll be	1286.46	3.0
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	quick here otherwise the video will	1288.2	3.3
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	become really big so the final stock I'm	1289.46	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	going to talk about is Tata lxc now Tata	1291.5	4.799
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Galaxy is actually a good company and it	1294.2	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is into three different streams see so	1296.299	4.201
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the first key thing that Tata Galaxy	1298.7	4.44
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	does it does industrial design second it	1300.5	4.5
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	does is embedded product design and	1303.14	3.419
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	third is the software applications	1305.0	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	associated with it it gets clients from	1306.559	3.961
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	primarily to Industry one is the	1308.78	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	healthcare industry and the second is	1310.52	3.96
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the automotive industry now the problem	1312.32	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is that both Healthcare and Automotive	1314.48	4.439
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Industries are both struggling both have	1316.52	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a ton of inventory that is sitting on	1318.919	3.181
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	their book and you might have seen that	1320.6	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	companies like maruti they have not	1322.1	3.42
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	given even one percent return over the	1323.72	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	last five years zero percent return so	1325.52	3.36
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	it's a problematic situation in both	1327.2	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	these companies and as a result Tata	1328.88	4.799
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Elixir stock has also taken a nosedive	1330.98	5.1
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	now the business update with Tata LX is	1333.679	4.62
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	very simple that it has categorically	1336.08	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	mentioned on its report that it is going	1338.299	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	to move a lot of this product design	1340.34	4.94
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	business into industrial design business	1342.559	5.941
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	now the industrial design business is a	1345.28	5.379
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	more profitable business now let me take	1348.5	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	you to the profit and loss statement	1350.659	2.821
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	what you will see is that okay the sales	1351.98	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	are going up that is wonderful no doubt	1353.48	4.26
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	about that but more interestingly the	1355.82	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	profit margins are going up for example	1357.74	4.74
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that these profit margins are better	1360.02	4.68
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	than the pre-covered time profit margins	1362.48	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	so from that perspective what is	1364.7	3.06
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	happening with the company is that the	1366.32	3.18
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	company is deliberately trying to shift	1367.76	3.48
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	his business to Industrial design	1369.5	3.78
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	business this becomes the money making	1371.24	4.919
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	arm of the business also the stock is	1373.28	5.639
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	available roughly at 40 discount and it	1376.159	4.38
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has been consolidating for the last	1378.919	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	several months almost like seven eight	1380.539	3.361
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	months have happened that these stock	1382.159	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	has been consolidating in this	1383.9	4.259
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	particular range so my game plan has	1385.82	4.02
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	been that I've started to aggregate this	1388.159	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	talk a little bit and going forward I	1389.84	3.54
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	will continue to aggregate this a bit	1391.7	3.959
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	more this is fresh positions for me so	1393.38	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	whenever I am buying more of this stock	1395.659	3.541
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	I will make Community updates now the	1397.159	3.601
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	major risk with this company right now	1399.2	3.24
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is that the industrial design business	1400.76	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	that I spoke about that is a highly	1402.44	4.56
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	competitive business now Tata Galaxy is	1404.539	4.081
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	not just going to have competition from	1407.0	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	within India it is also going to have	1408.62	4.86
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	competition from outside India but the	1410.9	3.72
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	good thing is that the company is	1413.48	2.939
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	preparing for it for example it has done	1414.62	4.2
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	a partnership with Panasonic which is	1416.419	4.681
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	good second key thing is that almost all	1418.82	4.08
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	the geographies beat Russia beat China	1421.1	3.84
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	beat India they are becoming slightly	1422.9	3.779
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	more localized so the Indian government	1424.94	3.359
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	is going to protect the local	1426.679	3.661
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	manufacturing base and a company like	1428.299	4.441
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	Tata Alexi actually benefits from it so	1430.34	3.9
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	this is the perspective with which I	1432.74	3.12
PvNjl0oxMl0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvNjl0oxMl0	would be operating in the stock market I	1434.24	3.36

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	said let me take you through eight	108.24	3.839
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	specific points that I want to discuss	109.799	4.381
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	with you so Point number two and the	112.079	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	prediction number one that I had made	114.18	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	back in December of 2022 was that the	115.74	4.919
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	market is going to fall by approximately	118.5	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	10 percent so this is me saying the same	120.659	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	thing very very good chance that we will	122.759	5.161
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	see a 10 correction in the year 2023. so	124.619	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	let us see whether that prediction has	127.92	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	come true and there are two three very	129.539	3.481
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	important points that I would take you	131.28	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	through so the first key point is and	133.02	2.76
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this is where I've made the prediction	134.52	3.299
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	somewhere in December the markets after	135.78	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that fell by roughly eight percent so	137.819	4.261
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	not exactly 10 but roughly eight percent	139.92	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so I could say that this prediction was	142.08	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	partially true after that the markets	144.48	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have been running and to what extent has	146.4	3.419
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these been running so they have	148.44	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	approximately given as of today roughly	149.819	4.621
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	11 percent gain so if you would have	152.34	3.84
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	purchased a lot of stuff here in this	154.44	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Zone you would have been sitting on a	156.18	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	lot of profits now that is a sales board	157.86	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there is no point in talking about it	159.9	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	what I would like to talk about is this	161.58	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	new phase and this is the phase that I'm	163.86	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	talking about this is more important as	165.72	5.04
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of today why is that it is because of	167.64	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this channel that is getting formed so	170.76	3.119
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	all I've done is that I have drawn the	172.5	3.599
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	support and resistance Line This is a	173.879	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Clear Channel that is getting formed and	176.099	3.241
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there is a very clear technical	178.019	3.181
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	indicator that are getting played here	179.34	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and it looks like that if nothing major	181.2	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happens from this point then this	183.48	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	channel is likely to be respected so	185.459	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	many of you might be sitting and asking	187.86	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the question now that should I wait	190.319	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	should I wait for like maybe two three	192.18	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	months and then start investing I would	194.28	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	say no I would rather encourage you to	196.2	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	build some positions here why because	198.54	4.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you are at this lower end of this	200.7	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	channel there will be times when this	202.739	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	channel would be broken there is a very	205.14	3.239
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	good probability of that happening for	206.76	3.119
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	example the channel might go like this	208.379	3.241
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it may come down like this it might go	209.879	3.301
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	like this it might come down like this	211.62	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and it might get broken also that is	213.18	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there but the point is that this channel	215.28	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	is a very strong channel that has	217.14	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	already got informed so we need to go by	218.76	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	technicals as of now so according to	221.22	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that at least as of now since no major	223.08	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	macro changes are happening per se it is	225.12	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	very very likely that this channel is	227.22	4.019
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	going to get respected and from that	229.2	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	perspective building position or at	231.239	4.321
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	least being 80 invested in the markets	233.159	4.681
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	right now makes a lot of sense so that	235.56	3.899
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	is my understanding of it of course you	237.84	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	can have a contrarian Viewpoint you can	239.459	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	wait for the markets to correct if you	241.26	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have some internal knowledge that you	243.42	2.76
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	know what channel breakdown will happen	244.92	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	here here somewhere there probably you	246.18	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	can do that but as of today Point number	248.4	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	B is that we are definitely in a bull	250.86	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	run I have been saying that for the last	252.9	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	several months that we are in a bull run	254.64	5.04
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I have been orienting my portfolio	257.16	4.799
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	accordingly Community channel members	259.68	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	accordingly I had been explaining every	261.959	4.621
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	single macro commentary quite diligently	264.6	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and you can go and check out all these	266.58	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	posts on channel membership Community	268.32	3.659
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these are still available and this bull	269.88	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	run is going to get accelerated from	271.979	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this point but let me very quickly	274.02	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	present what I had said back in December	275.639	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of 2022 I had said this things are going	277.74	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to happen when it comes to interest rate	280.5	3.0
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Point number one is that the interest	282.0	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rate rise is going to slow down so it is	283.5	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	being forecasted that the interest rate	286.08	5.52
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	in the US will rise to 5.5 then the	287.94	5.52
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	interest rates will start to get cut	291.6	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	down now this is a major point because	293.46	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	whenever the interest rates are cut down	295.8	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the stock market rallies by aggressively	298.02	5.16
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	for example 2008 was a prime example	300.66	5.16
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	2020 kovit was up so now I have been	303.18	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	harping on the fact that we are in a	305.82	3.18
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	bull run and this bull run is going to	307.38	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	get accelerated what makes me say that	309.0	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so one of the central points that make	311.1	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	me say that is the concept of interest	312.78	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rate again I'd explain that presented	314.52	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that entire explanation on that December	316.74	5.1
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	2022 video I will present a very quick	319.02	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	updated version of that see so take a	321.84	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	look at this particular chart what you	323.94	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	will notice is that these are the	325.74	4.679
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	interest rates in India right and what	327.24	5.64
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happens generally in the market is that	330.419	5.101
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	if the interest rates are cut what this	332.88	4.98
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	leads to this leads to more credit flow	335.52	5.28
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	or flow of money in the economy so the	337.86	4.679
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	flow of money will go up if the interest	340.8	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rates are being cut now if the credit	342.539	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	flow in the economy goes up then what	344.759	4.201
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	does that lead to well it leads to the	347.039	3.781
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rocketing or increasing of the stock	348.96	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	market this has played out back after	350.82	6.18
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	2008 this has laid out after 2020 crisis	353.16	6.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	also this has played out after almost	357.0	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	every a single crash so what exactly is	359.28	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happening in this chart so what you will	361.68	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	notice is that India increased its	363.3	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	interest rate from roughly four percent	366.0	5.1
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	all the way to 6.5 and now you might be	367.74	4.98
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	seeing this flat line I'm not sure if	371.1	3.539
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you are able to see this clearly but it	372.72	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	is flat lining why is that the case the	374.639	4.801
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	reason is that the RBI or Reserve Bank	376.979	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of India had decided that you know what	379.44	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	we are just going to pause the rate hike	381.06	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	First Step there is that the central	383.1	3.719
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	banks increase the interest rate second	384.6	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	step is that they pause the interest	386.819	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rate increase third step is that they	388.38	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	cut the interest rate we have already or	390.419	4.441
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	we are already reaching that point where	392.639	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	interest rates hike have been passed or	394.86	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the rate of interest rate hike has been	397.5	4.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	paused Next Step the moment it happens	399.66	3.659
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that the interest rates are being	401.699	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	brought down stock market will become	403.319	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rocket now to what point will the stock	405.419	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	markets go up please watch the entire	407.34	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	video you will get that understanding I	409.08	3.119
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	will reveal the answer along the way	410.88	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	also but this is one of the reasons why	412.199	4.681
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I'm saying that despite being at 18 500	414.36	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	right now we are not finished with that	416.88	4.439
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	bullet that bull run is about to start	419.28	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it will ramp up massively when these	421.319	4.981
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	interest rates are cut and this will not	424.08	4.739
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happen only in India this will happen in	426.3	4.619
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	relationship to the entire world even	428.819	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the U.S well-cut its interest rate even	430.919	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	India will cut its interest rate so very	432.84	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	quickly taking you to United States data	434.88	4.319
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	also so you will see that it has peaked	437.16	5.52
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to 5.5 percent and it is now being	439.199	5.581
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	assumed by analysts that from this point	442.68	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there will not be a massive interest	444.78	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rate hikes there will be interest rate	446.759	4.621
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	cuts it might happen that the markets	448.86	5.7
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	can go in this range of 18 500 to maybe	451.38	5.759
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	like 19 000 in India over the period of	454.56	4.74
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	next three four months but by the end of	457.139	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this year it is very very likely that we	459.3	3.839
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	will definitely beat that nineteen	461.22	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	thousand nineteen thousand five hundred	463.139	3.301
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	levels very easily so this brings me to	464.34	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the third prediction that I had made in	466.44	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	December of 2022 which was about the U.S	468.06	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stock market I had categorically said	470.94	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that the U.S stock market is going to	472.86	3.839
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Rally like anything especially their	474.72	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	indices NASDAQ and s p 500. if you want	476.699	4.921
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to use this information to make a lot of	479.4	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	money then you could consider building	481.62	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	some positions in the U.S stock if your	483.12	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	risk appetite matches so from that	485.16	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	perspective I would say that there is a	487.08	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	good opportunity in NASDAQ and S P 500	488.94	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	right now this is not a buying or	491.46	3.239
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	selling recommendation I'm just simply	493.199	2.94
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	telling you whatever I am doing in the	494.699	3.181
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	market if it makes sense then you could	496.139	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	consider building some positions	497.88	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	especially given the fact that these	499.259	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	entire broad market index which are	501.3	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	relatively less risky they are trading	503.22	4.319
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	at a massive discount right now in the	505.68	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	US so here is the run-up for Nasdaq over	507.539	5.101
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the past six months it has gone up by	510.3	6.0
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	roughly 16 17 so making 16 17 free money	512.64	7.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	almost on a solid asset like NASDAQ	516.3	5.22
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	where the risk profile is very very low	519.839	3.901
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	according to me that's a great bet I had	521.52	4.259
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	been investing quite heavily in the U.S	523.74	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stocks I will be building more positions	525.779	4.201
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	in U.S stocks specifically I will	528.3	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	disclose the names on the member	529.98	3.299
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Community section even right now	531.6	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	investing in the U.S stocks makes sense	533.279	4.141
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	was it a better opportunity six months	535.32	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	ago five six months ago 100 yes it would	537.42	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	was definitely a better opportunity than	539.399	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	compared to now but that does not mean	541.5	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that right now the U.S market is like	543.899	3.721
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	completely done with and there are no	545.94	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	profit making opportunities there there	547.62	3.779
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	are multiple profit making opportunities	549.6	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there so let me present a very quick	551.399	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	updated analysis there also so here is	553.26	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the last six month chart you can clearly	555.42	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	see that 18 gains have been achieved if	556.92	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you consider this right you will see	559.56	5.64
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that NASDAQ is roughly at 13 240 and	561.06	6.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	here the peak of NASDAQ was around	565.2	4.319
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	fifteen thousand so still according to	567.48	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	me there is a good 15 gain to be made on	569.519	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	NASDAQ what is the reason for that so	571.92	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	what is the underlying composition of	573.959	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	NASDAQ it is primarily tech stocks take	575.64	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	a look at Apple's profit take a look at	578.279	3.601
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Google's profit take a look at where	580.14	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	they are pivoting all these things are	581.88	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	pointing to a healthy Direction that's	584.1	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	what it is part B take a look at all the	585.959	3.721
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	negative things that have happened with	588.42	2.88
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these tech companies there were two	589.68	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	primary concerns with tech companies one	591.3	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	was the valuation concern that these	593.7	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	companies have gone up in value like	595.86	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	anything and their valuations is going	597.42	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to get crushed and that happened a lot	599.22	4.559
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of companies corrected by 50 50 60 60	601.8	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	percent but that phase seems to be over	603.779	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the second key problem with tech	606.6	4.7
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	companies was the massive layoff	608.64	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that indicates that there is some deeper	611.3	3.82
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	trouble with these tech companies that	613.56	3.779
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	meta firing like 10 of its Workforce	615.12	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Google firing like 15 of its Workforce	617.339	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I'm just making these numbers but the	619.68	2.94
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rough estimates were somewhere around	621.3	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these that almost every major tech	622.62	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	company had fired like 10 10 15 15 of	624.66	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	their Tech Force so people were assuming	627.3	3.599
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that there is something going off with	629.22	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these tech companies but nothing of that	630.899	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	sort is getting uncovered it means that	633.18	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this was just a cost optimization	635.459	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	exercise and it did not impact their	637.5	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	project scale or their expansion plans	640.019	4.201
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these companies are very much still	642.06	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	solid companies sitting on massive	644.22	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	balance sheet some stocks which I've	646.38	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	been absolutely bullish about for	648.36	3.479
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	example meta has given like 100 hundred	649.86	3.599
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	percent returns which is absolutely	651.839	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	crazy given the size of the company but	653.459	4.261
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	anyways coming back to the topic that	655.86	3.479
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	should you be considering investing in	657.72	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the U.S stocks the answer is still yes	659.339	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that you can definitely pick some bets	661.5	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	here especially if you have that two	663.899	3.901
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	three year vision and in this bull run	665.76	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	also tech stocks are going to perform	667.8	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	exceedingly well if you are thinking	669.839	3.481
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that okay U.S stocks I don't want to	671.7	3.84
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	invest what are some good big brands	673.32	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that I can invest in India I would still	675.54	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	say that banks are in a decent position	677.64	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I will speak more about them	679.74	3.539
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	subsequently so this brings us to the	681.18	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	fourth prediction that I had done and	683.279	3.541
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	had categorically said this so please	684.72	3.359
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	listen to this now my third key	686.82	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	prediction is that debt heavy company	688.079	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that have given a lot of run up in the	689.94	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	last two years are going to get	692.399	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	corrected quite aggressively so Casey so	694.5	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I have no personal animosity with adani	696.899	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	group or Airtel bharti so these were the	699.0	3.779
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	two companies that I've spoken about let	700.98	3.84
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	us look at their performance some people	702.779	3.781
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	are extremely bullish that these	704.82	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	companies are going to do exceedingly	706.56	2.719
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	well	708.36	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	for example let me take you through the	709.279	4.361
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	adani story so let us pick adani	711.6	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Enterprise and let me show you how much	713.64	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it has fallen by in the last six months	715.2	5.34
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so it has gotten crushed by almost 40 in	716.94	5.399
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the last six months now you would say	720.54	3.78

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	question that people need to ask from an	773.279	4.201

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	on question front it's not a clean chip	808.2	3.0
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that they have done a complete	810.12	2.7
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	investigation and given someone a clean	811.2	3.72

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and pursuing the case could be a journey	825.06	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	without a destination a code appointed	827.579	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	panel said do you think that this is	829.98	3.06

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	getting reflected into the market again	842.7	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	if you don't trust it simply ask a	844.74	3.899
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	question that SC expert appointed panel	846.42	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	gave a clean chat so why haven't the	848.639	4.981
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	adani stocks gone up immediately to that	850.98	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	same level as they were previously	853.62	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	trading so that's my simple question	855.48	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	from an investment Viewpoint there is a	857.1	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	lot of layers that needs to be peeled	859.2	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	will not get into that that is not going	861.18	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to be Market related per se but I hope	863.22	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you get the picture that number one	865.26	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	please stay away still from debt heavy	866.82	5.22

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	companies do not do exceptionally well	873.6	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	during the initial phase of a bull run	875.579	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	why is that the case because when the	878.1	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	new money is getting invested into	880.199	3.901
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	certain companies for example or out of	882.12	4.5

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	equation then I would personally feel	922.139	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that something like small cap stocks are	924.12	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	wonderfully placed right now I've done a	926.579	3.361

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	please pick these type of things	936.42	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	according to me again not an investment	937.74	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	advice you can consult your own CB	939.54	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	registered investment advisors and take	941.88	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	their Viewpoint ask them logic that's	943.92	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the most important thing that don't	945.54	3.239
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	invest your own hard-earned money	947.16	3.539
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	depending on what other people tell you	948.779	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	right you have to do your own due	950.699	3.241
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	diligence what is the meaning of due	952.139	3.781
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	diligence it means that you are actually	953.94	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	understanding the logic of everyone and	955.92	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	then making your your own call to invest	958.5	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	your own money so anyways the summary	960.54	3.659
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Point here is that I do not feel that	962.459	3.18
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	debt heavy companies are going to do	964.199	3.361
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	well companies like adani stock	965.639	3.481
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	companies like Airtel might struggle	967.56	2.94
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there is a very high chance that they	969.12	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	might struggle so I am staying away for	970.5	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	them I have not built any position on it	972.48	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and I neither plan on building any	974.639	3.181
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	positions on them so with that said	976.26	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	let's move on to the next point so the	977.82	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	next prediction that I had made was that	979.5	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	a lot of startups in India that are	981.12	3.719
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	unicorn for example by juice an academy	982.86	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	they will all try to project	984.839	4.381
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	profitability from this point because	986.76	4.379
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	they are looking to IPO Point number	989.22	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	four is that I feel that editek	991.139	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	companies are going to exhibit	993.3	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	profitability this now interestingly	995.16	5.22
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	baidu's has pushed its IPO plans a lot	997.62	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of hidden things are coming out on	1000.38	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	baidu's business model I don't know	1001.759	4.561
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	again it becomes a very complicated	1004.16	4.919
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	story to explain but wherever you	1006.32	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	constantly see like promoters in the	1009.079	4.081

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	all the wrong reason just stay away even	1013.16	4.14
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	if they bring the IPO I'm not going to	1015.68	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	invest one rupee in it I'm telling it to	1017.3	4.88
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you point so please don't even approach	1018.8	5.999
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I'm not going to do all that nonsense I	1022.18	4.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	never do such nonsense now do I have	1024.799	3.301
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	personal animosity with a lot of	1026.6	3.479

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	startups that are just simply playing	1033.14	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the valuation game now I simply do not	1034.52	4.439
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	like companies that play Pure valuation	1036.62	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	game now think about this that there is	1038.959	3.901
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	a company called as BlackRock it is an	1040.88	3.84

gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	way to 8 billion dollars now think about	1052.64	4.919
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it that baiju's valuation was 22 billion	1054.799	4.981
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	dollars 22 billion now can you imagine	1057.559	4.381
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	how much money is 22 billion just for	1059.78	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	context and I'm just quoting it from	1061.94	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	memory India's education budget is	1063.86	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	roughly 12 to 13 billion dollars so	1066.02	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that's approximately two times that of	1068.48	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	India's education budget that is the	1070.34	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	size of a startup or with valuation of a	1072.02	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	startup should Ubi as an investor or a	1074.24	4.679
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	retail investor when IPOs come at that	1076.94	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	level should you be buying it the short	1078.919	3.841
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	answer is no you should definitely not	1081.26	3.419
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	be buying it I have been one of these	1082.76	3.72
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	staunch non-supporters of crazy	1084.679	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	valuations of startup I had made video	1086.48	5.16
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	against zomato paytm all these companies	1088.76	5.039
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	when they came up with crazy valuations	1091.64	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I had purchased zomato once it got	1093.799	4.801
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	massively discounted I have built lot of	1096.26	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	positions now it's in green for me I had	1098.6	4.439
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	been speaking about it quite confidently	1101.12	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	now does that mean that you should also	1103.039	3.181
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	go and invest the short answer is no	1104.78	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	let's see any IPO when it gets launched	1106.22	4.74
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it will go through its Market Discovery	1108.919	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	phase right now I've been very bullish	1110.96	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	on SBI cards and for the last three odd	1113.179	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	months I have been building a lot of	1115.46	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	position already quite in green why is	1116.539	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that the case so let me take you to its	1119.419	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	IPO history so this is where the IPO	1121.4	5.58
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	opened for SBI payments 724 and 2-3	1123.5	4.98
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	months back it was again back at that	1126.98	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	same level after dancing around for	1128.48	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	close to three years so nowadays what is	1130.4	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happening is that these companies goes	1132.38	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	through a price Discovery phase so wait	1134.0	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	for this price Discovery phase to get	1136.34	4.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	over then get into it in good companies	1138.38	5.039
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that you have trust upon right now I am	1140.539	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	not in a position to comment whether	1143.419	3.241
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this startup is good that startup is	1144.919	3.361
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	good it is very very difficult to	1146.66	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	ascertain that as a normal retail	1148.28	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	investor so the next prediction that I	1150.02	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	had made was the fact that mid-gap	1151.76	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stocks are going to do exceedingly well	1153.32	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	midi cap and small cap stocks are going	1155.0	5.22
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to outperform large cap Stocks by a mile	1157.58	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	why am I saying it so let me quickly	1160.22	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	take you to the small cap and mid cap	1161.84	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	index do some index analysis and then I	1163.82	3.719
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	will help you understand some context so	1165.86	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you can see that this is the midi cap	1167.539	4.561
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	index in India and from its top it is	1169.46	5.28
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	trading at roughly 11 discount as of now	1172.1	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and guess what one of my primary	1174.74	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	contributors to my own portfolio had	1176.72	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	been mid cap stocks they have done	1178.7	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	exceptionally well over the last few	1180.679	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	months just for context this is when I	1182.48	4.439
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	had made the video so roughly here and	1184.64	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	even if we did not invest any single	1186.919	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	money after this then also you would	1189.5	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have been approximately at seven percent	1191.78	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	gain but if you chose to invest during	1193.46	5.339
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the fall also in this entire fall your	1196.4	4.019
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	profits would have been crazy so	1198.799	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	approximately on my mid cap portfolio I	1200.419	3.981
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	am sitting on a gain of roughly 18 to 20	1202.46	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	over the last three four months itself	1204.4	4.0
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so now you might say that okay this	1206.78	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	rally is over so okay maybe maybe not	1208.4	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	yes Medicap right now is at its all-time	1210.44	5.099
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	high great opportunity to have invested	1213.02	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	five six months back but that does not	1215.539	4.741
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	mean that now is not a good time small	1217.94	4.619
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	caps at this juncture are in a better	1220.28	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	position according to me so I am	1222.559	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	building a lot of positions in small	1224.419	3.421
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	gaps why is that the case let me take	1225.799	3.541
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you through a very quick snippet here	1227.84	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	here is the market performance of small	1229.34	5.52
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	cap compared to nifty 50 during a bull	1231.799	5.281
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	run phase so you will see that whenever	1234.86	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there is a bull run in the market so	1237.08	3.599
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	approximately Market stays sideways for	1238.76	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	70 of the time maybe in a bull run 20 of	1240.679	5.941
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the time and their run 10 of the time so	1243.62	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	what you would notice is that whenever	1246.62	3.78
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	there is a bull run for example 2003	1248.12	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	sensex or Nifty you can pick either of	1250.4	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the indices it will give approximately	1252.98	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the same performance sensex went up by	1254.6	5.76
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	91 92 percent small cap almost 2X and	1257.0	4.679
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you will see this trend playing out	1260.36	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	except for maybe one or two exceptions	1261.679	4.141
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	here you will always see this trend	1263.78	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	playing out this phase from 2016 to 2018	1265.82	5.16
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	was an anomaly time what was the reason	1268.46	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	for that that there was a small cap	1270.98	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	restructuring that happened that a lot	1272.66	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of mutual funds had to sell their small	1274.28	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	caps as per CV regulations so that	1276.02	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	brought down the evaluation for small	1278.66	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	caps and there was Heavy beating of	1280.34	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	small caps but outside that small caps	1282.26	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have performed wonderfully better	1285.14	4.019
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	compared to Nifty 50s and sex in any	1286.52	4.92
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Bull Run so if you want to put little	1289.159	4.861
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	bit more risky money consider small cap	1291.44	5.099
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	over adani stock and do like index-based	1294.02	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	investing in order to lower your risk	1296.539	3.841
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	but yes in case you are interested in	1298.28	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	learning more about specific stocks that	1300.38	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I am considering I do present a detailed	1302.419	4.081
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	viewpoint on every single thing that I'm	1304.64	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	doing on the member Community tab so you	1306.5	3.539
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	can check it out so now comes the next	1308.6	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	prediction I had given some commentary	1310.039	3.421
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	around Banks so let's quickly listen to	1311.72	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it t at false this is strategy number	1313.46	5.04
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	one I still feel that banks are going to	1315.98	5.1
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	give very good returns in the year 2023	1318.5	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so okay so from a bank point of view	1321.08	3.479
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have we done well it depends on the	1322.88	3.06
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	segments of the banks that you are	1324.559	3.48
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	looking at so if you have purchased a	1325.94	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	top tier corporate banks for example	1328.039	5.161
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	HDFC ICICI access so these banks have	1329.96	5.579
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	done okay HDFC hasn't performed as of	1333.2	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	now my bet is that it is going to	1335.539	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	perform from this point on why is that	1337.4	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the case simply because of the fact that	1339.799	5.461
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	fii money is returning and they usually	1341.9	5.639
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	build positions in top tier Banks so	1345.26	4.74
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	from that perspective Banks like HDFC	1347.539	5.041
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Bank codec ICICI Bank they are going to	1350.0	5.1
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	show even better run up ICICI has	1352.58	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	performed better compared to other	1355.1	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	traditional top end Banks now why was	1356.78	4.74
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that the case because ICICI was a legard	1359.179	3.961
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stock for the last couple of years on	1361.52	3.0
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	the flip side if you look at the other	1363.14	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	segment of the bank for example small	1364.52	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Finance Banks which have been extremely	1366.44	3.42
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	bullish on for example these would be	1368.12	3.299
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	something like Ecuador small Finance	1369.86	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	these would be a G1 small Finance pnb	1371.419	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	canara bank so all these type of banks	1373.88	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	have done really really well over the	1376.039	3.901
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	last six months so over time I will be	1377.9	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	cutting my positions on small Finance	1379.94	3.84
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	bank I have already made very good gains	1381.86	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	in it some of my banks are stuck for	1383.78	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	example avas financiers is one of the	1385.82	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stocks where I have taken heavy beating	1387.919	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	it the BET hasn't gone my way as of now	1389.84	4.68
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	but the fundamentals look good I would	1392.299	4.021
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	continue to hold my stocks for a bit	1394.52	4.139
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	unless this situation changes there is	1396.32	4.26
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	no reason for me to sell it I do feel	1398.659	3.601
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that these stocks are going to come back	1400.58	4.079
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	up so from that perspective I feel that	1402.26	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	going forward from this point what is	1404.659	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	going to happen is that top end banks	1406.58	4.2
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	are going to do well it's not as if that	1409.039	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	something like HDFC is going to do badly	1410.78	4.44
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	in fact it is very well placed to do a	1412.7	4.38
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	very good Rally from this point as per	1415.22	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	my understanding of course I can be	1417.08	4.02
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	wrong if your analysis tells you to	1418.76	4.86
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	invest please go and do it my analysis	1421.1	4.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	tells me to invest since I have already	1423.62	3.36
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	built quite heavy positions I am not	1425.299	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	buying HDFC Bank I'm already in good	1426.98	4.319
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	profits there I'm just waiting for HDFC	1428.96	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Bank to give a breakout and again please	1431.299	5.281
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	go and reread the ITC growth story that	1433.58	5.04
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	ITC has given like massive run up on	1436.58	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	over the last six eight months so	1438.62	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	whenever breakout happens the breakout	1440.539	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	happens like crazy you will not be able	1442.52	3.24
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to chase it so you need to build	1444.2	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	positions earlier on good stocks and	1445.76	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	stay put during the bull run so that is	1448.28	3.18
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	a simple message that I am going to give	1450.08	3.12
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you but yes if you are considering	1451.46	3.959
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	investing in banking it's a good sector	1453.2	5.099
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to invest even now because fi money is	1455.419	4.74
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	going to come in heavy volume and they	1458.299	3.601
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	are going to build Crazy positions of	1460.159	3.541
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	crazy higher positions in Finance stocks	1461.9	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and that is going to propel the rally	1463.7	3.54
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that is my understanding of course I can	1465.44	3.479
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	be off now comes the final prediction	1467.24	3.6
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	that what Nifty levels can we expect	1468.919	4.981
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	from this point on so here I will tell	1470.84	4.8
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	you two three things so in the short	1473.9	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	term I see the levels 19500 getting	1475.64	5.519
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	achieved when will this happen if the	1478.46	5.579
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	breakout of 18 800 or the previous High	1481.159	5.281
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	actually sustains so if there's any sort	1484.039	4.441
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	of volume there this is the Target that	1486.44	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	we are likely to hit so whatever bulk	1488.48	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	positions I'm going to make from this	1490.76	4.56
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	point it will be after 18 800. so this	1492.38	5.279
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	is point one point two is that where do	1495.32	4.5
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	I see Nifty hitting like at what max	1497.659	3.661
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	level do I see Nifty hitting this year	1499.82	3.66
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so technical patterns are getting formed	1501.32	4.32
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	so this is a cup with handle pattern and	1503.48	4.199
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	if you pick this depth the indicator	1505.64	5.34
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	comes out to be roughly 21 500 levels so	1507.679	5.701
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this is where I see the Nifty going I am	1510.98	3.9
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	not going to do heavy selling before	1513.38	4.08
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	this level is achieved I might do some	1514.88	4.62
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	Channel trading I might take some swing	1517.46	3.3
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	trades depending on the market	1519.5	3.96
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	circumstances that thing I will continue	1520.76	5.58
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	to do but my core portfolio I am not	1523.46	5.819
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	going to change up until we hit 21 500	1526.34	4.98
gyafvPBJId8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyafvPBJId8	and post that I will reassess the	1529.279	3.78

PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so let me discuss eight Central points	92.28	3.839
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that I want to communicate the First	94.38	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Central Point is the type of investor I	96.119	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	am because many of you would be watching	98.34	3.12
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this video and yeah except this is like	99.84	3.12
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	a mutual fund investor okay so please	101.46	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	understand this point more Point number	102.96	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	one is that I invest most of my money	104.46	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right whatever money goes into the	107.04	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	market in stocks directly in stocks why	108.659	4.381
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is that the case because I am a highly	111.24	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunistic investor I am not the type	113.04	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of a guy who buys and forgets keeps	115.38	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	doing sip unnecessarily never books	117.72	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	profit and all that stuff I do not	120.0	3.299
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	believe in that theory I have made	122.04	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	enough videos around that so my goal	123.299	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	always is to scout for Market	125.46	3.719
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunities and if I find those	126.96	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunities in the mutual fund market	129.179	3.241
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	then I move to the mutual fund Market	130.86	3.599
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	but majority of the time I invest	132.42	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	directly through stocks why directly	134.459	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	through stocks because it is easier for	136.56	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	me to cut my losses or book profits	138.42	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	whenever opportunity presents now that	141.3	3.299
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is something that I've been able to	143.22	3.239
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	successfully do in my mutual fund	144.599	3.841
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	portfolio also I will reveal this point	146.459	3.841
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	also second is that I am a macro	148.44	4.439
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	convection oriented investor what does	150.3	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that mean that simply means that my	152.879	4.201
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	belief is that macroeconomic moves most	154.62	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of the stock market I do believe in	157.08	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fundamental analysis technical analysis	159.0	4.379
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	but for me macroeconomics trumps	160.98	3.839
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	everything that is something that I	163.379	3.181
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	teach on my member Community also to my	164.819	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	students also and that is something that	166.56	3.3
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I keep on preaching that I am a macro	168.3	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investor I look at big bets and I put in	169.86	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	large amount of money behind those bits	172.44	4.379
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	just to give you some context example so	174.66	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this is a video where I purchase Nifty	176.819	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	approximately one year by back this	178.739	3.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	still reflects into my account	180.9	3.119
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	interestingly I am going to sell this	182.04	4.559

PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	but one year ago I was very bullish on	186.599	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	nifty 50 I was seeing massive	188.519	3.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunities I've done that time and	190.08	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	time again be it like idfc first talk	191.879	4.381
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	beat Hindustan Unilever stock bunch of	193.8	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	other different things U.S stocks	196.26	3.3
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	approximately six months back I was	197.76	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	extremely bullish now I don't feel at	199.56	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this juncture that you know what nifty	201.959	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	50 is going to go up at a very fast pace	203.64	5.94
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	by 10 15 I see better and 15 growth	206.099	5.581
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunities in other segments other	209.58	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sectors which I will discuss	211.68	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	subsequently on the video but the point	213.06	4.259
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that I want to drive home is that I am a	215.28	5.039
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	an opportunistic investor B I am a macro	217.319	5.461
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investor and I go after the things that	220.319	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I have conviction on and final point is	222.78	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that I invest most of my money still in	225.0	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	equities My Equity portfolio is much	227.28	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bigger than my mutual fund portfolio how	229.44	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	much is so I'm not going to talk about	231.599	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	how much this that but let me very	233.94	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	quickly take you through my entire	235.799	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund portfolio and here is the	237.36	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	breakdown so just to help you understand	239.519	3.901
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the point more so you can see that some	241.2	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of my biggest bets have been in direct	243.42	5.16
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	nifty 50 or the entire Indian stock	245.519	5.161
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	market which could be sensex or this	248.58	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	could be BSE sensex Index Fund so you	250.68	3.059
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	can see that you know I've invested like	252.659	4.92
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	1.14 CR on one mutual fund only right	253.739	6.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	SMP BSC sensex and this is our overall	257.579	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Index right similarly if you take a look	260.04	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	at some of my biggest bets in mutual	262.26	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund so you'll see Navi nifty 50 50.	264.36	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this is a pure Index Fund uh similarly	266.1	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my third biggest bet would be DSP nifty	268.68	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	50 so this is again a nifty fifty fund	270.78	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	now you'll say you said that you're not	272.759	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	your portfolio is fairly recent so can	274.56	5.28
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you prove it okay so let me show you	277.259	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	first Navi one right so here is Navi one	279.84	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I will go on view transactions and you	281.94	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will see that I started building	284.04	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	positions roughly one year ago on this	285.36	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	similarly if I take you to my earliest	287.88	4.379
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bed and this is a mutual fund where I	290.58	3.059
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	would have built position the earliest	292.259	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so this was also in August of 2021 and	293.639	5.041
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in the last one and a half years the	296.759	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	markets have been sideways but my mutual	298.68	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund portfolio has given roughly 11 and	300.72	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	a half percent so which is a fairly	302.94	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	comprehensive way of beating the market	304.44	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in a way now of course there would be	305.94	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investors who would have made more money	308.16	3.06
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	than me there would have been investors	309.54	3.12
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	who would have lost a lot of money so	311.22	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this is not like a chest thumping thing	312.66	3.479
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I'm simply presenting the data in a very	314.22	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	transparent manner now let me introduce	316.139	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you to some of my other bits for example	318.06	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I have small cap funds so if you check	319.919	4.381
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this for example this was purchased last	322.08	4.619
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	month right in May again if you take a	324.3	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	look at this almost all my small caps	326.699	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	were purchased in me only right and just	329.16	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	slightly maybe before that and similarly	331.38	4.259
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	if I keep showing you even these index	333.6	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	oriented this was purchased in Jan so	335.639	4.021
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the average lifespan of my mutual fund	337.68	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will be less than a year so with that	339.66	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	said what specific strategies have I	341.58	3.839
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	used in terms of nurturing my portfolio	343.44	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so for that let me move to step number	345.419	4.141
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	two or Point number two so Point number	347.759	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	two is that I am a big proponent of	349.56	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	passive investing compared to active	351.72	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing in mutual funds what is the	353.58	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	difference between active investing and	355.62	2.88
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	passive investing let me give you an	357.12	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	example SBI Magnum midi Cap Fund so this	358.5	5.039
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is an actively managed midi Cap Fund so	361.139	4.261
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	why have I purchased an actively managed	363.539	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Medicap small cap I will explain that	365.4	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	subsequently on the video but for that I	367.199	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mean I would want you to notice that hey	369.24	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this amount is lesser compared to like	371.039	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the other big amounts that I've invested	373.8	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so if you just scan through my portfolio	375.72	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	just 1.14 is here right I mean 91 is	377.4	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	here all that stuff so you'll see that	380.039	3.181
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you know roughly five here I have	381.72	3.599
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invested two and a half around has been	383.22	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in pure index only so I'm a net net	385.319	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	index investor when it comes to mutual	387.3	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds so why is that the case so for	389.4	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that let me take you to a very quick	391.38	4.259
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	case study of ICICI Prudential and there	392.94	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	are two three points that I would want	395.639	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you to notice very quick recap what	397.139	5.221
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	passive funds or index funds are versus	399.3	5.64
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	what active funds are so the previous	402.36	5.339
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	example of small cap mid cap that I gave	404.94	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you there what happens is that the	407.699	4.201
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund manager sits and decides	409.56	4.919
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	every day I'm going to buy this	411.9	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	particular stock and then I'm going to	414.479	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sell it you know after a week then I	416.34	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will aggregate new stuffs so what what	418.139	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is the mutual fund manager doing there	420.18	4.139
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so the mutual fund manager is actively	422.22	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	managing the portfolio that kharidi mine	424.319	4.921
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right buying and selling of the stock is	427.02	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	happening quite regularly and the mutual	429.24	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund manager has a lot of discretion of	431.34	4.859
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	what needs to happen in my case the	433.56	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reason why I prefer passive investing or	436.199	4.261
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	index investing when I am going and	438.78	3.479
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing in something like SNP BSE	440.46	4.92
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sensex that's an index nifty 50 is an	442.259	5.821
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	index so here the mutual fund manager	445.38	4.7
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	does not have the discretion	448.08	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that what is it that the mutual fund	450.08	5.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	manager has to buy and sell if nifty 50	452.52	4.799
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stocks are these 50 stocks then the	455.099	4.141
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund manager will have to go and	457.319	4.921
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	buy these 50 stocks only at the day when	459.24	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I am depositing the money so so there	462.24	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	can be t plus 1 t plus 2 depending on	463.86	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the rules but net net the discretion for	465.84	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund manager on passive funds is	468.24	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	very limited to begin with so that is	470.58	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the first reason why I believe my	472.5	3.479
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	narrative more compared to mutual fund	474.24	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	managers narratives and therefore I	475.979	4.201
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	prefer passive funds second credit point	477.9	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is the expense ratio is less so I have	480.18	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to pay less fees also you give mutual	482.22	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund manager right the fund manager does	484.139	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	not have to use his or her brain what to	486.9	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	buy what not to buy you simply need to	488.759	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	go and buy a BSE sensex that's it right	490.62	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so in passive funds so even the expense	493.319	4.861
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	ratio is less third critical reason is	495.84	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that's it I told you that I am an	498.18	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunistic investor what does that	499.919	5.161
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mean that if I feel that market is have	502.08	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reached that point or this fund has	505.08	4.679
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reached its peak I can cut my position	507.3	5.34
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	easily without bearing any losses here	509.759	4.861
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you will see that exit load is zero	512.64	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percent but when it comes to active	514.62	3.659
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual funds the problem happens that	516.3	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	these funds sometimes put one one	518.279	3.841
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percent exit load also if you go and	520.08	3.3
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sell it after six months you will have	522.12	2.279
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to pay us like one or one percent	523.38	2.64
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	penalty right so that becomes like a	524.399	3.181
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	headache and it becomes a problem for me	526.02	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	but I hope I was able to communicate the	527.58	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	point why do I prefer passive investing	529.62	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	more over active investing and whenever	532.08	5.4
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I do passive investing I do it in bulk I	534.12	6.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	take very concrete focused bets I do not	537.48	5.52
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	do sips so I do not run even one single	540.54	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sip so now you might have a natural	543.0	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	response that okay you said that you are	544.62	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	going to sell your nifty 50 when are you	546.48	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	selling I'm selling it very soon right	548.16	3.239
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so I mean literally like hopefully this	550.08	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	week itself when exactly I will make the	551.399	3.421
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	announcements in the member Community	553.68	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stock market students I'll reveal the	554.82	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	entire answer but I'm close to selling	557.459	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it why is that the case let me give you	559.08	4.439
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	a very quick explainer there see this is	560.94	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the technical chart for Nifty 50. we are	563.519	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	looking at at a daily candle let me just	565.74	3.599
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	quickly draw the numbers here right so	567.6	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this would be 18 800 this is the level	569.339	4.981
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that Nifty has recently breached right	571.92	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so for the last two years the Nifty was	574.32	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	dancing in this zone right so I will	576.24	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	draw the line also so this is the line	577.86	5.099
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that you see so this was the zone that	580.14	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	was not getting broken easily right so	582.959	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this was a problem here now Nifty has	584.76	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	broken and it is trading somewhere in	587.04	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this Zone my hypothesis is that as The	588.959	5.101
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Bull Run gets stronger Nifty might move	591.66	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	up right so it might start trading in	594.06	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this room right first it will go to 19	596.1	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	000 that might become the next	598.14	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	resistance Point very difficult to	599.7	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	predict what exactly will be the next	602.1	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	resistance we need to look at more data	603.66	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	for that but for the timing I'm just	605.58	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	explaining you the concept that the next	607.38	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	major resistance Point YB 19000 then it	609.54	4.919
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will become like let's say around 20 000	612.24	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right so these are different different	614.459	4.021
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	layers so this would be Layer Two this	616.56	3.899
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	would be layer three where Nifty would	618.48	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	dance it might dance from here right it	620.459	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	might go a little bit here here and then	623.1	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it might give a breakout here right so	624.839	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this is how the dancing might happen so	626.58	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I am trying to trade these lines and	628.8	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	therefore right now I feel that in nifty	630.66	4.619
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	50 right and this is a very very	633.42	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	important concept here which I am trying	635.279	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to communicate so please listen to this	637.32	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	part carefully that I do not think that	639.0	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in the next one one and a half year	641.1	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Nifty is going to go up aggressively by	642.48	6.12
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	15 without without this is the critical	645.0	6.06
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	part without some of the large gaps	648.6	6.299
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	going up by 25 or midi cap going by 30	651.06	8.279
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	35 40 this is the mid Gap mid cap to	654.899	7.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small cap so this is the bet that I am	659.339	4.801
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	playing right that rather than putting	661.98	5.039
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my money somewhere here I would rotate a	664.14	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	big chunk of the money here in these	667.019	4.141
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	segments which large cap stocks will I	669.0	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	be buying right now which small cap mid	671.16	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap companies I'll be buying which	673.26	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	specific small cap mid cap stocks	674.82	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	directly I will buy how will I design	676.98	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that portfolio when exactly will I be	678.839	4.141
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	booking profit all this stuff I will	680.88	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reveal the answers on the member	682.98	3.479

PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	checking it out in the description and	694.14	3.18
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	comment box but to cut the long story	695.64	4.259
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	short I am already letting you know that	697.32	4.139
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I am going to move money from here to	699.899	3.541
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	here this is where I am booking profit	701.459	3.901
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	again please go and check my live	703.44	3.899
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing video I had made enough last	705.36	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	year right around this topic of nifty 50	707.339	4.381
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing why it was a bulk buying	709.56	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunity and now I'm simply booking	711.72	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	profits okay so now comes the next point	713.7	2.879
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that okay if you're cutting your	715.5	2.76
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	position nifty 50 do you think that	716.579	3.361
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	nifty 50 is not going to move no of	718.26	2.819
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	course that is going to move so again	719.94	3.12
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	recapping the important point that if	721.079	4.861
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	nifty 50 goes up by 10 then I feel that	723.06	4.92
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in other sectors for example small cap	725.94	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	midi cap some of the large gaps those	727.98	4.919
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	aspects or those assets are going to	730.92	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	move at a much faster rate from this	732.899	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	point of course I can be wrong this is	735.0	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	not a recommendation that you should	736.98	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	also do the same but one key area on	738.779	4.261
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	where I am betting right now is the	741.42	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small cap and that is the reason why and	743.04	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this brings me to 0.3 that that is the	745.14	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reason why I am purchasing a lot of	747.06	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small cap mid caps not only from now but	748.92	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	for the last three months so I can show	751.32	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that to you so for example codec small	753.12	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Cap Fund you will see my transaction	755.519	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	rate right so this is me again if you	757.44	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	take a look at something like HDFC small	759.959	5.94
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap then take a look at this so this	762.66	5.04
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	would again be somewhere in May and	765.899	3.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	since then these funds have already gone	767.7	3.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	up by five five seven seven percent in	769.2	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	value so you might have a natural	771.06	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	question right now should we also invest	772.8	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in small cap midi caps right now is it a	775.32	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	good buying opportunity here see	777.6	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	according to me it is what is the reason	779.04	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	for that very very simple that whenever	781.32	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	a growth Market comes if you are of the	783.24	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opinion that we are in a growth phase	785.519	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right now now if you take a look at the	787.62	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	last three months of fii buying data so	790.2	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	let me show that to you also so here is	792.24	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the fii buying data what about diis net	793.92	4.919
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sellers they have been in May but last	796.62	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	two months or the previous two months	798.839	3.3
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	they were buying right and they have	800.82	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	been buying for the previous five months	802.139	4.861
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	before that so net and net both fiis and	804.48	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diis are getting bullish now when diis	807.0	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	get bullish and on top of that one from	809.7	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my previous videos these diis are	811.98	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	setting on their highest ever cash	814.38	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	positions in the last three to four year	816.12	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right so their cash position is very	818.579	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	high it simply means that as a	821.1	5.16
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percentage of AUM for example if these	822.959	6.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diis or domestic institutional investors	826.26	5.579
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	have let's say 100 crores of AUM then	828.959	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	their cash position might be three	831.839	2.94
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percent right now right so which is	833.339	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fairly High three to four percent and	834.779	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this money is going to get deployed	836.82	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	where more space specifically in small	838.44	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	and mid caps fiis when they buy they	840.6	4.799
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mostly buy large caps it's gonna be	843.12	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reason I I can tell you because fiis	845.399	4.981
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	when they put in money they do a lot of	847.86	5.7
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	hedging right but in small caps the	850.38	5.459
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	problem is that you can't buy direct	853.56	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Hedges it is very difficult to hedge	855.839	3.421
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	your positions there are methods to do	857.519	3.781
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it right indirectly but direct hedging	859.26	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is very difficult to do in directly in	861.3	4.92
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small cap and Medicap stocks but in	864.0	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	large cap stocks you can do that so fii	866.22	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	buying in large caps right so large caps	868.26	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	are also going to move up at least the	870.54	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	undervalued ones and definitely the	872.22	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	entire segment for small and mid caps is	874.32	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	likely to go up now you might have a	876.24	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	natural question that okay which	878.1	3.479
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	specific small cap mid cap I should buy	879.48	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	please listen to the video I will reveal	881.579	3.62

PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to buy versus not but before going there	888.779	4.141
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	let me cover Point number four the point	890.82	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	number four and I will take you again to	892.92	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my portfolio here is that I would want	895.019	6.021
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you to focus on funds like	897.48	6.18
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	total stock market fund right and then	901.04	4.06
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	there are a couple of more funds that	903.66	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you could scroll through and see so	905.1	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	these were all my U.S bets right so they	906.66	5.1
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mostly invest in the US market all these	909.54	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	different funds I wanted to put my money	911.76	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in the U.S market six months back why	913.98	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	because that was a bulk mine massive	916.62	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bulk buying opportunity there I bet on	918.42	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it huge profits now you'll say that	920.579	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	actually you're not buying direct stocks	922.92	4.859
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in the US I actually maxed out my 250k	924.839	5.761
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	which is the lrs limit to invest in U.S	927.779	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stocks I again made the announcements in	930.6	3.419
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the member Community section regarding	932.519	3.901
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the same I had no other option but to go	934.019	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	via the mutual fund route otherwise I	936.42	3.419
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	would not have gone there now this is	938.339	3.3
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	something that I plan on holding as of	939.839	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	now at least in the short term I don't	941.639	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	see myself selling it but when the	943.32	4.259
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	NASDAQ presents a good opportunity to	945.72	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sell then maybe I'll sell some of these	947.579	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I'm not 100 sure as of now natural	949.38	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	question comes that should we also	951.54	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diversify outside India my advice or	953.16	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	this is not a recommendation this is	956.16	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	just a simple advice whatever I have	957.54	3.299
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	done is the simple message that I give	959.16	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to everyone so see diversification is	960.839	3.901
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	very important and one way of	963.18	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diversifying your Holdings is very	964.74	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	simple that remove or at least try to	966.72	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bring down your Geographic risk it is	969.12	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	great Indian economy is growing most of	970.8	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my money is invested in India completely	972.899	4.261
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bullish on it but at the same time as an	974.579	4.801
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investor I need to prepare for all sorts	977.16	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of situations so from that perspective	979.38	4.139
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diversifying my investments outside	981.54	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	India makes a lot of sense right now if	983.519	5.641
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I have 100 rupees in mutual fund Plus	986.1	6.06
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stocks then 80 goes in India right now	989.16	5.7
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right and 20 goes in the U.S going	992.16	5.099
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	forward I am going to somewhat make it	994.86	5.58
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	70 30 right why is that the case bunch	997.259	4.921
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of other different reasons nothing to do	1000.44	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	with like overall macroeconomy but	1002.18	3.659
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	because of the fact that I want to be	1004.1	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	slightly more Tech heavy I don't see	1005.839	4.44
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	such opportunities in India lot of talks	1007.94	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that you know Indian IIT industry is	1010.279	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	going to revive bunch of good good stuff	1011.72	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is going to happen but long term I'm not	1013.699	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bullish on Indian I.T industry I want to	1015.56	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	take more bets on Innovative Tech so so	1017.66	3.359
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	from that perspective I will be	1019.639	3.361
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	following this particular split so this	1021.019	3.18
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is my perspective on International	1023.0	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing this is an important point now	1024.199	4.681
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you see however you want to diversify if	1026.72	3.239
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you want to do Geographic	1028.88	2.88
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diversification then definitely	1029.959	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing in some International mutual	1031.76	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds so to say makes a little bit of	1033.62	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sense so now comes the next point that	1035.54	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you would have scanned through my mutual	1037.76	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund portfolio and you would not have	1039.319	5.401
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	seen things like Nifty next 50 or large	1041.0	7.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap funds or hybrid funds or flexi cap	1044.72	5.22
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds so why is it that I'm not buying	1048.02	3.659
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	all these funds honestly according to me	1049.94	4.619
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I do not believe too much in it why is	1051.679	4.441
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that so let me start the story by	1054.559	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	telling you about large cap actively	1056.12	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	managed funds so here is the data to	1058.28	3.18
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	prove it that whether you look at one	1060.08	2.94
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	year three year five year Benchmark	1061.46	3.839
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	returns four large gaps and you can see	1063.02	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it here what you will notice is that	1065.299	3.901
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	only 11 percent actively manage large	1067.039	5.161
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap mutual funds beat their Benchmark so	1069.2	5.28
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I honestly do not see any point in terms	1072.2	5.04
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of investing in large gap mutual funds	1074.48	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	which are actively managed right that is	1077.24	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	what data what about hybrid fund so what	1078.799	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	are hybrid funds hybrid funds means that	1081.38	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	they can have debt also they can have	1083.539	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Equity also and they when the situation	1085.34	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	arises the mutual fund manager will make	1087.5	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the decision to move money from Equity	1089.48	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to debt and go debt heavy or Equity	1092.0	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	heavy no right so if I want to invest in	1093.74	4.679
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	debt I'll invest in debt if I want to	1096.62	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invest in equity I will invest in equity	1098.419	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	there are times when you should be and	1100.34	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it's very easy to figure out when to	1102.559	3.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invest in debt versus Equity that's not	1103.82	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	a problem for me so therefore I do not	1105.86	4.439
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	have any hybrid funds even from a debt	1107.84	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds perspective that mutual fund	1110.299	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	perspective indexation benefits have	1112.1	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	been done away with so according to me	1113.96	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	there is no difference between debt fund	1115.7	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	wine or investing in fds if I have to	1117.44	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	keep some safe money I would just simply	1119.9	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	do FD over sticking my money in debt	1121.64	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual funds okay so what is the meaning	1123.919	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of nifty next 50. so these are companies	1125.6	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that range in market cap from rank 51st	1127.64	4.86
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to 100 so you're not betting on top 50	1130.46	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	companies in India you are somehow like	1132.5	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you know betting on companies 51 200 the	1134.24	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	problem is that there is no logic to	1136.76	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing in it for example I'm going to	1138.26	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	buy the 50 best companies in India nifty	1140.84	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	50 makes sense it's low risk but let's	1142.88	3.539
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	say that some company starts doing some	1144.919	3.181
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	couple of which is a nifty 50 and you	1146.419	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	know some bad reporting comes out and	1148.1	2.819
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	bunch of other different problems then	1149.419	3.421
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the market cap will erode and it will	1150.919	4.561
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fall to length like 70. so when the	1152.84	4.92
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	company is sliding down from top 50 to	1155.48	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the next 50 you might catch a lot of	1157.76	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	those type of companies so there is no	1160.28	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	rational to investing because the	1161.96	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opposite rational could also be given	1163.7	3.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that you know what in Nifty next 50	1165.2	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	companies that are climbing up the	1166.9	3.639
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	rankings from let's say some company	1169.1	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	used to rank at 120 then it performed	1170.539	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	really well it jumped to 70th position	1173.0	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so that will become a part of nifteen	1175.039	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	x50 so there is no narrative that I can	1177.08	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	form right and there is no logic I can	1179.179	4.321
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	apply before investing in Nifty next 50.	1181.16	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so there is no logic therefore according	1183.5	3.419
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to me I do not invest even one single	1185.179	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	rupee there now what about flexi cap	1186.919	3.601
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds no flexi caps are what so there	1188.66	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	are large Cap Fund big company small cap	1190.52	5.1
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds midi cap funds now in flexigap the	1192.5	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund manager jumps from large cap to Mid	1195.62	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap to small cap whenever the	1197.48	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunity arises now again I will show	1198.86	4.559
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you the same data here that see right I	1201.32	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mean whether one three five year mark	1203.419	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	flexigap funds do not beat their	1204.98	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Benchmark because active investing is	1206.9	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	just bad in mutual fund opportunistic	1209.299	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	investing what I'm trying to teach you	1211.58	3.719
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it still makes little bit sense because	1213.02	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	there can be very clear undervalued	1215.299	4.201
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunities that you could sense right	1217.4	5.94
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	if Nifty is at 16 400 500 highest it has	1219.5	5.82
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	reached to 18 500 there is a very clear	1223.34	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Gap you could potentially buy it that's	1225.32	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	sensible Market timing but trying to	1227.12	4.559
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	time the market on daily basis that's	1229.88	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	impossible and sometimes I feel that	1231.679	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	flexi cap managers try to do that so	1233.72	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	therefore I avoid it now you will say	1235.64	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that okay actually we have never spoken	1237.44	3.479
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	about Medicap small caps this that right	1238.88	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	and suddenly you have become bullish on	1240.919	4.801
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	midi cab and small caps why is that the	1243.26	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	case and why are you picking the active	1245.72	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund route for investing in Medicap	1247.46	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small caps see I have built enough	1249.679	4.021
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	positions on small caps midi caps	1251.66	4.139
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	directly right I will continue to build	1253.7	5.16
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	it but I have 810 trusted stocks in my	1255.799	3.801
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	smart	1258.86	2.939
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	portfolio maybe it would be around 15	1259.6	5.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	now so those are my stocks right now if	1261.799	5.221
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I want to build like larger positions	1265.34	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	then what do I need to do now I cannot	1267.02	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	keep on scanning stocks after stocks in	1269.24	4.439
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the small cap category so therefore I am	1271.16	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	taking the active fund route now you say	1273.679	3.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that okay you will pay a lot of	1275.9	2.82
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	commissions and there will be total	1277.039	3.481
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	expense ratio would be more you'll have	1278.72	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to lock in exit load would be there so	1280.52	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	opportunistic investment will not work	1282.44	5.099
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so yes 100 agree let's see when small	1284.24	6.059
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap midicap stocks start running they do	1287.539	5.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	not run by 10 10 15 15 they run by 25 30	1290.299	5.281
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	right a year so that is what history	1293.26	4.539
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	tells us that in growth Market small and	1295.58	5.16
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	media funds outperform Nifty by almost	1297.799	5.161
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	2x that if Nifty is giving 15 return	1300.74	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	Then small and mid caps are going to	1302.96	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	give 30 return now in that if I have to	1304.94	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	pay an expense ratio of let's say one	1307.7	3.0
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	one and a half percent that is still	1309.14	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	okay but to manage large cap funds if I	1310.7	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	am paying someone one one and a half	1313.76	3.18
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percent expense ratio it does not make	1315.02	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	any sense so from that perspective I am	1316.94	4.859
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	on Medicap small cap bunch of other	1318.98	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	different reasons probably I'll make a	1321.799	3.421
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	separate video but my narrative right	1323.48	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	now tells me that small and mid caps are	1325.22	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	likely to do well again not a buying	1326.96	3.78
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	recommendation from my end please do	1329.179	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	your own due diligence own analysis but	1330.74	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that is what I'm betting on now to	1332.84	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	answer the question that okay why active	1334.88	3.659
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund route that number one I am trying	1336.74	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to time the market and I want to take a	1338.539	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	broad bet on small and mid cap but I do	1340.46	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	not have the time or energy to scout	1342.919	3.601
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	like 100 good stocks in it when it comes	1344.6	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to small and mid gaps it's mostly like	1346.52	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	VC type of portfolio investing that you	1348.5	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	go and invest in like 100 different	1351.02	3.539
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stocks and out of that maybe like five	1352.22	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will become multivathers and they will	1354.559	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	offset the loss that you are having from	1356.419	3.721
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	other 90. so that's the philosophy with	1358.039	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	which you need to operate in small cap	1360.14	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	and mid cap so which brings me to the	1362.0	3.659
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	next point that whenever I am investing	1363.86	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my money in mutual funds I have a very	1365.659	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	clear Exit Plan for example when I	1367.82	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invested my money in index funds I had a	1369.919	4.981
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	very clear Exit Plan that credit when it	1372.5	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	hit search previous all-time high I am	1374.9	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	going to book profits and move out of it	1376.82	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	then I am going to reinvest that money	1378.5	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so that was narrative one so my	1380.24	3.72
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	narrative number two right now in the	1382.34	3.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	market is that small and mid caps are	1383.96	4.199
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	likely to outperform nifty fifty over	1385.7	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	the next few years how many that depends	1388.159	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	on the market what exactly the bull run	1390.38	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	will comprise of but I have no need to	1392.179	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	book my profits for the next one two	1394.46	4.079
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	years in small cap so I'm cool investing	1396.14	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	from that particular perspective but	1398.539	3.601
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	whenever I'm betting on a particular	1400.52	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	narrative I have a very clear Exit Plan	1402.14	3.539
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	in mind that okay this is the reason why	1403.94	3.66
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I'm entering into it and this is what I	1405.679	3.541
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	feel is going to happen if my narrative	1407.6	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	change then probably I'll book a loss	1409.22	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	and get out of it but have very clear	1410.84	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	exit strategies whenever you are	1412.76	4.799
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	deciding to invest in anything so now	1414.98	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	comes Point number seven that okay why	1417.559	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	are you picking so many different type	1419.48	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	of funds that you have purchased HDFC	1421.159	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	also your personal you know follow and	1423.44	3.479
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	income under is also DSP also and you	1425.059	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	know and you have purchased 10 different	1426.919	3.061
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	types of funds okay so let me give you	1428.299	4.081
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	counter examples there was a recent scam	1429.98	4.8
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	run by access mutual fund managers this	1432.38	4.679
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	was the front running scam what is it it	1434.78	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	was just type of a scam no point in	1437.059	3.48
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	getting into all that that what exactly	1438.62	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	was a scam about probably a separate	1440.539	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	video similarly a few years back there	1442.22	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	was a crisis at Franklin Templeton so	1444.5	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that was again a company that used to	1446.72	3.18
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	run mutual fund house so the point that	1448.34	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I'm trying to drive home is that despite	1449.9	3.6
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund being a highly regulated	1451.76	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	industry scams keep on happening there	1453.5	4.559
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	so just to diversify my risk not go	1455.78	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	through the stress key that in one fund	1458.059	3.24
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	I built like crazy amount of position	1459.98	2.939
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	then I am stressing out what will happen	1461.299	3.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	with this when will I get my money back	1462.919	3.961
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	all that stuff I don't want all that so	1464.6	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	therefore I spread my money that's it	1466.88	4.2
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	second key Point many of you when you	1468.559	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invest in a mutual fund you what you do	1471.08	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is that you go on Google type best	1473.539	3.661
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual funds to invest and then you will	1475.039	4.981
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	see the returns this one gave X percent	1477.2	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	return lastly near me this one gave five	1480.02	4.019
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	percent return therefore going in the	1481.94	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	future this fund that was giving like 15	1484.039	4.321
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	return for the last three years will	1486.5	3.84
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	continue to give me 15 return for the	1488.36	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	next three years it doesn't work that	1490.34	3.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	way okay just looking at the historic	1491.78	3.96
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	returns of a mutual fund does not	1493.7	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	indicate anything about how it's going	1495.74	4.319
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to perform in the future the fund	1497.72	4.26
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	manager itself can be changed by the	1500.059	5.581
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	fund house so betting on a fund manager	1501.98	6.36
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	is a very difficult exercise I would say	1505.64	4.74
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	just diversify so that's what I'm trying	1508.34	3.9
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to do that for example if I have to	1510.38	3.779
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	invest let's say 10 lakh Rupees in small	1512.24	4.14
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	cap then I would rather invest that 10	1514.159	4.621
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	lakh money in 10 different active mutual	1516.38	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	funds of a certain size right how to	1518.78	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	pick a good small Cap Fund there are	1520.7	3.42
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	certain fundamentals I'm not saying	1522.86	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	randomly that's not the point but there	1524.12	4.799
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	should be some parameters and I'm just	1527.48	3.299
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	encouraging diversification that's the	1528.919	3.301
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	key message that I want to give now	1530.779	2.821
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	comes the last point that whatever	1532.22	3.54
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual fund you are buying it needs to	1533.6	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	be purchased in context of your	1535.76	4.56
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	portfolio so for example what I have	1537.98	4.38
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	done is that when it comes to my direct	1540.32	5.099
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stock portfolio I have already maxed out	1542.36	4.98
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my position on whatever small caps	1545.419	4.201
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	directly I wanted to buy large cap midi	1547.34	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	caps I directly wanted to buy so now if	1549.62	3.9

PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	on small caps and medicaps then my	1553.52	4.62
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	option is that now I start picking more	1556.1	3.959
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	small caps Medical perhaps directly into	1558.14	4.68
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	my stocks or if my goal is	1560.059	4.561
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	diversification then I just simply pick	1562.82	4.32
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual funds so the reason why I pick	1564.62	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	mutual funds is very simple that it is	1567.14	4.08
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	to complement whatever I am doing in the	1569.12	4.5
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	stock market it does not act as an and	1571.22	5.9

PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	that I wanted you to understand in case	1585.74	4.02
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you want to touch upon what are some	1588.14	3.539

PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	button it would allow these type of	1602.9	3.06
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	videos to reach out to more people thank	1604.34	4.4
PrpNdAHlgGI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpNdAHlgGI	you so much and I'll see you soon	1605.96	2.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Clearly, the banking system is telling
us that there's some kind of issue here.	4.37	5.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I would say, listen, that money has been
shut down.	10.67	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The banking system for the first time
really is dealing with negative deposit	14.39	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	growth year over year.
We don't see this as a systemic crisis.	17.63	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Nothing compared to 0 0 9 or 1992.
I cannot believe that what's happening	22.01	3.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in the banking sector will not if the
Fed falls in this market.	25.51	3.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is almost like the opposite of a
global financial crisis.	28.61	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And now the fears are way out there.
When the banks are more resilient than	32.1	3.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	they've been in a generation.
This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom	35.99	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Keene, Jonathan Ferro and Lisa
Abramowicz.	39.95	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What a weekend.
Live from New York City this morning.	44.42	2.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Good morning.
Good morning for an audience worldwide.	47.48	1.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is Bloomberg Surveillance on TV and
radio alongside Tom Keene and Lisa	50.65	2.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Abramowicz.
Some Jonathan Ferro features on the S&P	53.45	2.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	500 just about unchanged.
The breaking news late Sunday, the	56.09	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve
and the FDIC said it will wind down	59.9	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Silicon Valley Bank in a way that,
quote, some fully protects all deposits.	64.37	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	As we know.
The one question everyone was asking of	67.91	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	sounds over the weekend.
Where do we bank?	70.61	1.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And do we need to open a new account?
Come Monday, Morgan, open a new account	72.83	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Monday morning in general is really
important here as we are now global.	76.13	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What we have now.
John, different than the weekend	78.92	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	festivities is markets tick by tick.
To give us a score, I'm going to call it	82.4	5.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	systemic crisis Monday, as Gerard
CASSIDY talked about in the opening.	88.1	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	He will join us here, Greg Peters and
moments guy goose bumps, Greg Peters	92.03	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with us.
I mean, that's what you want to talk to	96.38	1.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	here.
But there'll be a lot of explanation and	97.91	5.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	understanding of where we are now that
the markets are open.	103.28	1.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Let's just put the stock market to one
side, capturing this stress, this	105.17	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	tension, the front end of a yield curve,
an American.	108.89	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I would go one further worldwide, have a
look at bonds this morning.	111.33	3.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	These moves are absolutely phenomenal.
On Wednesday, dates who were chairman	115.4	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	powers semi-annual testimony.
The two year yield is at five point zero	118.97	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	eight percent.
This morning, it dropped below 420.	122.24	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We've got a move this morning, least a
36 basis points lower.	126.08	3.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That is an aggressive move to kick off
the week Joel Weber over the past three	129.75	4.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	trading sessions.
The move that you've seen in the tier	133.97	1.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	rivals, what we saw back in 2001 after
9/11, that's the kind of scale of move	135.5	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that we're seeing.
So this is the question.	139.26	1.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Does what we're seeing with banking
system stress cause the Federal Reserve	143.45	1.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to materially pullback how much they
raise rates to combat inflation?	144.71	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And what does that do to inflation at a
time where that's still an issue?	148.77	3.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But the stresses of the banking system
are something that clearly the federal	152.47	3.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	government is not ignoring.
So Goldman Sachs say no hike this month	155.78	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and they've got absolutely no clue.
You can include me in this as well as to	159.23	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	what happens after March in the next few
meetings as well.	163.85	1.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The announcement this from the central
bank is equally as interesting care.	165.71	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The Fed Reserve announced the new bank
term funding program that offers one	168.86	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	year loans to other banks in America
under much, much easier terms doesn't	172.42	4.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	involve too much jargon in the early
part of the conversation, but they're	176.93	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	now going to accept collateral at park
securities that are deeply, deeply	180.05	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	underwater.
And I understand the aversion to using	184.16	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the phrase bailout this morning.
But if you are a bank that hasn't failed	186.71	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and if you have been run poorly and you
haven't managed interest rate risk and	190.48	4.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	you have this massive, Paula security
deeply underwater, that's one heck of a	195.23	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	lifeline.
The Fed is just throwing you, isn't it?	199.13	1.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They basically are keeping the
depositors whole at a time when a number	200.36	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of banks invested in assets that are
deeply underwater to a point that would	204.8	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	take deep haircuts because they don't
want to stem a fire sale.	208.94	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They don't want to sell stammered panic
a lot.	212.3	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Will this be enough to truly stem panic?
And B, what does this do in terms of	215.39	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	both the moral hazard but also with
respect to fighting inflation?	219.38	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Given that it's supposed to come from
tighter financial conditions, I would	224.3	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	partition.
Alison, as we dive into the role of	226.67	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	surveillance this morning, I would
partition it into different themes at	229.46	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	overlay.
But to the machinery that the secretary	233.15	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of treasury announced yesterday, John,
basically it's a one year repo, which is	236.3	4.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	jargon for you get a one year grace
period.	241.13	1.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And basically it's saying you guys
screwed up with your bond portfolios.	243.24	4.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Bring them in.
We'll give you 100 cents on the dollar	247.65	3.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	for one year.
They have to pay some nominal fee along	250.76	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the way.
I don't understand.	253.31	1.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But the answer is it's one year in
there.	254.66	2.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Audible here, John.
If this falls apart, they can easily	257.75	3.089
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	extend it up to two years.
That hasn't been talked about.	260.839	2.401
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's going to be talked about how much
it's done over the next several weeks.	263.39	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The regulatory snapback is going to be a
big conversation, huge about that to	266.5	2.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	some in a monster way less rich wait
through the price action.	269.54	3.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Just briefly start with equities.
Futures were elevated.	272.64	3.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They've totally faded since then.
Futures right now just about positive by	275.96	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	two tenths of one per cent on a S&P 500
has to move on a 10 year, 15 basis point	280.01	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	move on a 10 year.
But the move on a two year is just	284.33	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	phenomenal.
35 basis points lower on a two year	286.43	3.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	yield this morning, not just the story
in America.	289.44	2.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You can take a look at the bond market,
as well as calls for a 50 basis point	292.52	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	move from the ECB a bit later this week.
I guess the takeaway now is we'll see.	295.82	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We've got to move a 33, 34 basis points
lower on a chairman to.	300.71	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Yeah.
We were looking at three per cent, so	304.22	1.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	we're now at two seventy three on a
German two year.	305.81	2.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The full faith and credit monitors,
great to watch because it's clearly the	308.66	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	deepest market.
But there are the idiosyncrasies out	311.84	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	there right now, whether it's First
Republic of KLA Fournier.	315.05	3.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We've been talking about that all
morning to our major.	318.56	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But John, I'm sorry.
I mean, look at Credit Suisse here.	321.17	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Oh, buddy.
We all know this story.	323.96	1.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's a beleaguered bank caught up in
this maelstrom.	325.43	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I would like to know what Swiss
authorities do as a New York insurance	328.79	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	authorities did for signature bank with
a vengeance yesterday afternoon, along	333.26	4.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with a session on Credit Suisse to
eleven.	338.03	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The stock is down by more than 11
percent.	340.67	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right here, right now at 2 22, we're
talking about record lows for that bank.	343.07	4.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Let's start a conversation.
Greg Peters, co CEO of PJM Fixed Income,	347.9	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	joins us right now.
Greg, let's start with this.	351.65	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What you make of what's unfolding this
morning?	353.78	1.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, it's another source of volatility
in a highly volatile market.	356.89	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is not a great backdrop to invest
in.	360.88	2.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Talk about the moves and U.S.
Treasuries move in two years is	363.58	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	absolutely astounding.
And speaking of moves, the move index	367.66	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	basically almost retraced all that move
lower.	371.37	3.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That actually helped fuel the rally.
So to me, you can't have a well	374.38	5.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	functioning market with such high
volatility.	379.63	2.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Plain and simple.
Greg Peters, what would you like to see	382.51	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	from our institutional authorities?
You know, you hide it, but I believe	385.81	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	you're old enough to remember 2008.
And I remember that institutions with a	389.8	5.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	vengeance stepped up almost on a daily,
if not hourly basis.	394.87	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The president's scheduled in the 8:00
hour to speak.	399.73	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What do you need to hear from Chairman
Powell?	403.12	2.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What do you need to hear from Secretary
Yellen?	405.94	2.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, so I think this is very different.
I'm sure a lot of gas isn't the same	409.18	4.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	thing.
But I think this is very different today	414.01	1.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	than 2008 or even the SNL crisis, which
I was a part of, unfortunately.	415.54	5.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But the.
But, you know, this is not systemic, I	421.77	4.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	don't believe.
But to me, there's lots of questions on	425.77	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the table.
I think the regulatory authorities have	429.28	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to be called out here and to make it for
asset liability mismatch.	431.77	7.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Plain and simple.
Greg, it's a question that we're going	439.75	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to go through all today.
And folks, I just think it's just so	442.57	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	important.
George Shery Ahn, Deutsche Bank with a	445.39	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	sharp morning note making clear he
thinks CPI really doesn't matter	447.7	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	tomorrow.
There's so much going on in the Greg	451.97	2.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Peters world.
Greg, if that's the case, should the Fed	454.63	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	step aside?
Should it go?	459.07	1.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Alan Greenspan has suddenly become
measured or dare I say, stabilize or	461.5	5.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	lower the rate?
Well, I think that conjures up Arthur	466.81	2.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Burns.
So, no, I don't see that as a	469.74	2.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	possibility at this point.
What happened is in March.	472.08	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I don't know.
But at the end of the day, the Fed has	475.56	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to keep inflation under control.
That's the main focus here.	479.52	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So this might be a bump in the road, but
ultimately the path is clear that stress	483.75	5.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	perhaps to get inflation down.
And that's where I would focus on more	489.9	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	than anything else.
Well, Greg, a lot of the people who	492.99	2.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	right now are trying to predict what the
Fed is going to do, believe that the Fed	495.51	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	will raise one more time.
And that's possibly not any more times.	498.24	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We're looking at a Fed funds rate.
Terminal rate is priced in at four point	501.36	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	eight percent, down from nearly five
point eighty five point seven percent	504.72	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Thursday.
I'm curious from your vantage point,	508.98	2.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	where do you weigh in on this?
How do you trade this if you think the	511.41	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	market is wrong and the Fed's going to
keep going?	514.11	2.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, I think it's really cold.
That's the point here, is that the	517.84	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	volatility is so extreme that it's
really difficult to stay in any	521.53	4.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	position.
I just think about moving through here.	526.33	2.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right.
It's just astounding.	529.21	2.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I think it's really hard to take big
steps here.	531.25	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You have to be close to home.
So on the duration side, we're very	535.9	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	close to home.
We're not making large investments out	540.25	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the curve or even in the front end,
because if volatile is too extreme and	544.66	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	it introduces too much volatility into
your fixed income portfolio.	548.26	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	How concerning is it to Greg that we're
still seeing the shares of a number of	552.34	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	medium sized banks and even the largest
banks, although to a much lesser degree	555.52	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	sell off this morning even after the
programs put into place?	558.73	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Does that indicate something to you
about the level of volatility, how long	562.09	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	it's going to last and the direction it
could take?	566.38	1.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	No, I think it's more of a snap
reaction.	569.71	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think the city banks are reduced.
The banks are in a very different place	572.32	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	than the regional community banks.
I think the market will continue to suss	576.82	4.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that out.
But if you go back to Atlanta, it was an	581.68	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	outlier and almost every metric that one
could look at.	586.0	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So to me, it's far from systemic.
I think this is just a snap reaction	590.02	5.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	more than anything else.
Greg, we're looking at the yield curve	595.24	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	right now.
Typically, what we observe, the yield	597.94	1.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	curve will say things like it's steeper,
we say it's inverted.	599.65	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What's important and isn't talked about
enough.	603.37	2.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's how it's statements.
It's how it inverts.	606.19	2.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's how it flattens.
And right now it's steaming	608.53	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	aggressively, but led by the front and
now the chart.	610.33	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And Greg, as you know, people who don't
follow the bond market, they might not	612.79	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	know.
That's called the Bull Stegner.	615.49	1.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Now, Greg, when you start to see that
develop.	617.41	1.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is that a wolf in sheep's clothing for
people looking at that, observing that	619.81	3.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and saying this is great, Fed's going to
hike less.	623.03	2.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is great.
They may even cut interest rates when	625.51	1.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	you see that boosting that that
aggressive.	627.4	1.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Greg, what does that usually signal?
I think it signals that the Fed is on	629.05	6.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	precipice are coming.
I don't see that.	636.24	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So to me, the move the yield curve is
curious.	638.82	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
I still think inflation is the issue	643.14	5.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	here.
The Fed is not going to back away from	648.87	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that.
So one bank out in California having a	651.3	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	struggle, maybe a few more, doesn't
change the fact that we have inflation	655.45	4.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	still above trend here and that hasn't
come down.	660.36	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that means more hikes, not less
hikes.	662.94	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So to me, the move in the yield curve is
curious and I don't think it'll hold.	665.28	5.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Be honest, Greg, can I take it one step
further?	671.01	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	How much of this move this morning is
just about risk aversion, about taking	673.56	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	out Fed hikes?
How much of it is about people waking up	677.37	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and saying, you know what?
Not my bank deposits.	679.92	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm just gonna run into the front end of
the curve and sit here for a while?	682.56	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	No, that's that.
I think it's more of a hedge.	686.87	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right, so investors don't have a lot of
hedge vehicles out there.	690.17	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think using the two year, 10 year
treasuries do do provide that	695.01	5.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	protection.
So I think it's as simple as that.	700.1	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I don't think it's like I'm taking money
out of the bank and putting in the two	703.88	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	years.
I don't see that necessarily.	706.64	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So to me, it's just that portfolio has
trade that's going through the market	708.77	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	right now.
Let's going through the market in a	713.27	1.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	monster way.
Greg, thanks for being with us.	714.62	1.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Craig Peters, author of PJM Sixth
Income, Working Our Way Through the Bond	716.12	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Market at the moment.
But the two year yield dance, 34 basis	719.39	2.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	points.
I'll come back to this Wednesday, five	722.06	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	point zero eight per cent, Tom, this
morning for twenty three.	725.45	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think five was a record number of
people looking for 6 percent.	729.74	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But the answer is 5 percent is where
things change.	732.2	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Looking forward to the conversation in

Xi Jinping has started an unprecedented	795.1	2.94

Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This already feels like we've got a long
week ahead of us, doesn't it?	879.1	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Live from New York City this morning.
Good morning to all.	882.07	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Just tuning in, equity futures just
about turning lower negative by a little	884.86	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	more than a tenth of one per cent on the
S&P 500.	888.85	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And president said over the weekend,
everyone all together, the Treasury, the	891.22	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Federal Reserve, the FDIC.
It's been a while since we had the	894.79	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	opportunity to say that S.K.
looking to shore up the financial	898.57	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	industry in the United States of America
and do it in real time with the	902.26	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	immediacy that's needed, which is to get
trust and confidence back into the	905.83	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	system and also to begin to think about
John.	909.47	2.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Where are we heading?
What we get wrong here and what do we	912.8	2.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	need to do to fix it?
Maybe feeling a bit 2009 that 250000	915.7	4.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	dollar FDIC limit, something we just
scrapped overnight, old it was way lower	920.41	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	is an insult to hardworking upper middle
class and have a lot more than 250000.	924.43	6.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Should it be just add up, but should it
be adjusted up to 40 million?	930.55	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Because I'm on my Gulfstream from
Montana and can't decide whether to land	934.96	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	at SFO or Palo Alto.
Dani Burger to put this in perspective.	938.92	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Ninety five percent of all the deposits
at Silicon Valley Bank were above the	942.85	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	250000 insured limit because this is a
lot of smaller businesses and this is	946.84	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	where they were going to meet payroll
with right.	950.8	1.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And other banks.
It was only about a third of all	952.15	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	depositors that have accounts above
that.	955.0	1.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But you're right.
How much does this change the scenario	956.8	1.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	for banks that are regulated under a
very different set of parameters?	958.71	4.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And suddenly, what's the other side of
this?	962.92	2.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They have to pay more for that
insurance.	965.38	1.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So over the weekend, I think we all know
there was a basic question a lot of	966.82	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Americans were asking themselves whether
they need to do open a new bank account.	969.79	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Come Monday morning, a larger firm.
The idea is Sunday evening was to make	973.99	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	sure those kind of decisions weren't
made, that people would stay put, and if	977.05	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	they were made, that those banks could
ultimately meet those flows.	980.62	2.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that was the new funding facility
announced by the Federal Reserve.	985.81	0.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What we're seeing this morning, though,
is still see some single names, Lisa.	986.62	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Some of these banks still down hard in
the premarket.	989.38	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Let's draw a distinction, though, and
this is my question.	992.29	1.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I don't know the answer to it.
How much is this concern about systemic	994.99	1.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	risk and some sort of run on a bank?
And how much is it concerned about	996.85	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	profitability, banks having to pay that
much more, giving that basically telling	1000.03	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	depositors we will give you much bigger
rates, increase the deposit beta in	1004.32	4.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	order to keep your your your assets.
And then, oh, yeah, that cramps our	1009.3	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	margins, that crimped our profitability.
You would get an absolute slam 10 death,	1013.26	3.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	34 percent on a two year term, 34 basis
points, rather, on a two year, 4.5, 4	1016.78	5.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	percent on its CEO.
This morning, I'm a moveable feast on	1021.93	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	radio and television will do more data
checks here through the morning,	1025.2	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	particularly in the fixed income that
deepest of markets of the mood of the	1029.31	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	moment.
Our goal is surveillance.	1033.75	1.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	John and I talked about this over the
weekend as not only to look at the	1034.93	3.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	immediacy and the breaking news, we'll
have that for you, but also to look at	1038.73	4.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	where we're heading.
We have Thomas Michaud with us later	1043.65	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	from Keefe, Bruyette Woods.
Gerard CASSIDY will join us here in	1047.28	3.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	moments with decades of experience,
including living 2008 in real time.	1050.31	4.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And we begin this discussion this
morning on Your Future in banking with	1055.44	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Myra Rodriguez.
Terrorist managing principal at V	1059.4	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Associates.
You may not know her, but what you need	1063.45	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to know,
she is steeped in the banking discussion	1066.51	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of Washington.
Mara, thank you so much for joining us	1069.81	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in the 6:00 hour.
I'm going to cut to the chase.	1073.11	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The Republicans, led by President Trump,
are highly suspect of bank	1078.06	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	concentration.
It's Donald Trump channeling his inner	1082.44	4.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Andrew Jackson.
I get it.	1087.15	1.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Did that all go, by the way, say, say
yesterday?	1088.95	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And while the Republicans have to find
common ground with the Democrats to make	1092.49	5.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	us a one banking system.
Well, it's good to see you again and	1097.62	4.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	thank you so much for having me here.
Look, most unfortunately what's just	1102.32	4.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	happened this weekend is that venture
capital and those kinds of companies	1107.3	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	have been bailed out and this never
should have happened.	1111.62	3.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The Republicans primarily, although
unfortunately some Democrats back in	1115.55	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	2018 voted for the e.g.
RTS CPA.	1119.81	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Yes, one more alphabet soup of American
regulations and laws.	1123.08	3.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But once that vote came, men, it revoked
important liquidity and stress testing	1126.66	7.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	requirements for those banks.
Exactly around the size of what Silicon	1134.15	5.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Valley Bank is.
So, yes, Republicans should be finding	1139.85	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	common ground with Democrats now, might
provoke that useless piece of	1143.33	7.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	legislation which ended up being
incredibly damaging yet again to	1151.04	0.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	unsuspecting ordinary Americans.
Can we expand too big to fail	1151.79	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	constructively across the regionals, the
super regionals, even some of the larger	1156.49	6.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	institutions, state by state?
Or do we need to expand it for each and	1162.8	5.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	every community bank?
Yeah.	1168.02	1.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Excellent question, Tom.
No, we really need to go back to Title	1169.96	3.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	1, Dodd Frank, that was signed back in
2010.	1173.09	2.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	At that time, those institutions that
are 50 billion dollars and over weren't	1176.55	5.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	considered systemically important.
And yes, you can have domestically	1181.91	5.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	systemically important banks.
You can have the regional ones.	1187.16	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Of course, you have the ones the size of
JP Morgan, which are globally	1189.11	5.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	systemically important banks and even
these so-called smaller banks.	1194.48	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I don't call it 200 and somewhat billion
dollar institution like Silicon Valley	1198.14	5.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Bank, Small, even those kinds of
institutions.	1203.27	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We just saw this weekend how much
instability and chaos they can cause to	1206.45	6.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	ordinary Americans who didn't even know
that all of this was was going on.	1213.08	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And so those institutions should never
have been changed.	1216.59	4.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	In other words, their designation never
should have been changed.	1222.14	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, not.
Or whether they like it or not.	1224.73	1.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	ISE in Washington, D.C.
acknowledge that you're right overnight	1226.34	2.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	by using the systemic risk exception for
smaller banks.	1229.0	2.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right.
Exactly.	1232.91	0.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Unfortunately, and I really hate to be
right on this one.	1233.59	2.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Quite a number of consumer advocates and
myself for decades have been arguing	1236.51	6.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that it is important to pay close
attention to those regional banks.	1242.93	3.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	By definition, they are concentrated in
their assets and in their liabilities.	1246.27	5.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The fact that Silicon Valley was not
properly analyzing how concentrated it	1251.78	6.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	was in its deposits and some of those,
as some of you have mentioned in the	1258.62	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	previous program, were enormous.
All it takes is one or two of those tech	1263.0	4.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	companies to withdraw their default
deposits, to get on their phones with	1267.02	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	their friends, telling them, hey, I
think there's a problem at a particular	1270.95	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	bank.
And next thing you know, we had a just	1274.34	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	old fashioned run on the bank.
You also had people on Twitter who	1277.1	5.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	should have really known better.
Billionaire hedge fund managers, really	1282.5	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	fear monger, fear mongering and none of
that.	1286.49	3.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	None of that was necessary.
But at the end of the day, this is the	1290.25	4.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	fault of the executives at as VB and the
S.E.C.	1295.01	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	saying it's to investigate.
Why is it that they were selling	1297.08	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	thousands and thousands of their own
shares just a couple of weeks ago?	1300.02	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And why weren't they at least doing
minimal interest rate, risk management	1304.92	5.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and liability risk measurements?
Well, a lot of people are trying to say	1310.07	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this is highly idiosyncratic for all the
reasons that you just said.	1314.18	3.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	First Bank in California, though, shares
down almost 60 percent.	1318.08	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Comerica shares down almost seven and a
half percent in premarket trading.	1320.79	3.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is following some of the moves that
we saw last week.	1323.93	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Fifth, third.
I mean, a number of the bigger of small	1326.39	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	banks, regional banks are really
struggling.	1329.0	2.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So how idiosyncratic is this or is there
a larger problem that we're going to see	1331.31	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	come to the fore in the days ahead?
The problem is, yes.	1335.2	4.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	A couple of days ago, we could say it's
idiosyncratic, a problem is that nobody	1339.99	4.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	wants to be the last one in a room
turning off the light.	1344.97	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	In other words, as soon as there's a
problem with one bank.	1348.57	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Fear is real.
Immediately everybody starts to say,	1352.26	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	wait a minute.
Should I also have my deposits at bank	1355.32	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	A, B, C, D, etc..
So immediately investors move.	1359.01	5.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You see other banks.
Bond yields go up, which signal to the	1364.3	4.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	rest of the market that there's an
increasing probability of default and	1368.73	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	loss severity.
Even if the bank is well capitalized, I	1372.0	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	keep hearing that banks are well
capitalized.	1375.69	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Yes, the problem is they can quickly
though they can quickly become illiquid,	1378.03	6.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	which is really what matters right now.
Lehman was single day.	1384.6	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It was well capitalized, it was
illiquid, it was insolvent.	1388.44	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And these things can happen incredibly
quickly.	1391.83	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's why there is no way that Silicon
Valley Bank and other banks like that	1394.68	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	should have been allowed to grow that
fast.	1398.61	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Back in 2015, when Greg Becker was
actively advocating for lighter	1401.25	5.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	regulations in 2015, that bank was 40
billion dollars in assets.	1406.32	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	When it was closed down, it had grown by
over 400 percent to somewhere in the	1410.7	5.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	range of 200 10 billion dollars.
So, yes, you are going to see a lot of	1415.98	4.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	gyrations in the market because
investors are nervous.	1420.72	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Mara, thanks for the AMA.
This just fantastic thoughts on the	1424.23	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	regulatory front and why we're going to
go forward from here.	1426.84	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Capital Economics last night, once this
new lending facility was announced over,	1429.78	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Federal Reserve set this to shift to
accepting collateral at par rather than	1434.19	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	making marking to market means that the
banks that have accumulated more than	1438.09	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	600 billion dollars in unrealized losses
on their house maturity, treasury and	1441.87	4.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	MBA securities portfolios and didn't
hedge the interest rate risk should be	1446.76	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	able to ride out the storm.
There's always tradeoffs.	1450.87	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	These are difficult decisions, but there
is a sense that some bad management has	1454.38	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	been rewarded here.
Yes, my secretary.	1458.67	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Absolutely.
There's a five standard deviation.	1461.13	1.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You can talk about that later.
The answer is yes.	1463.14	2.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Teachers right now just about positive.
This is pulling back.	1465.42	2.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Nothing to see here looking at equity
futures.	1482.7	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Of course, there's plenty to see here.
Equity futures on the S&P 500 just about	1486.03	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	positive worst week of the year.
Last week on the S&P and on the Nasdaq,	1489.18	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	take a close look at the Russell.
The small caps in America down about a	1493.1	3.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	half of 1 per cent, second biggest
weighting on the Russell,	1496.74	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	unlike, say, the S&P.
There's a big weighting towards	1499.97	2.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	financials in there on a Russell 2000.
So keep a lookout for that.	1502.59	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Russell right now down about four tenths
of one percent.	1506.46	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Here, the fireworks.
Let's get to the bond market.	1509.04	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Take a look at the front end of a yield
curve.	1512.04	0.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Your 2 year last week, 5.0 0 8 per cent,
the highest since 2007.	1512.71	5.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We were down 20 were down.
Another 20 were down another 30.	1518.23	3.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	These moves at the front end of the
curve are just absolutely phenomenal	1522.48	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with an almost 30 basis points on a two
year to four.	1525.52	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Twenty nine, sixty nine.
That's an 80 basis point move and not	1528.4	4.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	even three full sessions.
Just amazed at the 10 year comes down	1532.53	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	about 13 or 14 basis points.
Three fifty six is seeing a similar move	1535.66	4.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in Germany.
Let's be clear about that.	1539.82	1.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	On a week where people expect the ECB to
go 50, this is what euro dollar looks	1542.07	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	like.
Euro dollar right now, whether to a year	1546.48	2.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	or down 37 points, 37 basis points in
Germany.	1548.61	3.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Euro dollar just about holding on one of
667 firmer Alisa by two tenths of one	1551.85	5.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	per cent over the weekend.
People were saying the reason why they	1557.44	3.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	came out with these programs was simply
so that they could keep raising rates	1560.55	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	without there being systemic issues,
that basically this gives them more of	1563.25	5.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	an ability to go further.
Nobody's buying that today.	1568.47	1.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We're seeing the terminal Fed funds rate
priced into the market, four point eight	1570.48	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	percent from five point seven percent on
Thursday.	1574.08	2.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Jason Kelly the conversation sort of
jump pick up on this, please, because I	1576.99	2.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	think you're dead on on.
It was yesterday.	1579.9	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There was a certain tone and then it
shifted some time when the pre Oscars	1582.02	4.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	started and it was real simple.
Nobody wanted to buy this stuff.	1586.98	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There was an assumption Sunday morning
that someone you know, we're moving our	1591.82	4.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	watches, daylight savings time,
somebody.	1596.16	1.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You'll be there.
Yeah.	1598.01	0.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And Colby Smith and James Faludi lined
up the DAX about 9:00 p.m.	1598.94	3.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	last night.
Nobody showed up to buy this stuff in	1602.88	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the weeks to come.
We'll get the color in the months to	1606.93	1.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	come.
We'll find out what happened throughout	1608.58	1.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the whole of this week.
And Tom, you've got the impression,	1610.41	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	though, that the treasury secretary we
heard from on Saturday morning on Face	1612.48	4.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Nation, what she talked about turned
out to be somewhat different to what we	1617.43	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	got later on that evening, some on the
Sunday.	1621.18	2.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We need to dive into this.
We've got many voices this morning.	1623.93	2.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	A good road.
CASSIDY and Thomas showed on banking of	1626.64	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	America coming up.
But right now, I'm incredibly qualified.	1630.12	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	GUEST Edward Yardeni is founder and
chief investment strategist.	1634.29	3.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You're doing research iconic and the
synthesis over economics in the markets,	1638.04	5.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	but far more with a passing
understanding of the James Tobin School	1643.42	5.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of Economics in New Haven, Connecticut.
Ed Yardeni joins us on Yale and learning	1648.69	4.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	from Yellen years ago, Yale.
You have known Janet Yellen from the	1653.28	6.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	very beginning.
What is her character as she confronts	1660.27	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this greatest challenge?
Well, I think she's a do gooder.	1663.24	4.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	She wants to make sure that this ends
well.	1667.26	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I think her initial remarks on Sunday
morning suggested that she was going to	1671.22	6.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	be somewhat tougher.
But once once she got sat down with the	1677.58	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	other folks who were involved in these
discussions, she came around to the view	1681.84	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that the depositors SBB had to be
protected.	1685.8	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that's exactly what what they did.
She does tend to be a government meddler	1690.03	6.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and as do other as do other treasury
secretaries and fed chairs.	1696.36	5.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And in this case, they're meddling away
at the asker for bailouts goes right.	1702.45	5.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, I'm not quite sure whether to
follow Yellen, but both maybe they they	1708.42	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	split it in the early 70s.
You talk about Janet Yellen and I	1712.41	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	remember this, folks.
He's treasured Xerox notes for those you	1716.13	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	younger, we won't explain.
But Ed Yardeni, Janet Yellen had her	1719.4	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Xerox notes.
Is there a playbook now for this trauma?	1723.39	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This one is a tough one because really
at the heart of it is the insurance	1729.1	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	system for deposits, and that's where
the problem lies.	1733.36	5.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that's why the immediate knee jerk
reaction of their regulatory and	1738.76	4.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	monetary authorities was to make sure
that depositors at these particularly	1743.92	5.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	troubled banks are able to get to their
funds.	1749.47	4.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But it still leaves a big question about
how about everybody else?	1754.54	3.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And in a sense, this is sort of a de
facto backup of the entire deposit	1758.05	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	system of the United States.
And The Wall Street Journal's warning	1762.34	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that this is the slippery,
slippery slope down to just downright	1766.54	6.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	moral hazard, where the banks get all of
their deposits guaranteed by the	1774.01	5.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	government to build on that and to build
on this point that Janet Yellen sounded	1779.26	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	very different.
Who do you expect gave her the biggest	1783.37	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	pushback?
Given all of your experience working at	1786.07	2.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Federal Reserve, at the US Treasury
Department, where did it come from?	1788.26	3.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I didn't suspect there wasn't much
pushback.	1793.14	2.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think they were in in panic mode.
I think it's extraordinary how quickly	1795.32	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	they can put out bailout programs and
come up with four letters to describe	1799.85	4.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	them.
And they did that amazingly quickly this	1804.65	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	time around.
But they've had a lot of experience with	1808.07	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	doing this.
And, you know, I think we are concluding	1810.68	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that this is the.
The payment for the free money that we	1814.16	5.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	had for so many years.
Now the feds try to tighten things up	1819.41	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and realizing that it's not that easy
and the system may need to be shored up	1823.82	5.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in order for them to make this
transition more smoothly.	1829.91	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They don't want this thing to end badly.
And	1833.0	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	we'll see the markets kind of skeptical
at first that rally on the futures	1836.9	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	markets.
Now they kind of give it all back, but	1841.28	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	it's going to be one heck of a week,
that's for sure, because we also got to	1844.46	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	remember the economic indicators before
all this happened.	1848.63	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They're worrying about the CPI.
Well, we may be worrying about the CPI	1851.9	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	again on Tuesday when it comes out.
Since this widely anticipated that it's	1855.86	4.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	it's not going to be a pretty number.
How concerned are you, especially given	1860.66	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the fact that by many accounts we've got
a hotly premarket print on on Friday.	1864.53	4.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	People shrugged it off.
They looked at wages and takes a	1869.06	2.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	confirmed narrative that really was more
convenient, especially with the banking	1871.25	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	distress.
Now we're looking to a potentially hot	1874.43	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	CPI print going into potentially 50
basis point rate hike from the ECB on	1877.01	5.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Thursday.
How does the Fed effectively fight	1882.05	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	inflation if the market is basically
telling them they're one and done at	1884.75	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this point in terms of rate hikes?
Now, I think they're going to have to	1888.65	4.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	slow down the rate hikes, may it may
even have to stop here.	1892.83	4.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm not quite sure that we're going to
have a rate hike at all at this next	1897.87	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	meeting.
Certainly it's not going to be 50 basis	1901.89	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	points and we're back to 25 basis
points.	1905.25	2.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And as you pointed out, the two year is
up and suddenly has a completely	1907.92	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	different lower terminal rate than we
had before.	1912.42	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I think that the Fed is just going to
be winging it, which is what they've	1916.29	5.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	been doing all along.
Right.	1921.57	1.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That kind of data dependent now kind of
event dependent.	1924.03	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, this is really a concern for
people who actually think that inflation	1928.21	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	is a problem and you're looking at real
yields that are plunging.	1931.36	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You're looking at financial conditions
that are easing pretty significantly.	1934.75	2.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Are you saying that you think that still
it will be effective to curtail	1937.63	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	inflation?
Are you getting more concerned about	1941.35	1.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	inflation picking up and staying higher
for longer?	1943.33	2.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, I've been thinking for a while
here that a good part of the inflation	1946.09	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	was pandemic related.
You know what?	1950.02	2.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The idea of a transitory is very
relevant to the goods part of inflation.	1953.87	4.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The persistent part of inflation has
been in services.	1958.61	3.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And we know that rent inflation has come
down quite a bit.	1962.15	2.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And then there's this kind of super core
services area that the Fed is focusing	1964.51	5.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	on.
But I think in that area, you'll see	1969.73	1.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	some moderation as well.
I sense that there's some resistance by	1971.26	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the consumers to the price increases
now.	1975.58	2.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I think there's going to be
resistance by employers to increase	1977.98	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	wages much more than they have.
At last time we spoke.	1982.42	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You sounded constructive on this equity
market.	1984.94	1.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I have to say the last six minutes.
You don't sound bullish now.	1986.86	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, it's hard to given the uncertainty
created by all this.	1990.45	4.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I have to be realistic about what's
going on, but I do think that we're	1995.25	5.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	gonna get through this.
I don't think this is going to lead to a	2000.77	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	recession.
I'm still in the soft landing cap.	2004.31	2.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I feel a lot stronger than ever in my
conviction that the 10 year bond yield	2007.01	5.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	peaked at four and a quarter percent
back on October 24th.	2012.32	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I still think October 12th was the
low last year for the S&P 500.	2016.94	4.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But my level of conviction is obviously
lower because it's unrealistic here.	2022.34	4.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I have to recognize the things that
have occurred here in the past few days	2026.65	4.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that are relevant, that change big time
in the last week.	2031.61	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's for sure.
Thank you, sir.	2034.22	1.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research.
Much more cautious time since the last	2035.6	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	time we spoke to and for good reasons.
Still thinks October, though, was the	2039.26	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	equity market like being cautious in
crisis?	2042.89	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And what crisis means is a strange word,
uncertainty, which means there's no	2045.74	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	mathematics to it.
There's no probability distribution, if	2050.0	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	you will.
That's what we call risk.	2054.29	1.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The uncertainty this morning is off the
chart.	2056.09	2.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Frankly, the president in the 8:00 hour,
I don't think is going to get it done.	2058.699	3.391
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	He's going to maybe drive it forward.
Maybe he'll have a bit of news.	2062.12	3.329
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But this is about trust in confidence.
And here's the lead.	2065.78	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's about nothing else.
We all know we all have a responsibility	2069.86	3.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to him not to talk about things like
bank runs without being super serious	2072.86	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	about what's developing in the United
States.	2076.73	1.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Goes back to the Depression.
It's not funny.	2078.59	1.859
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	At the same time, we have to observe
some of the price action that's	2080.6	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	developing in single names.
First Republic in the premarket, a	2083.12	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	stampede by more than 70 percent at the
moment, C.K..	2086.87	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They're not alone.
There's other names as well.	2090.26	1.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Credit Suisse is getting hammered over
in Europe and Switzerland.	2092.15	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But some some of these single name bank
moves this morning still.	2094.82	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	All right.
There was a hope after the moves that	2097.86	1.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	were announced yesterday that perhaps
we'd get a bounce in some of this stuff.	2099.26	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I don't see that right now.
I don't see the bounce.	2103.67	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And you need to work out the troubled
banks and they will decide.	2106.25	4.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The people in the markets will decide,
but far more.	2111.02	2.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Can you imagine the different types of
people in a more bank?	2114.05	4.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Banks in Silicon Valley like First
Republic are others.	2118.16	2.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The choice that families have in the
kitchen this morning, the choice that	2121.43	4.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	they have on the phone, they're both at
work.	2125.96	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Yeah.
The choice that a small business has.	2127.88	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm sorry.
These are not where I am.	2131.0	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	These are not big decisions.
It's like move.	2132.83	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The Wall Street Journal had a great
article this over the weekend, guys on	2135.53	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	cell phones, you know, fancy people on
cell phones jetting around the West.	2139.31	4.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And anecdotally or what they were doing
to get cajole unions out of Silicon	2144.11	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Valley.
Wednesday is payroll day for a lot of	2148.1	2.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	these companies.
They need to have the cash to meet	2150.29	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	payroll.
And that's the question that they had	2152.78	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	was are they going to be able to meet
payroll?	2155.0	2.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And it seems like what the Federal
Reserve has done, what the Treasury	2157.47	3.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Department is done is say, yes, you can.
But at what cost?	2160.88	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I think that that is what we're
trying to figure out, basically, is this	2163.68	2.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	a blanket statement we now insure
deposits or is there going to be some	2166.55	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	cost to banks for extra insurance or
potentially who could potentially bid on	2170.12	4.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	these assets and at what price?
Yeah, this morning in this week is not	2174.83	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	about the banks that are found.
It's about everyone else.	2177.41	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And to Tom's point, going into the
weekend, the number one question for so	2180.23	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	many people across this country is
whether there needs to move bank and	2183.35	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	open a new bank account.
The question we had on Friday from a	2186.62	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	market perspective was just basically
who's next, who's vulnerable here?	2190.07	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Waking up this morning after the
regulatory moves we saw yesterday.	2193.34	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Tom, the policy effort question this
morning is, have they done enough?	2196.98	2.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is that enough?
Well, what the magnitude will be, I	2200.33	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	think more than anything.
And I was sort of surprised that the one	2203.45	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	year report, the BEA,
the BATF, whatever it is, the the term	2206.69	6.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	kill on a short term funding agreement,
the new facility Mark Gurman, the new	2213.11	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	thank you.
That will go to that facility I thought	2216.74	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	was sort of small.
So I wonder if that will expand will be	2220.1	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	maybe the first measurement of magnets.
Just too many acronyms.	2223.31	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Take it with you.
It just way too much features right now.	2226.85	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Just about positive by tenth of 1
percent on the S&P and the bond market.	2230.4	3.19

In his first public comments since	2272.52	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	taking office, Premier Li Young says
China will protect the rights of	2275.94	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	entrepreneurs and continue to support
private businesses.	2279.81	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	He also downplayed the importance of
Beijing's modest economic growth target	2283.35	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of around 5 percent, saying citizens are
more focused on issues that affect their	2287.61	4.23

Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The correct statement that the banking
system is sound as a whole doesn't mean	2351.85	5.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that every bank is strong.
We are seeing the correct statement that	2357.49	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	if your bank sensitive to both and I
expressed both interest rate risk and	2361.78	5.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	credit risk, then you have a more

morning.	2381.1	1.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Good morning.
Those comments, of course, ahead of the	2382.78	1.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	weekend, Sunday, a lot announce.
We're going to go through it in detail	2384.52	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	for you throughout this morning.
I just want to give you a flavor of the	2388.21	2.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	price action.
At the moment, futures are just slightly	2390.61	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	negative, down about a tenth of one
percent on the S&P 500.	2393.34	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So far, so good.
Frankly, futures elsewhere, though,	2397.09	4.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	these moves in treasuries are just
unreal.	2401.83	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That 14 basis points on a 10 year, 355
on a two year.	2404.92	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We're down about 32 basis points to
four, 27.	2408.79	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	If you aren't just tuning again, late
Sunday evening, the Treasury Department,	2412.69	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Federal Reserve, the FDIC said it
will wind down South Bank in the United	2417.16	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	States in a way that, quote, fully
protects all depositors.	2421.66	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The hope being care, the backup, all
depositors.	2425.41	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You don't get this deposit flight from
other banks go into other places.	2428.18	3.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And if you do, hopefully the banks can
deal with that because the central bank	2431.71	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	also announced a new bank term funding
program that offers one year loans to	2435.19	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	other banks in America under much, much
easier terms.	2439.6	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Now, last night, some I think we're all
having the same conversation.	2443.5	2.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Have they done enough to prevent
contagion and to really shore up the	2446.41	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	strength, resiliency, the financial
system in America?	2450.22	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And day by day, we're going to find out.
But I think you mentioned this in the	2453.07	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	age of digital banking.
So in a world and I know the process	2456.01	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	here, that really climax concluded with
the fate of where ISE Bank has been	2458.98	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	developing over several years.
But ultimately, things unwound pretty	2462.58	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	quickly in the space of 24, 48 hours.
In a world where bank contracted 24, 48	2465.97	4.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	hours a week is a long time.
Suddenly is a word we use in the	2470.95	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	literature and the answers suddenly has
changed.	2474.22	2.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There are some really strong people out
on Twitter, John, and I would suggest	2476.59	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Jim Bianco absolutely nailed it in the
mystery of Saturday morning with a long	2480.22	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	thread.
And this is what he did and this is what	2484.84	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the great people do in law and economics
is they go to Michael Barr economic	2487.3	4.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	dynamics.
And Mr.	2492.1	2.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Bianco talked about the frictions out
there and those frictions on radio.	2494.11	5.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm rubbing my hands together.
Those frictions in the Twitter world are	2499.3	4.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	gone and the cell phone world.
Justin Smith, who worked here in digital	2503.53	4.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and founded Bloomberg Digital, told me
this is its time.	2508.36	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Cell phones are gonna change everything
with a vengeance.	2511.54	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We saw that starting Friday and banking.
Can we echo something we heard earlier,	2515.11	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the salad, some really irresponsible
tweets over the weekend, getting them in	2518.47	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	trouble.
Who really turned grandma and grandma	2522.85	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	come in here and say just highly
irresponsible?	2525.29	2.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, it's a psychology game.
So if you start talking about bank runs	2527.62	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and encouraging people to do things and
predicting Armageddon, then you	2530.56	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	undermine confidence, especially if
you're in a position of having money.	2533.5	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And there's a real question of what the
motivation of some of these financial	2536.86	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	leaders was to come out and basically
sound the alarms.	2541.12	4.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I am the son of two depression babies.
And these are things you don't talk	2546.1	5.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	about.
That's an American fabric.	2551.44	2.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Let's do this right now.
We're going to cut this from many	2553.66	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	different ways this morning.
And this is, I'm sure, from any of your	2555.61	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	controversial.
Robin Harker is professor at Cornell Law	2558.85	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	School, doing brilliant work with the
wonderful Dan Alpert and far more.	2562.09	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And Mr.
Harkin has been an extremely intelligent	2566.14	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	voice of people outside of the
capitalistic system in America.	2569.2	5.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	His service to progressive candidates in
America left candidates is noted.	2574.87	5.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Professor Harkin, thank you so much for
joining us this morning.	2580.75	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is this a progressive opportunity?
I thought it was a progressive	2584.74	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	opportunity that didn't work out.
Is this a time where progressives can	2589.09	4.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	pull capitalism a little bit towards the
people of America?	2593.65	4.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think it is.
I think it's a way that we can pull a	2599.38	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	time that we can put capitalism a little
bit more toward a sort of a rational	2601.81	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	basis.
I mean, if you start with the deposit	2605.2	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	insurance system, as you guys know,
before the changes in the law made in	2607.27	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	2005 and 2006, the deposit insurance
fund was not actually funded by premiums	2610.6	5.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	paid in by the insured parties with the
insured banks.	2616.42	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And indeed, the assessments were made
only when they essentially when the fund	2619.75	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	fell below a certain threshold, which
was a prosecutable way of doing things	2623.06	3.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	rather than a countercyclical way,
because of course, generally the fund	2626.68	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	would be going down only when banks were
actually in trouble across the board.	2629.62	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They moved about 15, 20 years, almost 20
years ago to a system that is premium	2633.76	4.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	funded, which is great.
The problem that we're living with right	2638.83	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	now is that the idea of caps on maximum
amounts that can be insured is a sort of	2641.95	5.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	relic of the free risk pricing days.
In other words, the.	2647.47	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Doesn't five days, but now.
Now that we actually are risk pricing,	2651.35	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	there's no reason not to offer it to
cover deposits in full.	2655.95	3.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	All right.
Bank provided that they pay the right	2660.22	2.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	risk adjusted premiums.
Right.	2662.73	1.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I think we can ration.
We can move to a much more rational sort	2664.56	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of deposit insurance system in that way.
And that will be, I think, very much in	2667.89	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	keeping with the wishes of progressives
on the one hand, but also I think with	2671.52	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the wishes of pretty much everybody.
Now, Robert, I want you to speak right	2674.91	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	now to a Republican group that
represents a huge body of rural America	2679.14	6.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with all that demographics.
And I state the work of you and Dan	2685.44	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Alpert on unemployment and labor and
America's truly world class.	2689.73	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I want you to speak to Republicans
who think like you, but they can't do it	2693.75	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	visibly.
How do they change their Republican	2698.37	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Party given they want representation of
depositors in America?	2702.24	4.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think maybe the best way to kind of
appeal to them is to note that we're	2708.09	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	really trying to begin a kind of
productive resurgence in this country.	2711.3	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We would like to make things again.
We'd like to make America make again.	2715.26	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And if you think about it, a bank like
SBB is kind of almost perfectly situated	2719.31	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to assist with that sort of endeavor.
After all, all of the loans were to tax	2723.81	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	startup companies, essentially companies
that might very well prove to be	2727.68	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	productive in the primary markets rather
than the secondary and tertiary markets.	2730.47	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And all of the access was invested in
treasuries.	2734.79	2.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Now, of course, it was a bit boneheaded
for the management not to hedge against	2737.43	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the interest rate risk that attaches to
the portfolio.	2741.3	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But in their defense, it's been 45 years
since we've seen rates rise this	2745.68	4.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	quickly.
And secondly, it's pretty easy to go	2750.0	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	ahead and hedge that risk going forward.
But that still leaves in place.	2752.61	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The question of are we going to insure
deposits in full of banks like this,	2756.81	5.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	given that many startup firms are newly
productive firms need big operating	2762.39	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	budgets and they can't deal with a mere
quarter million dollar bank account as	2766.86	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	their transaction account.
Just quickly, Robert, just to build on	2770.4	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	what Tom and John were talking about,
this is a new era of frictionless	2773.37	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	withdrawals and that changes the dynamic
of bank runs.	2777.03	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Does that also change the dynamic of the
regulation, of the oversight of the cost	2780.42	5.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of how much some of these banks should
have to pay to insure their deposits?	2785.64	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I hate to sound like I'm beating a
dead horse, but I think what this does	2790.68	2.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	is render more urgent.
Precisely what I'm advocating.	2793.59	2.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right.
The fact that we're now going to be more	2796.14	1.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	subject to liquidity risk because
everything moves at the speed of Twitter	2797.85	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	or the speed of the iPhone messages.
I think it's all the more important that	2801.66	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	we basically buttress the liquidity
positions of all of our banks.	2805.77	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And the way you do that is with deposit
insurance.	2809.82	1.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And again, if you price it rationally,
then you're not actually opposing any	2811.57	3.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	new costs on the taxpayer, on the public
at large.	2815.13	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You're simply essentially offering a
kind of insurance on a not for profit	2818.01	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	basis to all depositors and banks,
irrespective of how large their accounts	2822.03	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	are.
Professor, moral hazard is something	2826.23	2.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that will come out repeatedly trade this
week.	2828.51	2.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What would you say back to people that
race that particular word?	2830.58	3.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Yes.
So moral hazard, of course, afflicts all	2834.27	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	forms of insurance.
And that's precisely why we determine	2836.79	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	what the premiums are on insurance
accordingly.	2839.85	2.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right.
So one way you deal with the moral	2842.03	1.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	hazard is to charge rational premiums.
Another way to do it, of course, is to	2843.45	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	impose safety and soundness regulations.
These are kind of the equivalent of	2847.65	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	exclusions in ordinary private sector
insurance policies.	2851.46	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that's, of course, what capital
regulation as administered by the FDIC	2854.97	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	is right here.
And a lot of people don't know perhaps	2859.17	2.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that the FDIC administers a capital
regulatory regime on all banks, whether	2861.45	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	they be state chartered or nationally
chartered.	2865.71	1.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Ironically, one of the most important
ways to keep sound and safe is to make	2867.99	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	sure that your asset portfolio doesn't
have kind of crazy, risky speculative	2872.07	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	assets.
And Treasuries are essentially the gold	2875.97	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	standard where that is concerned.
Right.	2878.7	1.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So there's a great irony here in the
sense that this was in some ways the	2880.28	3.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	boring bank that people like Paul
Krugman were calling for in 2008,	2883.92	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	investing merely in loans on the one
hand, none of which were	2888.06	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	underperforming, it seems.
By the way.	2890.85	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And then the rest in treasuries, which
is just what the Fed does, right.	2893.07	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	In a certain sense, the non loan portion
of the portfolio of SPV just was the Fed	2895.95	5.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	portfolio.
The Fed can, of course, afford to deal	2901.77	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with the interest rate risk, especially
since it's doing the rate, the rate	2905.61	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	rising private sector banks can't.
They should have.	2908.58	2.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But that doesn't really mean that the
depositors shouldn't be protected	2911.55	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	against runs.
Professor, thank you for your	2914.43	1.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	perspective this morning.
We appreciate it.	2916.2	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Thank you, sir.
Rather al-Qaeda of the Cornell Law	2918.33	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	School.
Tom, a lot of people have a lot to say	2921.27	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	about that conversation.
I think they will.	2924.06	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, the poor the politics of this is
hugely, hugely engaging and they can cut	2926.34	4.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	any way.
I just go out to the simple question is,	2931.14	3.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	was this yield hog banking?
Did they just decide they wanted to find	2934.36	3.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	yield in profits or coupon versus do the
responsible thing?	2937.59	4.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Lisa, you tell me to hear you to your
maturity, 5 year maturity and not out	2941.85	4.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	past that.
And they went out past that.	2946.38	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We'll have to see what the regulations.
But the insurance like.	2948.78	2.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's my question.
A lot of people are going to say the	2951.89	2.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	same thing this morning.
These banks they haven't found didn't	2953.97	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	manage their interest rate risk
properly.	2957.09	1.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And the Federal Reserve has just given
them a big, big way out of that.	2959.61	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Futures right now just about positive.	2963.6	1.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Clearly, the banking system is telling
us that there's some kind of issue here.	2973.61	5.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I would say, Lisa, that money has been
shut down.	2979.92	2.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The banking system for the first time
really is dealing with negative deposit	2982.49	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	brought here to Lisa Abramowicz.
We don't see this as a systemic crisis.	2986.9	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Nothing compared to 0 0 9 or 1990.
I cannot believe that what's happening	2991.07	4.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in the banking sector will not be if the
Fed falls in this market.	2995.81	1.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is almost like the opposite of a
global financial crisis.	2997.79	3.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And now the fears are way out there.
When the banks are more resilient than	3001.36	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	they've been in a generation.
This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom	3005.23	4.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Keene, Jonathan Ferro and Lisa
Abramowicz,	3009.33	2.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the market fallout from the biggest bank
failure in the United States for America	3012.66	4.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	since 2008.
From New York City this morning.	3017.27	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Good morning.
Good morning.	3020.29	0.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	For our audience worldwide, this is
Bloomberg Surveillance.	3020.92	2.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	With equity futures just about positive,
my four tenths of one per cent on the	3023.51	3.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	S&P 500.
The Treasury Department, the Federal	3027.25	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Reserve, the FDIC altogether Sunday
evening announcing it will wind down the	3029.98	5.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	failed bank here in the United States
Silicon Valley Bank in a way that,	3034.99	3.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	quote, Tom fully protects all deposits,
says.	3038.02	2.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Have they done enough?
Is it a bailout?	3042.1	0.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's a raging debate this morning.
We've been covering that in our first	3043.0	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	hour here of Bloomberg Surveillance and
will continue for it.	3045.82	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm less concerned, John, about the
bailout dynamics, but about what's	3049.9	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	different on a Monday, which is we have
market data.	3053.29	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And the market data was to be collegial
green on the screen then not because of	3055.42	6.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Europe and select American banks.
And just in the last 10 minutes, we get	3061.6	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	a little bit of that 3:00 a.m.
on back, which is a constructive sign.	3065.75	4.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Let's pick up on that tension at the
front end of a yield curve in the United	3070.06	2.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	States of America and our sweaty two
year yields in America down 27 basis	3072.34	4.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	points 431.
So that's more than 70 basis points	3077.26	4.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	lower than they were from Wednesday.
That's the bond market.	3081.49	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Lisa, Tom mentioned some single names,
some of those single names, those bank	3084.13	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	stocks in America in the premarket down
more than 60 percent.	3087.1	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Yeah, First Republic Bank and looking at
Park West shares, those shares down	3090.37	4.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	about 34 percent.
I did not know that really answers.	3095.11	1.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Just don't feel like there is there is
others that are also down, but not quite	3096.97	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to that same degree or
seeing some sort of potential fallout in	3100.18	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the expectation of what other banks
could lose customer assets out of fear	3104.59	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and in a knee jerk reaction at a time
when they can do that from their phones,	3108.5	3.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	when they can do that from their
computers, triggering a much faster	3112.12	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	virtual run on the bank, that creates
potentially more issues.	3115.64	3.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We keep going back to a very simple
question that a lot of people in this	3119.44	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	country asked themselves over the
weekend, some where do we bank and is	3122.74	3.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that bank big enough heart of the man to
we need to open a new account this week?	3126.4	3.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, oh, no new account and also
multiple accounts.	3129.43	2.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think the whole 250000 statistic has
been shattered.	3132.11	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It was shattered in 2000.
It will address a theme.	3136.15	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Thomas?
Sure.	3138.91	0.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	DAX joining us is definitive on this.
But John, I really think everyone's	3139.27	4.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	resetting.
And it's not just a simple one.	3144.22	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	iPhone move.
It's multiple decisions.	3146.95	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	These were clearly quick decisions over
the weekend, quick decisions to try and	3150.17	2.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	stem the fallout from Silicon Valley
Bank and other names as well.	3153.06	3.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But the regulatory fallout, Lisa, the
consequences, the follow through, the	3157.42	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	snap back, even some of the things that
were unwound five years ago.	3160.72	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's where the conversation is going
to be in a few few weeks ahead of us.	3163.24	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The next few months as well.
Some people are saying, are we back to	3166.57	1.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	quantitative easing?
Right.	3168.43	0.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And then all of a sudden you have a
pricing in and no rate hikes are just	3170.3	2.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	one more and then rate cuts later this
year.	3172.75	1.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The policy response being saved, the
financial system at all costs.	3175.93	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Then what's the moral hazard?
And that's going to be discussed for a	3178.66	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	very long time.
There is also a larger question of the	3182.23	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	interconnectedness of venture capital of
some of these banks who grew by so	3185.68	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	quickly and then didn't know what to do.
The duration, the fact that the risk is	3189.4	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in the safest assets.
Right.	3193.24	0.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The duration risk that has come to the
fore.	3194.05	1.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	All of these questions has raised more
concerns about what's the next shoe to	3196.24	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	drop in a significant way.
Math doesn't work here this morning or	3200.05	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	so much emotion going on.
But I did a lot of fancy math.	3203.5	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And the answer is in on that Thursday,
in August of 0 7, John Labor always was	3207.16	5.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	a four standard deviation move and that
was considered outrageous.	3213.04	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The move of a 10 year bond in recent
months has been over five standard	3217.24	6.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	deviations.
And that was the shock they had, quote	3224.02	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	unquote, managed.
So the Federal Reserve is in a quiet	3226.48	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	period now.
No Fed speak on the calendar whatsoever.	3228.7	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We have CPI coming up tomorrow.
We have retail sales after that.	3232.69	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The final piece of Fed speak in the
Financial Times with Kobe Smith.	3237.58	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The final piece of it was after the
session on Friday with the Richmond Fed	3241.17	3.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	president Tom Barkin, who refused to
rule out a 50 basis point move, said he	3244.87	5.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	was open to it, wouldn't rule anything
out.	3250.69	0.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So we're still talking about rate hikes
from the Fed speak a last week.	3251.72	4.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Now, I think a lot of people woken up
this morning and come to the conclusion	3256.3	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that everything's changed.
We won't get a move.	3260.11	1.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	When the young Hatzius camp over at
Goldman, I would say we've still got	3261.83	3.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	some data.
This week's more important information	3265.57	1.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	still to come.
I am personally, I'm in the camp that	3267.13	2.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	there's still value to the Tuesday.
It's Tuesday.	3269.8	2.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Road CPI is.
Flirtation a date.	3272.08	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There's others, a surveillance at
Deutsche Bank just pushes it aside.	3275.5	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But I will say that I got and you get me
in so much I can't send you the	3280.39	5.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Newtonian vector of the ten years that
funny of the Newtonian vector transit	3285.84	5.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	fed funds rate was irresponsible.
It was not what they did.	3291.88	5.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It was the speed, the x axis that they
did.	3296.92	3.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It totally unprecedented and I'm sorry,
very non Greenspan.	3300.34	4.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I think the the anniversary of the
first hike is on the 16th I believe,	3305.53	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	which is Thursday 0 2, close to 5
percent in twelve months.	3309.16	4.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And you're saying you're saying that's a
mistake.	3313.84	1.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I know the phrase that they use is slow
rate is one example of this from	3315.67	4.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	engineering.
The bottom line in this is simple.	3320.65	2.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They move too fast.
That's it.	3322.86	2.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The magnitude of getting from here to
there.	3325.81	1.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I've talked like a main guy.
Juliette Saly Cassidy's coming on.	3327.16	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It works from here to there.
That's fine.	3330.37	2.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But in hindsight in some are suggesting
along the way it just took too long.	3333.22	5.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's the issue.
They moved so fast because it was such a	3340.18	1.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	loss.
Yeah, that's so many.	3341.97	1.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They had like ketchup and indeed the
silence of the Fed.	3343.97	3.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Maybe they break the rule today.
Maybe you should hear from Chairman Paul	3347.35	2.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	today.
No.	3349.87	0.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We'll see.
We'll see.	3351.29	2.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Let's get to our bets here.
The deputy CEO of a fixed income of a	3353.77	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	new tech opponent.
Ashoka, I just want to start this May in	3357.76	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Treasury market, this summit to
discuss with you what you make of this	3360.85	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	move over the last three days on a team.
Gale, just aggressively lower.	3363.31	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, market, as you guys are talking
about, I mean, it's taken out, you know,	3366.7	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	any chance of them going 50?
You know, in the next meeting we're down	3371.17	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to now, we're kind of debating and we're
pricing 0 versus 25.	3375.55	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I think that's very, very rational
at this point.	3379.6	3.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think the Fed, you know, they got a
relatively weak wage number on payrolls,	3383.86	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and I think they're probably hoping
they're going to get a zero point two	3387.85	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	CPI and then they have the economic data
to justify this.	3391.72	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But I do think the Fed is going to be
looking at this as this is a quasi	3397.84	1.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	permanent tightening of financial
conditions.	3399.1	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is unlike the tightening of
financial conditions they've been	3401.5	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	generating in the last year or so, where
it's been more stock market driven,	3404.74	3.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	dollar driven, you know, tradable
financial market variables.	3408.46	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And it's going to be something that is
going to impact the real economy.	3412.42	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Extent is unknown.
So I think they will have more comfort	3415.44	3.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in the idea that the economy is going to
slow and that they can slow the pace	3418.45	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	IBEX pretty quickly.
How much does that completely reset a	3422.59	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	shock, what you were expecting and the
way it even arranged your portfolio at a	3425.8	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	time of very high volatility?
Well, we've been thinking that the peak	3430.12	4.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of Fed hiking was in sight.
Now, that was more driven by a view that	3435.05	3.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	inflation was going to be coming off and
start coming off pretty quickly.	3438.22	3.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Then the idea that we were going to have
a 48 or 36 hour banking crisis.	3441.34	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I think the idea is that, you know,
the market is is trading and the bond	3447.31	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	market right now of a little bit of more
pressure and credit spreads of steeper	3451.66	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	yield curves of range bound rates.
I think kind of if we'd gone to the end	3455.53	6.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	point for a different reason for how
this was likely to play out.	3461.95	1.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think from here, you know, we
obviously have the banking issues.	3463.94	3.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think, you know, the credit markets
are are, you know, a widening in credit	3467.62	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	spreads.
We're not going to see what we've seen a	3471.88	3.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	lot of the last two years where spreads
can have a very quick snap back from	3475.12	2.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	these widening events.
We're likely resetting to a little bit	3478.01	4.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of a higher higher income and spread
level.	3482.14	1.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I would expect the Treasury market
to, you know, to be bought, not sold on	3483.89	6.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	any dips.
Sarah, would you have to expect a higher	3490.39	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	rate of defaults as a result, corporate
defaults because of this question around	3493.69	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the access of capital at investing in a
company that could be more intimately	3496.9	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	tied to what we're seeing right now?
Well, I don't want to be super negative	3501.1	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	here because corporate America is in
pretty good shape as a law, as a	3505.45	5.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	statement.
Now, we're coming from an environment of	3511.04	3.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	one point six or so default rates, maybe
2 percent default rates and in high	3514.12	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	yield markets globally.
So we're starting from a very low point.	3518.53	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So part of it is, you know, it's it's
going to be a lot harder to get lower	3521.56	4.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	from from that.
But I do think this rate shock, which	3525.79	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	we've now seen and in a bank and a
levered financial institution, our	3530.26	5.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	expectation is that this rate shock, you
know, over the coming quarters, there	3535.87	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	are going to be some impacts into the
real economy and corporate America shirt	3538.58	4.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with the independence of Neuberger
Berman.	3543.46	1.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I can ask this with great respect
because Neuberger Berman folks lived the	3545.44	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Lehman moment.
They were private.	3549.52	1.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They were August.
Mr never built this out for years.	3551.86	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And then they were taken out by Lehman
in 0 3 or 4 ish and blew up in a shock.	3555.82	5.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Your team live this.
There's no other way to put it.	3561.19	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Should we fear the big banks if we are
going to get new bank concentration?	3564.37	5.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is that something unfair to Americans?
Well, there are so many questions	3570.07	4.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	wrapped up in that.
I would say first the US needs like	3575.05	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	small banks, regional banks mean the
market's focus is on the regional banks,	3579.49	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	but we've got a lot of in our country
doing local bank lending against real	3583.69	4.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	estate and small business.
That's important now.	3588.58	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The challenge is they're not under the
same regulatory framework that the big	3591.55	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	banks are.
But I do think, you know, this this is a	3595.42	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	lot different than 0 8 0 8 was about
bank collateral.	3599.32	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That was either not not, you know, not
worth anything or a lot of opacity	3603.04	6.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	around where it should be valued.
You know, by and large, our expected	3609.43	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	expectation view is that bank loan books
are not in terrible shape.	3613.6	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They're in pretty good shape.
This is now.	3617.11	2.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is more of a psychology and a
deposit flight issue.	3619.33	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's more of a traditional bank run type
of issue than it is a solvency issue.	3622.69	5.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That was what really defined a lot of
the 0 8 crisis.	3628.3	2.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And in some ways that makes it a little
bit easier to solve.	3630.94	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But it is also more in what you were all
talking about, the psychology of how	3633.85	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	capital is moving right now.
It's just amazing.	3638.23	1.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Some things don't change.
Just an old fashioned bank run taking	3640.18	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	down an institution.
Asha Patsy of that new pachyderm in	3644.14	2.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Asia.
Thank you.	3646.78	0.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Morgan Stanley, Mike Wilson just
published two months ago.	3647.98	2.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I saw the headline Lincoln Vampire
Lacks.	3650.17	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I hear the quote this past week
witnessed the sudden collapse of SVP.	3653.11	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The real story for equity markets is the
impact of the Fed's actions over the	3657.37	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	past year.
Some to your point, earnings growth	3660.61	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	expectations remain materially too high.
Markets are now likely to price that	3662.86	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	risk more quickly.
Is the setback in a way, good news when	3666.58	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Fed's backing away for the wrong
reasons?	3670.57	1.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The way they do it is absolutely right.
They're going to do it for the wrong	3672.55	2.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	reasons that they got this wrong and
that they're going to verbal this.	3675.46	3.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I don't think the usual Fed speak to her
is going to get it done.	3678.85	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is where the chairman has to come
out with clarity and state the new	3682.3	4.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	vision.
That's a real challenge ahead for	3687.04	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	chairman.
It's a single issue monarch.	3689.29	1.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I know that.
But there is some news.com again beneath	3691.36	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the write down that I need to stay on
top of this from the Wall Street	3693.73	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Journal.
Just months ago, China's leadership to	3696.61	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	speak with the landscape
and meet next week with Putin, so to	3699.49	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	speak with the landscape.
Meeting with Putin, which we know, which	3703.78	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	we knew already and this time.
This comes at a time when last week	3706.9	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	hardly talked of earnest, hardly talked

Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm Lisa Mateo and this is Bloomberg.	3819.89	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Almost all of our bank failures during
the great financial crisis, we had about	3835.18	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	400 of them.
We did purchase an assumption we sold	3839.32	2.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that failed bank to a healthy bank.
And usually the healthy acquirer would	3842.04	4.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	also cover the uninsured because they
wanted the franchise value those large	3846.91	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	depositors.
So optimally, that's the best outcome.	3850.99	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The problem is this was a rushed this
was a liquidity thing.	3854.35	1.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It was a bank run.
So they didn't have time to prepare to	3856.4	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	market.
The banks are having to do that now and	3859.22	1.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	playing catch up.
It all came together very quickly.	3860.92	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That was they put in a sheet about the

Good morning.	3868.93	1.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Here's a flyer for the price action
right now.	3870.46	1.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Equity futures on the S&P 500 positive
by a half of 1 percent.	3872.38	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The move in the bond market just
absolutely phenomenal.	3876.14	2.7

Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Get a break of that a little bit earlier
on this morning.	3887.21	2.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Much, much lower than that, actually.
We've come down from north of 5 percent,	3890.23	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	some to 430 in two and a bit trading DAX
in America.	3893.59	4.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Just unbelievable.
Off the radar.	3897.61	1.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Brent crude 81 71.
For Brent crude to break 8 0.	3900.1	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Eighty would be a huge deal.
We're not seeing that yet.	3902.93	3.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But there are some correlations out
there amid the trauma.	3907.06	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I want us to just John, having Sheila
Bair on Meet the Press on Sunday was	3909.82	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	absolutely brilliant.
I spoke to her.	3913.84	0.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It seemed like we spoke about every two
weeks.	3914.53	1.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It was less than that.
But that's the way it was in the crisis.	3916.66	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is someone, an academic out of
UMass.	3920.06	1.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	She was a Bob Dole acolyte of Kansas,
and she found generationally understands	3922.32	5.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	small banking in America.
She lived with Bob Dole, the early part	3927.97	5.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of the SNL crisis.
She would get to the deposit insurance	3933.28	1.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	top 50 debt limit anymore.
It's that debt up.	3935.26	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is that.
It was like that was my amateur because	3938.23	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	it's done and it should have been higher
to begin with.	3940.81	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I thought it was artificial.
I mean, it just depends what the price	3943.65	2.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	is going to be for that insurance.
Right.	3946.36	1.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	How do you determine that if it's not
250?	3948.05	1.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is it free insurance as much as you want
in terms of whatever do you have in	3949.77	3.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	terms of your deposit account in the
Archie issue?	3953.44	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Here to get to our next guest is.
We've done the data check Jonathan Ferro	3957.07	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	here briefly at the moment.
It's time to talk about.	3959.24	2.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Come back to you later and we'll come
back to it later in.	3961.42	2.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What is so important here is what it was
so different in the time of Bob Dole	3963.72	4.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	money market funds.
Gerard CASSIDY joins us now, as he did	3968.01	4.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	on Friday, I believe it was.
He is with RBC Capital Markets, an	3972.34	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	absolutely definitive and the fabric of
American banking is that all this is	3976.96	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	about, Gerard, the Reserve Bank, you and
I, one day we're sitting over a cup of	3980.56	4.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	coffee at that little coffee shop by
government center in Boston.	3985.33	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	He said, what the hell is that money
market fund?	3988.91	3.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Now, we know is that all this is about
is the fear of bank deposits moving to	3992.48	5.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	money market funds.
Tom, thank you for having me on the	3997.78	3.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	program again, and I think that's
definitely part of it.	4001.7	2.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And you have a very good memory because
when the Reserve Reserve Fund broke the	4004.49	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	buck, the Fed immediately came out and
guaranteed all of the money market	4008.93	4.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	mutual funds to instill confidence in
the money market, mutual fund industry	4013.46	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	back then.
Today, of course, because of what's	4017.76	2.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	happened with Silicon Valley Bank.
And then yesterday, of course, signature	4020.63	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	bank.
There's not a lot of confidence by	4023.81	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	depositors to keep the large depositors
over the deposit limit, to keep their	4027.14	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	deposits in the bank.
However, the action that was announced	4031.64	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	yesterday by the Fed, the U.S.
Treasury and the FDIC should give all	4034.76	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	depositors confidence that their
deposits are insured well above the June	4039.14	4.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	fourteen thousand dollar limit that you
guys addressed.	4043.73	2.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I think it's going to take some time
to cool down.	4046.31	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Certainly a lot of uncertainty, a lot of
fear is showing up in the bank stocks at	4049.89	4.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the opening.
So it'll be a really bumpy, rough day	4053.93	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	today for bank equities.
It's not half in the bank stocks in the	4056.72	2.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	free market.
I think that's what stands out for a lot	4059.39	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of people here.
Do you think what they've done	4061.19	1.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	overnight, yesterday evening is
sufficient to prevent the deposit flight	4063.29	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	from small, medium sized banks in
America to the ISE Sybase?	4067.67	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think it is, John, but it takes time
for the message to get out there.	4072.49	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	All of us obviously are very zeroed in
on this.	4077.02	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We do it for a living.
We look, eat and drink this stuff every	4079.84	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	single day.
But the regular folk, not so much.	4083.41	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So as a result, I think the message has
to get out there stronger to reassure	4086.74	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	everybody in the community.
Banks have to obviously reach out to the	4091.0	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	smaller regional banks, reach out to
their customers and point out that	4094.24	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	they're very well capitalized.
The banks are profitable.	4097.81	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is not a credit problem.
And as you guys know, this is a problem	4100.66	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with the bond portfolios being upside
down.	4103.93	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And John, I liked your comments about
what the 10 year government bond yield	4106.42	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	is doing.
Great.	4109.66	0.659
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Now it shrinks any unrealized losses
because of the strength in the bond	4110.529	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	market, such as the Treasury Department,
the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, as you	4114.939	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	know.
But for those people, just chain, again,	4118.569	1.801
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	who haven't been maybe following this
closely, have wine down these	4120.399	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	institutions, they're looking to do that
and quite fully protect all depositors.	4123.729	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Judge, we're trying to work out the
profit channel, share that net net	4127.93	2.969
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	interest margin story, how much the
small banks will have to pay up for	4130.899	3.091
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	those deposits, how much they'll have to
raise interest rates, where it leaves	4133.99	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the major lenders I've awakened.
I was thinking about this job.	4137.2	2.409
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	If I'm a major bank right now, b, if A
JP Morgan, I was expecting deposits just	4139.66	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to line up at the door, no matter what
the interest rate was on them, would	4144.13	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	just open accounts for you.
I will give you say it right.	4147.64	2.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You not a safe bet.
How is that going to change in the	4150.04	2.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	coming weeks?
John, you're bringing up a very good	4152.08	4.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	point with the larger banks.
If the depositors are moving to them for	4156.64	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	safety, the concern about deposit bait
is going up for the biggest bank.	4161.26	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Banks may actually go into reverse
because, as you said, they don't need to	4164.95	4.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	maybe pay interest if somebody is moving
there for safety.	4169.81	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But you're right, on the smaller banks,
they may be required to pay up for	4173.01	4.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	deposits due to the fact that there's
this uncertainty.	4177.76	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And again, it's obviously a very
volatile time today, probably for the	4181.39	5.219
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	next couple of days.
But we do expect this to come down.	4186.609	2.491
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I think the Fed and the FDIC and
Treasury came out very clearly.	4189.189	4.561
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So they're saying that deposits, you
know, over 250 at those two banks that	4193.84	5.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	fail will be fully insured.
And that implication to me is that all	4199.06	4.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	bank deposits now are insured to an
unlimited amount for the time being and	4203.65	4.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	try to make a lot of people would share
that.	4208.19	1.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You talked about how you do expect this
to calm down in the process, though	4211.09	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	there could be some significant bumps
along the way.	4213.88	2.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm looking right now.
Credit Suisse default swaps hitting a	4216.34	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	record.
Those shares falling to a record low as	4219.19	3.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	people probably imagine the fallout
hitting some of the weaker players.	4222.19	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	How many more casualties do you see now
than, say, on Friday, as you see the	4227.08	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	reaction with respect to depositors,
with respect to.	4230.92	2.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right.
Regulators not being able to stave off	4232.96	1.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	some of the concern and markets.
It is a good question because you know	4234.94	5.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	what they came out with the firepower on
deposits is quite strong.	4240.21	4.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And so some of the stocks that are down
the most today have plenty of access to	4244.77	4.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	now.
The Fed's lines as they announced	4249.93	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	yesterday.
We also have to remember that they have	4252.99	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	federal home loan bank advances that
they could tap.	4255.93	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that was part of the reason what
happened last week when Silicon Valley	4258.54	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	was the speed in which it happened.
I mean, it is amazing that 3 city, 9	4261.96	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	p.m.
on Wednesday, everything was OK.	4265.8	2.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And by early Friday morning, that bank
was out of business.	4268.44	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We've never seen anything that fast in
our careers.	4271.08	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And so now these other companies have
time to tap lines.	4273.96	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Now they have the new lines.
And that should really stave off the	4277.56	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	fear or handle any deposit disruption
deposit run that they may feel today and	4280.41	6.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	tomorrow.
They have access to plenty of money to	4286.47	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	be able to handle those withdrawals.
And listening to the word bailout over	4288.9	5.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the weekend, it seems to be so
emotionally charged that no one really	4294.09	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	wants to go with that.
But, Chad, I just wonder from your	4296.94	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	perspective what you've just mentioned,
this new bank term funding program, the	4299.37	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	feds offering?
Well, I mean, that collateral basically	4302.97	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to come in at par when some of these
treasuries are deep, deep, deep, deep,	4306.39	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	deep underwater.
They've mismanaged interest rate, risk	4310.74	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	shot.
We talked about that now for the last	4313.29	1.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	week.
How much of a lifeline is that for those	4315.03	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	poorly managed institutions?
John, you're right near on this security	4317.46	4.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	is not going to be a place that are
they're going to have this program run,	4322.22	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	as the Fed said, seriously, at least
until March of next year.	4326.66	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I think if they still need some
assistance, we would.	4330.8	4.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I would anticipate the program extended
into 24 if it needs to be.	4335.09	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So it's really going to come down to a
matter of building up equity in the base	4339.5	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	over the next 12 months and then
possibly selling some of these	4343.88	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	underwater securities, taking losses
that they can handle and then moving	4347.57	4.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	through this problem.
Time will solve this problem.	4352.1	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And with this now program, I think
you're going to find that the banks are	4355.13	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	now being given time to solve this
problem by growing earnings through	4358.67	5.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	normal banking operations and possibly
over time taking some of those	4364.04	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	unrealized losses, the losses, and then
eliminate the problem completely.	4367.79	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Joe CASSIDY, thank you, sir, from RBC
Capital Markets on this financial	4371.69	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	situation, some in our debt.
Take care.	4376.16	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We talked about this earlier and you
said that funding program, that facility	4378.5	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	from the Federal Reserve, you expect it
to be extended.	4383.06	2.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I thought of Carl Weinberg a lot this
week, and he wrote a brilliant note for	4385.97	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	High Frequency Economics this morning.
He's someone expert in what do you do	4389.09	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with Greece?
What do you do with Ecuador?	4393.14	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Gerard CASSIDY, you know, six banks that
are in Ecuador this morning that we're	4397.04	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	not even talking about.
He he's literally that encyclopedic.	4400.7	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And the answer is you put up cash, you
extend time, almost extend and pretend	4404.21	5.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and you set up a gift of an interest
rate while you catch up to it down the	4410.57	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	road.
It's no different than a debt work out	4414.17	2.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of Ecuador.
Well, I don't mean to pick on Ecuador.	4416.18	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm with you.
It's one heck of an announcement from	4418.97	2.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Federal Reserve yesterday evening.
CSM Credit Suisse, Lisa, mentioned that	4421.13	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the equity is down 10, 11 percent.
This is pulling back.	4425.21	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's like the market never really closed
on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, just	4439.98	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	waiting for that news from authorities
here in the United States.	4444.48	2.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Let's get to the price action for you
briefly on the equity market on the S&P	4447.99	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	500 positive, a little more than a tenth
of 1 percent.	4450.6	2.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	A snap back on the NASDAQ positive,
eight tenths of one per percent, a heavy	4453.15	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	weighting towards the financials on a
Russell.	4457.35	1.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Be wary of that.
We're down about half of 1 percent on	4460.74	1.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Russell futures.
But here's the why for the Nasdaq.	4462.72	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I guess we can talk about this later.
Look at this move in the bond market to	4465.26	4.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	sense that ease your two year yield
aggressively lower down by 34, 35 basis	4469.47	6.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	points, 423 43.
That move is from a level of north of 5	4475.62	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	percent, north of 5 percent from
Wednesday.	4480.03	3.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Share power day to a testimony.
I just wonder if Chairman Power had his	4483.84	3.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	his second go, his third go, his fourth
go at testimony this morning.	4487.18	3.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	How different that testimony might be.
Goldman Sachs out earlier May.	4490.35	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Some young Hatzius say no hike, no hike
this month and no clue what happens	4494.52	4.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	after that.
It's a parlor game and I guess it plays	4499.29	1.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	off 830 tomorrow morning, 25 hours from
now.	4500.97	3.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Do we do an inflation show or do we do a
banking show?	4504.57	3.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And my guess is we're still going to be
doing a banking show with a little bit	4507.84	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of an event that's perhaps bigger than
Jobs Day was on Friday.	4511.44	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	If you remember that for the first time
in twelve months, this Fed will not have	4514.68	4.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	a singular focus on inflation.
There'll be something else to think	4519.48	1.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	about on a
constitution was a wrong word.	4521.37	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But on a foundational basis back to 1913
and the Federal Reserve Act.	4525.24	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This completely overwhelms monetary
policy.	4529.8	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Does it change things for the ECB in
quite the same way?	4534.06	1.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Look, this move on a chairman to you
this morning.	4535.65	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We are lower by thirty seven basis
points at the front end of the German	4538.23	5.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	curve on a day where people expect the
ECB to go 50.	4543.99	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Now, I guess the question is, it's not
the 50 this week.	4546.9	2.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We'll see if they go.
I would point to is the what next?	4549.27	2.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What's what's coming later.
You're the expert on this side	4551.94	3.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	pontificate that this fiercely upgrades
the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, view	4555.07	6.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the ECB.
Fierce, I would say, the wrinkle here at	4561.21	3.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Governing Council meeting coming up
this week.	4564.88	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's not about the 50 basis point move
that basically precommitment term.	4568.0	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We'll see if they follow through on it.
The conversation would have been do we	4571.57	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	need to pre commit to a 50 basis point
move after this one?	4575.14	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Given the uncertainty in the financial
sector over the week, at least given	4578.02	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	what's developing at the moment, I think
it was going to be very cautious to pre	4582.04	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	commit to anything.
Remember, before we had the banking	4585.73	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	crisis, we were looking at this huge
divergence of people who thought that	4588.67	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	there was disinflation and those who
thought that weak had prevented	4592.72	3.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	potentially new peaks and inflation
ahead.	4595.78	2.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Where has that discussion gone?
Do people think that inflation is low	4598.3	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and no longer a problem?
There's been enough of a natural	4601.15	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	tightening in financial conditions to
eliminate the risk of inflation to the	4603.37	4.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	same degree.
I think it's a real question and that	4607.93	2.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	would be good news.
I think at the moment the bad news is we	4610.09	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	have real policy conflict on our hands.
If we solve the inflation issue and they	4612.94	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	were sufficiently satisfied with
developments and said, okay, far enough,	4617.56	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	we sent things break.
I'm not sure that's the case at all at	4622.21	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the moment.
Something this is still a worry on this	4625.18	2.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	FOMC, on the ECB Governing Council that
they haven't done enough.	4627.46	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Inflation is still too elevated and this
financial stability concern as has	4631.93	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	surfaced at the well, that's at the
right time.	4636.01	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Everybody's got an opinion and I would
suggest our opinions wait for the	4638.35	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	president, the United States, and I
assume we'll get follow on from	4641.32	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Secretary Yellen.
Then maybe we get an unusual statement	4644.53	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	from Chairman Paul.
I do think that this is going to be the	4648.4	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	key question, this policy conflict and
how it gets resolved and how they signal	4651.01	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that.
I just want to take a look at some of	4655.27	1.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the banks that are getting the most
effected ahead of the open on the	4656.56	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	smaller to regional size banks.
We talked about First Republic, those	4660.04	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	shares down more than 60 percent at one
point, down more than 70 percent this	4663.16	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	morning ahead of the open western
alliance, down 47 percent, 49 50.	4666.76	5.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, you could just see the law says
building as we move forward, pack West	4672.46	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Bank Corp.
Those shares down more than 30 percent.	4676.39	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I include Bank of America because
the big banks have really been isolated	4679.06	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	from some of these moves.
Right.	4682.78	1.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You're seeing basically flat in
premarket trading for the likes of JP	4684.35	3.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Morgan.
Bank of America has been hit harder than	4687.64	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the others.
And I wonder to your point, John, how	4690.52	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this makes sense.
You made a great point about if people	4693.25	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	are worried about putting their money in
some of these smaller regional banks,	4696.01	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	don't the big banks win?
Don't they basically don't have to pay	4699.37	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	anything for themselves?
Because they're safe?	4702.85	2.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, then what's the argument?
And some of those banks, this is a	4705.1	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	deposit issue where they've got to pay
up for it.	4708.28	2.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is it a profitability issue as potential
exposure in the hall of maturity buckets	4710.35	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	for some of these banks?
Well, authorities have basically come	4715.03	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	out in the last 24 hours and said all
deposits are insured.	4716.83	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Correct.
Based on the failure of these banks over	4720.4	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the weekend, which begs the question
we're asking this morning, have they	4722.65	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	done enough?
Have they done enough to basically tell	4726.1	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	everyone who is asking a question over
the weekend, do we need to move bank	4729.61	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	accounts?
The answer this morning for the	4732.46	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	regulator for official should be no, no.
It should be no.	4734.41	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So begs the question, why are we seeing
what we're seeing right now?	4738.01	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The other issue, the Federal Reserve has
opened up a new funding facility for	4741.4	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	banks to say, yes, I know you've got
these securities that are deep, deep,	4744.79	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	deep underwater.
But guess what?	4748.33	1.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You can post that collateral with us
apart and we'll give you this cheap	4749.71	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	funding that's going to be great for
you.	4752.68	1.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So you should be able to stem the tide
as well.	4754.36	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Have they done enough?
Let's see where we are.	4757.18	1.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	On the end of the day, I've got
absolutely no idea.	4758.62	1.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But I think some people are surprised by
the magnitude of the move in these	4760.3	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	single names given what was announced
yesterday evening.	4762.82	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I would agree.
I think that people think if the	4765.52	1.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	government is backstopping these
deposits, should there be some sort of	4767.5	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	relief in markets that we're not seeing?
I will argue we are seeing the systemic	4771.07	4.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	interconnectedness in a way that is new
for this cycle.	4775.87	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I think about, for example, a stable
coin that broke the buck because its	4779.11	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	assets were parked at Silicon Valley
Bank.	4783.25	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, this sounds esoteric, but it's
not.	4785.98	1.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It highlights sort of the connected
tissues of a market that had been	4788.08	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	inflated by a decade of low rates.
Michael Scheuer joins us right now.	4792.1	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	He's the chief executive officer of
Market Fuelled Asset Management.	4795.67	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And far more incredibly, you stood out
of a blue Manchester, the University of	4798.64	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Manchester United
in accounting and technology.	4803.11	3.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	He joins us this morning.
Not a day to talk football.	4806.9	2.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The other day, I want to be delicate
here.	4809.98	2.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We all learned in high school that one
of the great things that provides	4812.59	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	liquidity within our system are people
without hysterics, looking long to buy	4816.58	5.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	something with enthusiasm and some time
to establish a trade of looking for the	4821.59	4.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	price to go down in shorts, market
fueled as claimed, for shorting banks.	4826.36	5.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I don't want to get into individual
securities specifics, but do you sustain	4831.49	4.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	shorts today in banks?
You know about that.	4836.41	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We don't know about.
Or do you just step aside in crisis?	4840.31	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, I think a lot of it has
happened.	4845.44	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, if we talk about the regionals
and why they're down today, I think it's	4847.96	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	because they've lost deposits.
And although maybe deposit flight slows	4851.41	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	down thanks to this program, a lot of
that money simply isn't going to go	4855.13	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	back.
So they know and they've damaged the.	4858.49	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Profitability, but I think, you know,
once you're down 70, 80 percent from	4862.71	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	where you were last Wednesday,
you know, a lot of that's happened.	4866.58	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But the question now is what are the
knock on effects?	4870.48	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	If we assume the sort of bullish
scenario, which is the regulators and	4873.06	5.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Fed are able to clean up this in the
short term, I think looking ahead, what	4878.16	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	we have is radically tighter lending
standards in venture capital and	4882.12	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	commercial real estate.
And so now I think you look out three,	4885.93	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	six, nine months and you say, you know,
who could potentially be damaged.	4889.05	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And again, you always look back to who
really took advantage of ultra low rates	4893.58	5.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and who really had a fantastic 18, 24
months between the end of Covid and the	4899.1	5.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	end of 2021.
You know, I mean, are concerns would be	4904.74	5.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	centered around private credit, private
equity, you know, if if as a secondary	4909.93	5.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	crisis down the road in the same way as
Bear Stearns led to Lehman, that's kind	4915.21	4.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of where we would be.
This speaks to the shadows at the	4919.74	2.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	moment.
We've heard from many other guests that	4922.14	1.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the shadow is out there now.
Is this huge?	4924.03	2.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Our Silicon Valley, John, you mentioned
this earlier, this just magnitude of	4926.58	4.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	money that flowed into these people.
Who do we blame for that?	4931.38	6.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	To use a sophisticated word, the
ginormous move of money that we see.	4937.61	4.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is it the Biden stimulus?
Yes.	4942.12	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And over trumped stimulus before that.
I mean, I think pretty much everything	4945.0	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that happened after May, 80 percent of
what happened after May 2020 was a	4948.21	4.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	mistake.
We had a real crisis and meet in May	4952.95	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	2020.
And thank God we stepped in and did	4956.67	1.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	something really radical.
And, you know, the second and third	4958.56	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	waves of people being indiscriminate was
a mistake.	4961.53	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Sending checks to everybody was a
mistake taking interest rates to where	4964.23	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	they were and then keeping them for that
long.	4967.95	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It was all a mistake.
And we talked about it in real time.	4970.05	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And unfortunately, vis vis now looks
like one of these classic moves from	4973.26	4.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	ultra easy monetary and fiscal policy
into into something much tighter.	4977.43	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I would say, you know, the Fed for
the time being isn't really what we	4982.2	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	should be focused on.
I don't really care if they go 25 or 50	4985.8	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	basis points or nothing on on Wednesday,
the market will cave in the short term.	4989.16	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What I'm concerned about is whether we
are entering a period of much, much,	4993.15	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	much tighter lending standards, because
that's what will affect the underlying	4997.05	4.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	economy.
If that happens, what gives you the	5001.64	1.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	impression that we will?
Well, you've taken out a bunch of the	5003.41	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	most aggressive lenders, the regional
banks, which survive.	5006.5	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, the lesson from this last week
is for shareholders and the bond holders	5010.07	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	lost everything.
Okay.	5013.34	1.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Depositors are okay.
But if you running a bank and you're	5014.72	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	looking at your own personal wealth and
your shareholders wealth and your	5017.42	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	bondholders are going to be screaming at
you, don't you dare turn me into Silicon	5020.39	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Valley.
You're going to have to run a much, much	5024.17	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	more conservative bank.
Plus, you've lost a ton of your deposits	5027.44	3.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and the deposits have flown into these
very large banks that aren't simply	5031.07	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	going to be as aggressive, you know, at
the margin.	5035.33	2.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So, you know, the advice I would give
people in this sort of business world is	5037.37	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I would be securing lines of credit from
high quality banks right now before you	5041.84	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	need them.
Because when you need them, they may not	5045.89	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	be available.
So you've got to make a market call with	5048.41	2.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that is your framework.
What is it?	5050.81	1.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You know, I think, well, we'll clean up
this mess and valley and then it will	5054.45	4.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	become apparent later this year that
we've got a real problem coming back.	5059.31	3.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's my guess.
And, you know, in the meantime, I think	5062.7	2.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	certain assets do okay.
I think this is a big win for precious	5064.74	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	metals again.
Do you think this is a win for big tech	5067.8	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that used to be interest rate sensitive?
No.	5071.07	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think the reason why the Nasdaq does
so well now as it doesn't have any banks	5074.19	3.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in it.
But NASDAQ 100 and everyone forgets that	5077.19	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	it did OK in 0 8 till Lehman because it
had no banks in it, no business missed	5079.71	3.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	it.
Look, this is helpful at the margins.	5083.68	1.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, interest rates don't go as high
as we thought.	5085.56	2.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It helps for NASDAQ, but there's nothing
really very positive here for technology	5087.96	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	earnings going forwards.
The big spenders of the banks, you said	5091.92	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	it's good for precious metals.
Yes.	5094.89	1.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Are you saying that we're going to face
higher inflation with financial?	5097.08	3.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There's an awful lot of money now which
has been forced to do something.	5101.28	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And when things calm down and people are
OK.	5105.27	1.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What could I be doing with that money?
You know, I don't think the dollar ends	5107.16	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	up you know, the dollar's recent
strength seems to have ended.	5111.45	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think crypto has a lot of like lot of
shadows, a lot of shadows, overt and	5115.74	5.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	gold kind of stands out.
Thomas Schroeder is coming up after you.	5121.11	3.42

Keefe, Bruyette Woods is the backbone of	5124.75	4.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	their business.
When they do lines of credit with larger	5129.01	3.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	banks, are they nothing more than a
proxy for J.P.	5132.99	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Morgan or Bank of America?
Are we deluding ourselves as a nation if	5136.26	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	they've got to get lines of credit from
large money center banks?	5140.61	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Look, I think it's a sucky situation.
This is this isn't where you want to be	5144.27	4.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	CFA, just the sub.
Exactly.	5148.65	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is not what you want to be.
This is the point we were trying to make	5153.19	3.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	18 months ago, which is as great as this
boom felt and as fantastic as everything	5156.63	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	was.
It doesn't lead to good outcomes.	5161.04	1.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Michael, you're just excellent.
This is really thoughtful stuff.	5163.26	2.64

Beijing's modest economic growth target	5224.37	4.05

Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm Lisa Mateo and this is Bloomberg.	5293.73	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, it almost feels like we're back
in 2007, 2008, when we have a major bank	5308.44	6.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	or even a substantial player, Silicon
Valley Bank should not have got to the	5314.98	5.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	point and regulators should not have
allowed it to get to the point where	5320.3	3.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	there is essentially a run on the bank
and the FDIC has to take over.	5323.41	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And, you know, California regulators are
shutting it down.	5326.89	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And this smells bad from New York City
this morning.	5329.8	3.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Good morning to you all.
Coming off the back of the worst week in	5334.63	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the equity market for the year.
So far, futures trying to bounce and not	5337.21	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	doing it very successfully.
Futures right now are down about a tenth	5340.57	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of one percent on a S&P 500 bond market.
Looks like they're short tenure yields	5343.78	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	lower on a tenure now by 19 basis
points.	5347.83	3.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Look at this move on a two year.
Let me get it to Europe, guys.	5350.89	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Your tier yield is down 46, almost 47
basis points lower to four point one,	5354.01	6.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	two percent.
And I'll keep going back to what I said	5360.64	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	repeatedly earlier this morning,
Wednesday, intraday 5.0, eight percent.	5363.43	5.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We have had almost a 100 basis point
move in just a couple of sessions and	5369.22	4.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	change.
I don't have a moving average study,	5374.17	1.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	John, on Credit Suisse.
But I'm gonna make clear in the last	5375.8	3.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	hour, it's been a series of lower highs
and lower lows on a moving average	5379.03	5.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	basis.
I'm eyeballing the Credit Suisse.	5384.1	1.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Trading in Swiss francs is at lows for
the day on a moving average basis, that	5386.13	3.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	20 percent.
Yeah, it's on when you see the curve	5390.14	1.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	ball stay open the way it is right now
as aggressively as it is right now.	5392.11	4.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That doesn't usually tell a nice bedtime
story to help us all sleep at night.	5397.07	4.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Somebody is on the backside of that
trade.	5401.6	1.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But I'd also take it in further, John,
from the conventional two years	5403.37	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	statistic to three months.
And we're now, as we were in 0 7, was	5406.43	5.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	studies of three month dynamics to two
months.	5411.49	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I don't pretend to be adult on that.
In the old days, it was labor.	5414.01	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I yes, IRA Jersey says there's some new
alphabet soup.	5417.43	2.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm not sure it is.
Lisa's diner.	5420.07	1.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Get any of the brand.
OK, I'm on the sofa.	5421.7	1.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Oh, yeah.
I look at the Oprah.	5423.7	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I know it so far.
You raise a good point, though, about a	5426.46	3.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	boss deep enough.
Her.	5429.46	0.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This question of are we looking at Fed
rate cuts in the face of something very	5430.59	4.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	dramatic in the next couple of years, 50
basis point move and point 0 8 percent	5435.25	6.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	on a two year, that is 100 basis points
lower.	5441.32	2.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right.
Just Wednesday from just Wednesday, some	5444.4	2.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	months to move.
It was Friday, early morning, Sunday as	5447.02	3.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	we worked through the week.
And I said get more showed.	5450.34	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	He has with KBW have been attached to
small banking and securities analysis of	5453.79	6.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	banking through my entire career.
Thomas showed as CEO of KBW, a Stifel	5460.48	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	company.
We're thrilled he could join us from	5464.82	2.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	California this morning.
Tom, I don't know where to begin with	5467.97	3.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	eight themes, but to cut to the chase,
you've lived this Joel Weber.	5471.25	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What should Jerome Powell do in the
coming hours and days?	5475.72	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think this is still a moment about
confidence.	5481.09	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's confidence for depositors to know
that the money in their bank is safe.	5484.81	4.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's also confidence among investors.
You've got an S&P 500 company whose	5489.97	6.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	stock just went to zero pretty quickly.
And so investors want to know that the	5496.27	6.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	confident want to have confidence in the
system as well.	5502.9	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And so we need orderliness.
And that's what I think is necessary at	5506.71	5.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the moment.
And	5511.87	1.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	you can see took action last night and
we're going to find out if it's a nice	5514.38	3.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	enough if more is needed.
I'm very simply here.	5518.38	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	My theme for the year, not seeing any of
this coming is the great zombie roller,	5522.13	4.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Keefe, Bruyette.
And Woods is expert at gauging the	5527.23	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	zombies out there among thousands of
banks.	5531.52	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	How troubled is our banking system?
How many zombies are out there for?	5535.18	4.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Two thousand twenty three.
Great zombie roll up.	5539.35	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I'll tell you that the bank that fell
last week, Silicon Valley on on all the	5543.46	5.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	measures was probably one of the biggest
risk takers in terms of interest rates	5548.74	6.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with their bond portfolio.
They were an outlier.	5555.07	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	My conversation with many bank CEOs is
that the deposit outflow contagion had	5559.36	7.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	not spread throughout the industry.
However, I know that concern was raising	5566.44	5.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and rising.
And you could see, I think if this	5572.17	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	continues, you could see it to start to
affect banks that very prudently manage	5574.72	5.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	themselves.
And that's what happens when consumer	5579.88	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	behavior or commercial behavior for
deposits changes quickly.	5583.06	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's why I think we need a government
support mechanism to make things	5586.9	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	orderly.
We've got some of that last night if	5591.34	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	it's not enough.
I think they've got to do they should do	5593.56	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	more.
But you know, what's really interesting,	5596.26	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Tom, is this is all about the unwinding
of Covid relief.	5599.68	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There are two things that happened that
dramatically impacted the banking	5603.76	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	industry.
One is we've had rate increases at the	5607.27	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	fastest pace of my career.
It's been fast and it's been significant	5611.53	4.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in terms of its measure.
Number two is that the system during	5616.19	4.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Covid was flooded, the banking system
with deposits.	5621.01	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There's a purposeful effort right now to
drain liquidity and drain those positive	5624.91	4.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	deposits.
It's happening at a pace that I don't	5629.95	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	think any management team in banking has
ever seen before.	5633.4	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So while that's happening, you have a
crisis of confidence which is	5637.06	4.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	compounding the issue.
And that's why I think we need this	5642.04	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	broader support.
If I were to show you the market, the	5645.34	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	metrics of a typical bank, they're
actually outstanding credit quality as	5648.31	4.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	it is of no concern at the moment.
You've got you've got companies that	5653.02	4.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	have stable capital, but they weren't
necessarily built to have this type of	5657.85	5.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	stress put on deposits overnight.
And that's why I think we need a calming	5663.01	4.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	influence barring some sort of further
intervention from the federal	5667.6	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	government.
Tom, what are you doing at KBW to	5671.74	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	attract deposits and to keep the ones
you have?	5674.47	2.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, my firm KBW were were securities
firm.	5678.43	3.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But I think that I think that
so we don't we don't attract deposits at	5682.66	5.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	KBW, so to speak.
But I think what I am talking to most	5688.39	4.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	banks in the industry, they have the
liquidity.	5693.16	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There are plenty of ability, but they
have lines and avenues that a bank can	5696.61	4.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	go down to augment their liquidity.
So my sense is that depositors demands	5701.56	6.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	will be met.
And I think other banks are.	5708.16	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Some banks are seeing tremendous inflows
from some of these other banks.	5711.97	5.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So so it's not equal everywhere in the
industry.	5717.31	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I think things are steady enough as
long as they don't get worse.	5722.38	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's my point.
What time do you expect smaller and	5726.04	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	regional banks to have to pay more to
attract just regular depositors who	5728.74	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	think, well, why shouldn't we just put
our bank at the big money centers that	5733.18	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	are too big to fail?
Well, yes, I think.	5737.23	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think that I think in the third
quarter of last year where the light	5741.49	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	switch went on, so to speak, in terms of
deposit competition, and that happened	5745.06	6.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	because of the speed at which FDIC
deposits have been shrinking because of	5751.12	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	monetary policy.
So.	5755.08	2.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So we saw that competition sort of green
light happen in the third quarter.	5757.31	4.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I think.
And it's not just a banking industry	5762.13	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	competing with itself.
It's market rates.	5764.92	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Treasuries were offering a compelling
alternative to deposits.	5768.04	5.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So so that competition was building and
that's how how funds have been draining	5773.53	5.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	out of the systems.
I tell though, I've gotta run.	5778.9	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I've just got a headline I need to get
to.	5782.47	1.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Thanks for being with us this morning,
Tommy Shank of KBW.	5784.0	2.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Time for the president is going to speak
on a banking system, 9:00 a.m.	5787.73	3.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Eastern Time.
So 9:00 a.m.	5791.56	1.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Eastern time.
So about an hour of five minutes from	5793.42	2.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	now is on the schedule.
Their system move.	5796.09	2.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We need to talk about the two year
weighed down by 45 basis points, 413 had	5799.03	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	a break a 10 just moments ago.
I put this out on Twitter for you.	5803.35	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	If you want to see the chart time I set,
the Fed decides when it's time to hike	5806.65	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the market usually decides when that
down in the market is screaming, your	5810.19	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	town is there.
And the ten year yield, as we just	5813.64	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	showed, is done on radio.
These are extraordinary charts.	5816.88	2.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's all you need to
know.	5819.4	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I don't know if you have ready yet,
guys.	5821.74	1.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The Bloomberg Financial Conditions
Index, you can take about 20 or 50 days.	5823.31	4.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And the answers, John, I've never seen
this.	5828.25	2.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's a compendium of eleven ratios and
Jihye Lee.	5830.5	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We were slightly restrictive.
We were accommodative in the plunge to a	5833.74	5.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	new tightness, to a new restriction in
the system.	5838.99	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I would editorialize.
We've never seen it before.	5842.29	2.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There are two ways of looking at this.
One is, yes, the market is right that	5845.17	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	down.
The second is this the moves announced	5848.89	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	yesterday allow the Fed reserve to keep
on going and to focus on inflation	5852.1	5.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	because they know they've got the tools
to deal with a failed institution.	5857.29	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's going to be the other way of
looking at this.	5860.32	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Now, I'm not going to offer my view on
the situation.	5862.3	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Tell me.
I'm just establishing the two ways	5864.37	1.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	through which people will observe the
current situation.	5866.5	2.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	One is that the Federal Reserve is done.
That's captured by this market right	5869.14	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	now.
The other is what was announced	5872.38	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	yesterday gives them the tools to carry
on high CAC.	5874.45	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, then trauma.
With the president speaking, it also	5877.78	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	does come down to what to do, the
economy.	5880.27	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, suddenly the Atlanta GDP.
Now statistic perhaps needs adjustment.	5882.46	5.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The president of the United States
addressed the nation, had Wall Street 2	5887.89	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in about an hour from now.	5891.91	0.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Clearly, the banking system is telling
us that there's some kind of issue here,	5900.06	5.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and I would say, Lisa, that money has
been shut down.	5905.87	3.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The banking system for the first time
really is dealing with negative deposit	5910.08	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	growth.
Totally.	5913.35	0.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We don't see this as a systemic crisis.
Nothing compared to 0 8 0 9 or 1990.	5914.66	4.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I cannot believe that what's happening
in the banking sector will not see if	5919.74	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Fed falls in this market.
This is almost like the opposite of the	5923.04	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	global financial crisis.
And now the fears are way out there.	5927.69	2.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	When the banks are more resilient than
they've been in a generation.	5930.63	2.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom
Keene, Jonathan Ferro and Lisa	5933.53	4.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Abramowicz.
Good morning, everyone.	5938.25	2.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Jonathan Ferro Lisa Abramowicz Tom Keene
on radio and television are Crisis	5941.72	3.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Nation around the world this morning
there is financial crisis.	5945.56	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The president of the United States will
speak in the 9:00 hour.	5952.58	1.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	John, what are we going to hear from
President Bush?	5954.77	1.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, let's start with the politics.
First time, I think this administration	5956.28	2.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	is probably very nervous about this
being characterized as a bailout that	5958.81	4.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	politically won't play well.
So they're going to go through things	5963.23	1.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	piece by piece and really points out
that in the European phrasing of this	5965.09	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	time, we call this a bail in equities
and debt shareholders.	5968.93	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They don't get anything.
They get bailed into the whole process.	5972.74	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	No bailout for them.
But ultimately, there is a lifeline here	5975.29	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	for Wall Street banks.
And that lifeline has been provided,	5978.5	2.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	T.K., from the Federal Reserve.
With that new lending facility, allowing	5981.17	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	them to place securities that are
deeply, deeply underwater.	5985.25	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right.
Right.	5988.06	0.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Post that collateral at par at the
Federal Reserve.	5988.89	3.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that's a big development yesterday.
And then news moving as John, I don't	5992.12	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	think you saw this as you worked on that
question here.	5995.54	1.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Red and green on the screen, markets
quite volatile.	5997.2	2.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We've told you about the bond market.
Moments ago, the rework here of the	5999.59	5.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Silicon Valley Bank.
The gentleman from the Fannie Mae coming	6005.32	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in to begin to run that shop here, all
moving in real time before the	6007.78	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	president.
And John, to me, what this shows is the	6012.13	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	immediate urgency to figure out where
the haircut is going to be on troubled	6015.25	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	banks, troubled bonds.
And let's work this out now.	6019.63	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	In the meantime, this market is
screaming.	6023.51	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	D.J., you've done yet done a screaming
that this morning.	6025.52	4.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I have no idea if that's going to be
ultimately where we end up at the next	6030.1	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	meeting of the Federal Reserve or later
this year.	6033.46	1.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But to see the two year down another 41
basis points, pricing out rate hikes in	6035.74	5.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the back end of the year, pricing gain,
more rate cuts, Tom.	6040.84	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's the argument right now.
And if you just tuning again, this two	6043.35	2.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	very clear camps.
One is the market is right.	6045.46	1.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That done to what was announced
yesterday will allow this Fed reserve to	6046.93	4.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	say, look, we've got the tools to deal
with failed banks and we can carry on	6051.91	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	focusing on inflation.
Now, what would be helpful if some Fed	6054.97	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	speak for once?
Unfortunately, you're not going to get	6057.7	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to the quiet period for the Federal
Reserve.	6059.68	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Key headline I mentioned an hour ago.
Did they see this coming?	6061.84	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	To be honest, no.
Brent crude, the global oil price, Lisa,	6064.81	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	under 80 dollars a barrel is no doubt
10000.	6068.51	2.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But it signals a linkage here of all
we're talking about into the global GDP.	6071.37	5.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	An American GDP call to put these two
things together, the idea of fewer rate	6078.4	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	hikes or even no more rate hikes.
And actually, the Fed cutting rates is	6082.57	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	viewed as a negative because it comes on
the heels of potential true distress.	6086.2	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I think that one of the key
questions is how much do lending	6090.25	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	standards to Michael Barr point, how
much to lenders lending standards	6093.73	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	tighten really meaningfully over the
next couple of months in a way that	6096.22	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	hadn't, well, dissipated?
That really accelerates some of the	6100.1	4.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	disinflationary process without the Fed
having to raise rates further.	6104.44	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And if it does it, what does that mean
in terms of the dual mandate for a	6106.71	5.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Federal Reserve that's looking at
inflation, that's running at the hardest	6111.91	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	pace, still going back 40 years?
John, what would Powell say?	6114.01	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The president speaks at 9:00.
Secretary Treasury comes out at 12,	6119.26	2.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	maybe 3:00 p.m.
ish.	6121.54	1.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The chairman comes out and he has to
make, you know, comments from a written	6123.19	5.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	statement and he says them into a super
restrictive America.	6128.23	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's where we've turned since Friday.
I don't know what to say, but I know my	6131.9	3.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	question would be, is policy now in
conflict for the Federal Reserve?	6135.55	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Do you have to deal with financial
stability, risk and elevated inflation	6138.52	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	simultaneously at the same time?
How difficult is that?	6142.96	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Do you have the tools to deal with one
at the same time?	6145.06	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You have the tools to deal with the
other.	6147.39	1.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right now, the governor of the bank,
having had some experience of this back	6148.75	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in September, he took situation this.
I get all that.	6153.04	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But they really wanted to communicate
that we have the tools to deal with one	6156.18	3.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and the tools to deal with another.
I think Lisa's right just to lean on	6159.38	3.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	what we heard in the last hour from
Michael Hsiao.	6162.88	1.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Michael talked about lending standards
are going to tighten up in the United	6165.45	3.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	States of America.
Banks are going to have to be more	6168.52	2.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	conservative.
Why?	6170.65	0.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Because CEOs, shareholders, debt holders
got wiped in those bank failures.	6172.57	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Yes, depositors are made whole.
We understand that based on the	6176.08	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	developments of yesterday time.
But if you're running one of these	6178.96	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	banks, all of a sudden, you've got to
run your institution maybe a little bit	6181.33	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	more tightly than you were previously.
You have three breaking headlines here.	6184.87	2.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Let's get out front of the next headline
here.	6188.74	0.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Moments ago, Lisa Lower Lowe's Credit
Suisse breaks down not quite to lows for	6189.89	6.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the day, not quite to record lows, but
the stock acting Eric Balchunas.	6196.63	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We haven't necessarily seen the end, at
least the pricing not only of Credit	6200.75	3.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Suisse but other banks.
Which raises a question, why not?	6204.64	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	If this is really just a crisis of
confidence, why was the move by by U.S.	6207.12	5.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	authorities over the weekend not enough
to stave off some of the concern about	6213.07	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	perhaps more bank runs or perhaps
greater weakness in some of the weaker	6215.29	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	failed institutions?
Let's get to it right now.	6219.31	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	John, do we need to do any data?
Is there any data there, Scott Thompson,	6221.83	3.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	on us, whether it would be here all day?
Because I'd carry on, carry on.	6224.83	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Speak.
No one wants that broader.	6227.59	2.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Just so e-mail me.
No.	6230.18	1.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Tell John not to do a dirty jokes about
her a job or joins us right now on this	6231.73	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	historic day.
Was society in general, Sabrina?	6236.08	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I want to speak, I think, towards what
the president will comment on here.	6239.48	3.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What can we glean from the fixed income
markets that can help politicians gauge	6243.69	6.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the moment?
What should they be watching in fixed	6250.65	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	income?
Well, we're not watching anything	6254.04	4.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	specifically in the fixed income market
per say, but what I think we should be	6258.6	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	encouraged by is the fact that financial
planning conditions are still relatively	6262.92	4.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	easy.
You're not seeing a meltdown in the in	6267.66	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the equity market.
You're not really seeing broader risks	6271.41	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of contagion in all markets.
This seems to be very localized, if you	6273.79	6.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	will, in the bond market.
You're seeing a pretty dramatic decline	6280.26	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in yields as the market starts to price
out rate hikes for this year.	6284.67	4.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So for the most part, at least thus far,
it seems to be localized to the price	6290.17	5.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	action, I should say, in the bond
market.	6295.83	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And we're not really seeing a big risk
of a contagion to thanks a batch of one.	6297.85	4.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You called for lower yields.
Could get in the Van OMXS way this	6302.17	3.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	morning.
We'll come back on that call in just a	6306.0	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	moment.
The second thing, there's two clear	6308.31	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	camps emerging.
We've been discussing them in the last	6310.38	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	hour or so.
One is that the market is right.	6312.93	1.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This Fed reserve is done.
The second camp is ultimately the Fed	6314.45	3.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	has shown it has the tools to deal with
deal with failed banks and can focus on	6317.73	5.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	tactic inflation.
Which can you in?	6323.1	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's gonna have to be the latter, I
think it's very soon to make a call on	6326.73	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Fed being done like you guys have
been discussing over the last couple of	6330.78	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	minutes.
You look at inflation that's running	6334.47	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	very hot.
You have a very strong labor market.	6337.44	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And most importantly, financial
conditions are easy.	6340.95	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The financial stability risks seem to be
somewhat ring fenced and isolated with a	6344.88	6.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	couple of banks.
The question really becomes one of does	6351.66	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the Fed have all the tools it needs to
be able to contain this problem?	6355.17	5.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And again, you know, you guys do a good
job of outlining what happened in the	6360.6	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	UK.
I think the parallels there are very	6364.56	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	precious for this particular moment
where the Fed can kind of threaten	6367.5	3.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	either on two separate issues and
continue to raise rates.	6370.5	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You know, in
the March meeting and even beyond, if we	6375.03	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	can't kind of deal with the problem at
hand to butter.	6379.38	3.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I wouldn't just talk about the mechanics
of the bond market at a time when you're	6382.91	2.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	seeing a 50 basis point move, the two
year at a time and so many people had	6385.8	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	parked their cash in this debt.
How much is this kind of creating	6389.73	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	fragilities in and of itself that there
is such incredible volatility in the	6393.75	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	benchmark basic instruments that people
use as tools of safety?	6397.29	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So if it is a tool of safety, you want
to be long the bond and you've been kind	6403.5	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of talking about that pretty much since
the beginning of the year.	6407.1	3.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Even when you started to rise is that
this is typically the sort of price	6410.94	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	action you tend to see in the bond
market towards the end of the cycle	6414.9	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	where the market gets a little bit
skittish on the potential turn in	6418.8	4.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	policy.
So especially given the fact that yields	6423.75	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	have risen so dramatically, our view has
consistently been that the risk of	6426.99	4.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	yields are asymmetrically skewed towards
the downside.	6431.82	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that's exactly what you're seeing in
the price action.	6434.91	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Yes, the moves look very dramatic, and
that's because the absolute level of the	6438.54	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	two year was at 5 5 above 5 percent just
a week ago.	6442.05	4.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So a lot of that repricing is going to
happen in the very front end.	6446.91	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So that doesn't surprise me at all.
But what what we have to see going	6450.99	5.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	forward is not really read too much into
the price action here.	6456.33	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This could be partly driven by position
on given the fact that the market was	6459.99	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	extraordinarily short heading into the
into the March FOMC meeting.	6464.4	4.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But I think cooler heads will prevail
when we have more information on how	6469.44	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this rout is going to play out.
Broadly speaking, how are you going to	6473.01	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	play this about how you're going to lean
into the long end?	6475.86	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Are you going to basically cash in on
some of the short positions you've had,	6478.32	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the short, short end of the curve?
We really didn't have any any shot.	6481.77	6.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think we have been leaning long in
bonds for a good portion of this year,	6488.23	4.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	given the fact that, you know, it's
really hard to call the pivot on policy.	6493.64	4.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So it's kind of, you know, especially
given the fact that you get such good	6499.47	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	returns and bonds.
Our bias was always perhaps played from	6503.37	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	from the long and because, yes, we might
lose the last 25 basis points of rate	6507.12	4.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	hikes or not be able to know where the
trauma fed funds rate is.	6511.95	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But broadly speaking, the market's going
to look towards a trajectory of lower	6515.13	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	yields over the next year or two.
So in that sort of context, I think that	6519.45	4.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	long play made sense.
That said, with me moved quite	6524.34	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	significantly lower here.
So I think it will probably take a	6527.61	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	pause, look at how things evolve.
I wouldn't be surprised if we see	6530.46	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	another leg higher in yields if we start
to pricing more hikes as as the time	6533.94	6.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	progresses, given the fact that we're
not anywhere near achieving the goal on	6540.69	4.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	inflation.
Zapatera your banker was looking pretty	6545.67	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	good this monarch and over the last
couple of days, that's for sure.	6547.62	2.28

Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Thank you.
Tracy Alloway.	6552.19	1.28

And on Twitter just moments ago she said	6553.47	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	there and I'm looking forward to the
outlets podcast around the story with	6556.43	3.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Joe Weisenthal.
I'm sure there are a few out over the	6560.04	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	next couple of weeks on a bank with
subpar risk management and flaky	6562.14	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	depositors just change the US financial
system forever.	6566.64	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Tom There's many dimensions that a
story, but that take is an important	6569.58	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	one.
It's an important one because Tracy has	6574.05	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	legitimate San Francisco cred in her
travels.	6577.15	3.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	She spent a lot of time out there.
So if I see Flake, you sound like an	6580.8	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	idiot.
She says Flake is valid when I quote.	6584.97	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is that okay?
No, no, I'm saying it's slightly works.	6588.0	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Tracy is hard wired that John Credit

new lows.	6595.56	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You begin to wonder, are one hand or in
Swiss francs and Credit Suisse were not	6598.89	4.07

Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	week for the first time since he
launched the invasion of Ukraine.	6629.96	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The March 16th gathering with the top
members of the Russian Union of	6632.69	4.59

Chinese leader Xi Jinping plans to speak	6649.22	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with Ukrainian President Vladimir ISE
Lenski for the first time since the	6652.43	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	start of the Ukraine war.
Bloomberg has learned the visit will	6655.67	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	likely come after he meets with Russian
President Vladimir Putin as soon as next	6658.94	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	week.
Xi Jinping has started an unprecedented	6662.72	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	third term as China's president, with
fresh vows to ensure stability and	6666.17	4.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	strengthen party leadership.
In his speech closing out the annual	6670.4	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	National People's Congress, he vowed to
oppose foreign interference in Taiwan, a	6673.85	6.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	veiled reference to increasing American
support for the government in Taipei.	6680.48	2.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	U.S.
authorities took extraordinary measures	6684.47	1.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to shore up confidence in the financial
system after the collapse of Silicon	6686.06	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Valley Bank, introducing a new backstop
for banks that Federal Reserve officials	6690.17	7.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	say is big enough to protect the entire
nation's deposits.	6697.31	0.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The Treasury Department, Federal Reserve
and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.	6698.9	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	followed a frantic weekend.
That's all the surprise closure of New	6702.74	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	York's signature bank, along with
mounting concerns about spillover	6706.01	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	effects to other regional lenders and
the wider economy.	6710.27	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Global news power by more than twenty
seven hundred journalists and analysts	6713.75	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in over 120 countries.
I'm Lisa Mateo and this is Bloomberg.	6717.54	5.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	He said banks are now ready to banks are
in a very different place than the	6741.8	5.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	regional community banks.
I think the market will continue to suss	6747.48	3.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that out.
But, you know, you go back to it was an	6751.19	5.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	outlier in almost every metric that
monkey will CAC.	6756.23	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So to me, it's far from systemic.
I think this is just a snap reaction	6760.25	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	more than anything else.
Rick Peters of PJM there.	6764.77	2.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, for the regulator, it was
systemic.	6767.42	1.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They use any systemic exception and came
out and said, we're going to make our	6769.64	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	depositors whole.
So that tells you a lot about how they	6772.91	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	fit the situation from New York City
this morning.	6774.86	2.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Good morning.
A lot of you have written and thank you	6778.1	1.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	for that, including Bill Lee of the
Milken Institute.	6780.08	1.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	He said this.
He said Regulatory support from the	6781.92	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	FDIC, the Federal Reserve, are the
appropriate ways to deal with bank	6784.85	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	exacts risk management.
Fabius and liquidity shortfalls.	6788.6	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Monetary objectives.
Bell says, should not be compromised	6791.65	3.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with non systemic bank failures.
We keep using this phrase, not systemic.	6795.49	5.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, the way they treated it yesterday
at least said it was a fear that it	6801.11	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	might be.
Well, there was a fear that it might be.	6805.04	1.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And they took actions.
And you're still seeing the fallout and	6806.98	2.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	shares.
Which raises a question of a it.	6809.36	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Was it systemic?
B, was it enough?	6812.45	2.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And see, what does this mean longer
term, especially at a time to Belize	6816.95	1.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	point where you do still have an
inflation problem and you still have to	6818.27	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	have a policy to combat that.
I would go obi ISE.	6822.26	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They're going to become overcome by
events.	6824.51	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that's where the markets open now
and it's of good value.	6826.31	2.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I've got Brent crude going down to new
lows.	6828.47	1.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Seventy eight dollars, 85 cents.
And Global Oil, John, 72, 77 and West	6831.83	5.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Texas Intermediate.
We begin to think about a 60 handle	6837.53	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	there.
We can go on and on, but the markets are	6839.91	4.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	reacting and that changes the political
dialogue that Bill Lee knows in a major	6844.04	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	way.
Lisa mentioned some of those single	6847.79	1.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	names.
First Republic pick one stance, 64	6849.35	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	percent in the premarket.
Go to Europe, to Switzerland, pick	6851.78	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	another.
The beleaguered Credit Suisse is down by	6855.14	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	almost 13 percent to 17 and just about
holding on to it to handle.	6857.66	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I got to the bond market to take a
hair this morning for the front end of	6862.31	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the curve content.
My ISE office was down more than 40	6865.19	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	basis points on a two year this mark at
the moment.	6869.0	1.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	No, not my view.
Just this mark at the moment is	6870.5	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	screaming to the Fed.
We think you.	6873.71	0.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Mark Gurman idea, Bob, that the oil just
breaks through to a new low.	6874.84	3.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	To me, John, I agree.
The two year yield breaking down below	6878.21	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	point 5 0 would be a new retest.
Dani Burger.	6881.42	2.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This just coming out from Andrew Holland
horse to bell this point.	6883.91	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	He thinks that markets are once again
underpricing how high fed policy rates	6888.08	2.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	will need to rise and how long they will
stay there and still reaffirms the	6890.72	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	potential for a five and a half to 575
percent terminal Fed funds rate at a	6894.26	4.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	time when right now the market has it
priced at about a percentage point below	6899.0	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that.
George Bush the younger 15 years ago, a	6901.58	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	September evening.
Over the past few weeks, many Americans	6906.02	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	have felt anxiety about their finances
and their future.	6909.77	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I understand their worry and their
frustration, perhaps copy for the	6914.48	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	president of United States here in 45 or
so minutes.	6918.38	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Joining us are Bloomberg financial
crisis correspondent in Washington,	6922.1	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Annmarie Horden Emory.
Just simply.	6925.53	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You've been listening, reporting on
this, listening to White House people.	6929.27	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What is the Zeit Geist at the White
House?	6933.44	1.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is the president will speak to the
nation?	6937.46	0.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, I think it's a massive lack of
sleep at the White House this weekend,	6938.8	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	these individuals across the White
House, the Treasury, FDIC, have been	6941.86	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	working over the weekend to put this
plan in place.	6945.52	2.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And the president is going to speak at
9:00 a.m., something, you know, we	6948.19	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	weren't really expecting over the
weekend.	6951.85	1.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But then after last night's news,
they've come out and said he's actually	6953.29	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	going to address the American people.
I think Jonathan Maker made a really	6957.34	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	good point earlier, which is that this
administration wants to make sure to	6961.21	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	everyday Americans that this was not a
bail out.	6964.81	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	These depositors that even if you are
below the threshold, these depositors	6968.5	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	all being insured.
That statement said all money would be	6972.97	3.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	returned and you have access to it
today.	6976.21	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They want to make sure they know that is
not taxpayer dollars.	6978.88	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's going to be one thing.
I think the president will want to	6982.51	2.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	emphasize and I also want to talk about
the fact that they had to move promptly,	6984.61	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	because I guess that means they who are
concerned of potential risks further in	6987.97	5.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and the financial market and they want
to protect everyday consumers.	6993.34	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The other thing is you can expect the
president said in his statement, I'm	6997.66	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	firmly committed to holding those
responsible for this mess fully	7000.78	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	accountable and to continuing our
efforts to strengthen oversight and	7004.17	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	regulation of larger banks who are not
in this position again.	7007.53	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That opens up a field of what Congress
could potentially do following this	7011.1	4.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	chaos.
So this goes back to 2018.	7015.87	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The Trump administration, the
Republicans.	7018.78	2.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There was a bill to unwind some of the
regulation around smaller lenders,	7021.21	4.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	smaller banks, regionals.
I might say I believe there were 17	7025.26	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Democrats that voted alongside
Republicans on that bill.	7028.23	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Are we saying that they're going to push
to unwind much of that in the coming	7031.47	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	months?
Well, there was 17 Democrats that voted	7035.22	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	alongside Republicans for that bill.
Jonathan, you are correct.	7039.42	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You have to look at some of who some of
these individual individuals were.	7042.84	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They weren't states that Trump won.
So politically, this is something that	7045.96	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	they wanted to lean into because a lot
of them were up for re-election.	7049.17	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And then there was just a handful as
well.	7052.62	1.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There's a lot of bank lobbyists out in
full force during this time trying to	7054.51	4.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	get them to unwind some of this.
Many of them, like the one of the Dakota	7059.46	4.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	senators, Heidi Heitkamp, had come out
and said they don't understand the rural	7064.27	4.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	regional issues we are facing.
So the issue now is will those	7069.12	4.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Democrats, some that are still senators
today that voted for this, like Senator	7073.95	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Warner of Virginia, Senator Coons of
Delaware, would they be on board of	7078.87	5.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	rolling back that deregulation?
We rarely heard from Senator Elizabeth	7084.12	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Warren.
We've already heard from Senator Bernie	7087.48	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Sanders.
They are saying that 2018 law needs to	7089.85	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	be deregulated.
But for Trump, he said this was a	7093.3	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	bipartisan issue because 17 those
Democrats signed up for it.	7095.91	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What's going to be the consequence for
some of the management teams of banks	7099.21	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that do have to tap into the resources
that do struggle with some of the	7102.81	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	potential mark to mark losses on
portfolios that they did have control	7106.89	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	over?
I think what you're going to see in	7110.16	3.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	terms of consequences in Washington is
that there will be hearings in Congress.	7113.89	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, that is almost without a doubt
there will be hearings for certainly for	7117.55	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	SBB, certainly for Signature Bank.
You could expect Congress to call these	7121.87	5.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	individuals are the C suite of these
companies before the hell and testify on	7127.48	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	what went wrong and tried to draft how
they can avoid this in the future and	7131.98	5.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	just push it forward.
They are putting in David Westin is	7137.6	2.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	going to stand aside, is going to focus
on Wall Street week through the rest of	7139.93	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this year.
I'm looking forward to his conference.	7142.99	1.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You're going to step in, which I Matthew
to balance of power.	7144.61	2.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I understand the time if that's going to
move.	7147.16	1.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So it's going to be at 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time a little bit later this	7148.45	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	afternoon.
AMH first show today.	7151.51	1.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What a way to kick it up.
I mean, it's a slow basically we can use	7153.58	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and it's almost like an MH engineer
there.	7155.9	1.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What are you focused on a little bit
later?	7158.02	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think today we have to focus on the
conversation we just had right now.	7159.98	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What is not the response from Washington
following this collapse of SBB, this	7164.45	7.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	swift and prompt decision from Treasury,
the White House and the FDIC?	7171.64	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And what comes now and how do we prevent
this in the future?	7175.35	2.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Because the kick off show your effort,
Chairman Paul.	7178.46	3.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, I think that would be a good
solution.	7181.52	2.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I made I made a few requests.
Empower the treasury secretary.	7184.36	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Seriously, do we hear from Yellen and
Paul today?	7188.31	2.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Anne-Marie?
What we're first going to hear from the	7190.61	3.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	president and I think here he'll
probably leave it there, maybe send out	7194.53	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	some deputies.
When we heard from Secretary Yellen over	7197.5	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the weekend, Shery Ahn on Face the
Nation.	7200.26	1.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I doubt we are going to hear from Chair
Powell.	7201.66	2.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Remember, he just had two hearings last
week, another kind of awkward moment.	7205.06	3.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Remember all those Republicans were
telling him, warning him to ease up on	7208.93	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the capital requirements for banks.
Just last week, Kevin Cirilli read at	7213.1	5.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the hearings again this week just how
different might be, just they'd be so	7218.2	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	different.
My recollection of a long ago and far	7221.89	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	away, it seems like it was yesterday is
it was the same ogling as there were.	7225.28	4.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You looked at some authority and what
they said three days before was	7230.26	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	embarrassing.
Just changes.	7233.02	1.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm really looking forward to the show a
little bit later, which I'm Matthew, 5	7234.72	3.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	p.m.
Eastern Time.	7238.0	0.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's balance of power on TV and radio.
In the next hour on Bloomberg TV, a	7238.51	5.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	massive lineup, loads of people offering
their views on the situation.	7243.97	3.13
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Peter Schiff Academy, Michael Concept,
plus Richard Bernstein advisers.	7247.16	3.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Amy Silverman of RTS.
Ken Lee on a CFR.	7250.75	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I believe June and Emmanuel's going to
pop on the phone as well from Evercore	7254.05	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to give his view on a situation, some
with this market making a big move in	7257.65	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	bonds, making a huge mistake about
Julian Emmanuel.	7260.59	2.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that's something we have not talked
about this crisis.	7263.02	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	If we get the Evercore ISI view on
disinflation, forget about the crisis.	7266.74	4.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But if we get a disinflation vector that
begins to move towards 5 ish for 3 ish,	7272.65	5.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	how does that change everything we've
talked about this morning?	7278.67	2.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We've barely discussed the data this
morning.	7281.74	1.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's not just CPI tomorrow, it's retail
sales on Wednesday.	7283.8	3.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Last week, I think it started the way we
had all these conversations about 50.	7287.75	3.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And then Chairman Powell basically
talked about increasing the pace may be	7291.25	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	open the door to where we sat here.
I said it repeatedly.	7295.27	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Every conversation we have is at the
mercy of Fridays.	7298.6	1.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Data on Tuesdays dates are in general
was not relevant at all.	7300.12	4.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We don't care.
It's so much more than that, Lisa.	7304.39	2.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, the long and variable lags is
suddenly becoming relevant again.	7306.58	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Are we there in terms of the long and
variable lags?	7309.76	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that seems to be the implication in
market.	7313.75	0.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Mike Wolfson of Morgan Stanley says
those longer favor lags have arrived.	7314.68	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They're here right now.
35 year chart almost back to Volcker.	7318.39	3.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The large slope of Fed action is
unprecedented.	7322.01	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	How quickly the equity futures negative
four tenths of one percent from New York	7325.07	5.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	City.
This is Bloomberg Surveillance.	7330.13	1.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We welcome all of you on radio and
television to an American crisis.	7345.74	4.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The president will address the nation at
9:00 hour.	7351.29	1.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Help me out here if you can.
Amy, we're talking 9 0 0 9 1 5.	7353.9	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Do we know when the president will talk?
Right behind in the 9:00 o'clock hour as	7358.01	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	he is wont to do.
And maybe we'll hear from Secretary	7361.85	2.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Yellen as well.
Right now we're going to hear on the	7364.37	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	difference between now and the chaos of
yesterday, which is the markets are	7367.7	3.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	open.
So Lisa Abramowicz and I are going to	7370.73	2.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	address that.
I'm going to see a little bit of red in	7373.01	1.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the tape.
There's a new lack of a bit in the tape.	7374.79	3.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And Lisa, you've noticed the two year
yield is out to a shocking level.	7378.05	5.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, we've been talking about this all
morning and the movie just simply has	7383.78	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	accelerated.
Do we get a sub 4 percent to year yield	7387.11	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	today?
Right now, we're looking at four point 0	7390.44	1.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	5 percent on that two year yield exist.
The move has been dramatic when you take	7392.2	7.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	a look at Fed funds expectations.
Now we are pricing in a peak Fed funds	7399.26	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	rate of four point seven percent, which
then gets cut and we're pricing in about	7401.87	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	50 basis points of rate cuts.
Tom, by the end of the year, is the	7406.49	4.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	inflationary picture disinflationary
enough to justify a view in markets as	7411.14	5.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	seems to discount any potential for the
Fed to move?	7416.15	1.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I would suggest if your stock movers of
the last hour, the idea of following	7417.71	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	FTSE First Republic Bank of California
seems to be the single American stock to	7421.85	7.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	follow this morning.
Yeah, and there are a number of others	7429.05	3.0
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	as well as people try to parse out which
are the most vulnerable.	7432.05	1.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Even though we had a response that
supposedly backstops depositors above	7434.75	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	250000 dollars, what you needed on
technology is people get chosen.	7438.68	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	There was a woman out of Minnesota who
was exceptionally astute in operational	7443.57	5.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	research at Stanford, and she was
annoyed that I remember the day as clear	7448.82	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	as I can.
Marissa, who was annoyed as the leader	7452.87	4.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of Yahoo!
Many would say she at least stabilize a	7456.95	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	company and moved it along and its
eventual pain.	7459.68	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The gentleman that found her was Michael
J.	7462.5	2.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Wolf is co-founder and CEO of Activate
is a unique voice for technology in this	7465.65	6.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	country.
His work with MTV.	7471.77	1.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But far more with consulting with
McKinsey.	7473.81	2.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And he is a voice that when he gets when
it's a lot, it's Michael Wolff on line	7475.82	5.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to answer of the phone.
What did you do this weekend?	7481.06	3.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Were you glued to the phone this
weekend?	7484.13	1.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, it was a dark weekend for startups
and for venture capital firms and either	7485.87	6.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	on Twitter, either on message boards and
really blowing up my techs over the	7492.62	5.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	weekend because where people were
afraid, startups, investors were	7497.9	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	concerned that they wouldn't make
payroll this coming week and they were	7502.01	4.65
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	concerned that come Monday, they'd have
to start letting people go.	7506.66	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I want you to address the behavioral
construct that was beautifully described	7508.88	5.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	by The Wall Street Journal anecdote
after anecdote.	7514.19	1.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I'm not going to mince words.
Michael, it was fancy tech guys with	7516.04	5.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	fancy educations and fancy golf streams
from Big Sky in Montana flying back	7521.18	4.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	quickly to northern California to
salvage the mess.	7525.7	3.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That is the image that America has of
your world.	7529.72	4.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is it accurate?
Well, what's ironic is that in a lot of	7533.96	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	ways, the venture capitalists started
that.	7537.11	1.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And so it's the immediacy of social
media.	7541.55	0.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So starting on Wednesday, they already
started advising their startups to take	7543.44	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	money out.
And by Thursday, you know, over 40	7547.25	2.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	billion dollars had already left Silicon
Valley Bank.	7550.22	2.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right.
And so in a lot of ways, this was	7553.17	1.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	self-imposed.
And what's what's different about this	7555.02	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	versus 2008 was you had at that time you
had Twitter that had 200000 daily users	7557.96	6.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	today.
All of that communication is happening	7564.2	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	through social media.
And so it's not surprising you had a run	7567.53	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	on the bank.
What was so important in quality threads	7571.07	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this week and people that weren't
hysterical was Brad Setser wonderful at	7574.19	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Harvard and Oxford.
And at the end of his thread, Lisa, he	7578.36	5.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	was scathing about the lack of humility
among tech types.	7584.12	1.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Joel Weber Gary Gensler came out with a
statement from the S.E.C.	7585.17	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that they are investigating and bring
enforcement actions if we find	7589.02	5.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	violations of the federal securities
laws.	7594.71	0.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This raises questions of what potential
conflicts some of these individuals had.	7595.1	4.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Was that one of the discussions that
people were having over the weekend?	7601.64	1.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The main thing was this concern about
what this meant for startups themselves	7602.8	5.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and this concern overall for people
outside the technology business about	7608.61	4.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	what would this do to the innovation
that's been taking place.	7612.82	3.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, these were not big companies
worth companies, thousands of small	7616.34	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	companies who've.
Yes, taken in venture capital money.	7620.72	2.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But but there's concern that this would
shut down innovation, that V C's would	7623.83	6.16
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	not be able to finance companies come
this week or these coming months.	7629.99	2.07
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Michael Barr was on earlier and he was
saying that regardless of what happens	7632.75	3.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	and what the Fed is trying to do in the
Treasury Department to offset some of	7636.08	5.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the concerns about a failure to be able
to withdraw, it just posits that lending	7641.09	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	conditions would tighten materia.
And that some of these smaller companies	7644.81	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	would face much higher standards to
borrow at much higher rates.	7647.72	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Is that in the conversations that you're
having with many startups?	7651.59	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Absolutely.
I think they're worried about what	7654.5	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	happens.
Even though the Fed is going to backstop	7657.2	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the bank in there and their funds are
going to be available, I think their	7660.41	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	concern is will this have a chilling
effect on venture capital funding?	7663.68	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And will this have a chilling effect on
the places where they can borrow money?	7668.15	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And in a lot of cases, though, they're
there are many of them are expecting to	7671.72	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	keep their money at Silicon Valley Bank
over the weekend.	7675.77	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	A group of venture capitalists, Kleiner
Perkins and others in general Catalyst,	7679.04	5.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	they put out a statement that said no
matter what happens, that they'll back	7684.53	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Silicon Valley Bank.
Now, there's also, if you look at some	7688.34	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of the anecdotes, companies weren't even
set up to take money into other places.	7691.67	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Some of the founders were putting money
into their personal accounts as they	7696.35	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	were able to transfer it out.
Is there a discussion about some of	7699.56	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	these venture capital firms helping some
of their portfolio companies to actually	7702.92	4.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	meet payroll, to deal with some of their
concerns and their imminent funding	7708.65	4.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	requirements?
They're really based on the	7713.18	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	conversations I was involved in.
They really weren't.	7715.43	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That was not an option on the table.
I think that everybody was looking at	7718.28	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this and in fact, they were concerned
about the laws in California in terms of	7722.03	3.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	what happens with missing payroll.
Michael Wolff, one of the same voices	7725.99	3.99
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this weekend, he was cryptic, but
nevertheless saying was a guy named Dan	7729.98	3.57
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Loeb.
There are others.	7733.55	1.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We're a little more hysterical, all caps
and that mouthing off in a time of true	7735.38	5.4
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	financial crisis.
How do we get a behavior change in your	7740.78	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	world that affects a humility towards
the entirety of America away from hyper	7745.1	6.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	educated finance and technology elite?
Well, I think that what's happening,	7752.06	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	though, is the world is moving away.
The innovation world is already moving	7756.2	4.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	away from Silicon Valley.
It used to be you started a company, you	7761.09	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	could only be located one place, and
that was the Bay Area.	7764.48	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	In some case cases, let on.
Let's be clear.	7767.57	2.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The guy from AOL, Steve Case, is really
let on.	7769.61	2.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Absolutely.
But we move into new technologies like	7772.27	2.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	generative A.I.
and self-driving cars and even the	7775.13	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	metaverse.
It's in other places.	7778.76	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I think that that that Silicon
Valley mafia will change.	7780.71	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I didn't your Dan Loeb this weekend
talking about the metaverse and most of	7784.25	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the people watching the show were going,
Michael, what the hell is it?	7787.13	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We won't know for five years.
How do we reconnect?	7790.01	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Stanford, Caltech and other allegiance.	7793.58	5.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Georgia Tech.
Purdue.	7798.83	1.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	That's my pick in the.
CWA.	7800.27	2.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	How do we connect technology engineering
back with an America where the	7802.52	4.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	stereotype is the flat on her back?
Right.	7807.35	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think that some of it's going to come
down to innovation hubs.	7809.6	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So Boston in a lot of ways in Cambridge,
those are unique places and in other	7812.87	4.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	places around Austin and others where
you've got people.	7817.82	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And it's also opening up the world.
I mean, a lot of these tech jobs have	7822.03	3.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	gone away.
Those people are going to find work.	7825.65	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They're not going to necessarily find
work in Silicon Valley.	7827.87	2.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They're going to find it in other
companies and mainstream businesses.	7830.09	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We've been talking about the potential
fallout and the interconnectedness of	7833.63	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	markets that previously had been
somewhat separate.	7837.26	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I wonder about stable clients, for
example, the sort of crypto asset that	7839.6	4.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	is pegged to assets that, for example,
I'm thinking of the USD coin that had a	7844.19	6.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	lot of its assets parked at the Silicon
Valley Bank and suddenly it broke the	7850.28	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	buck.
Right.	7853.79	0.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It went beyond one dollar, which was
sort of the backing of its of its	7854.42	4.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	assets.
I mean, how do you view that in terms of	7859.01	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	casting a real pall that has a
permanence to it over asset classes that	7862.04	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	previously were heralded as the winners
of the crypto winter?	7865.82	3.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Yeah, I mean, they're there, by the way,
is the real arrogance, which is this	7869.54	3.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	idea that this wouldn't have happened if
we had decentralized finance and block	7872.87	5.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	chain.
Yes, USD USD coin.	7878.39	2.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's supposed to be it's a stable coin.
It's supposed to always be stable at a	7881.81	3.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	dollar.
It dropped down to 87 cents over the	7885.35	3.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	weekend and USD had three billion
dollars on deposit.	7888.41	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Right.
So it is going to have a chilling effect	7892.83	2.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	on on crypto.
It is going to make people wonder, is	7895.19	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this a viable place?
Is it safe?	7898.82	1.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	John from England e-mails in.
John says, Can you ask him if it was a	7901.28	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	bailout?
Was this a bailout for younger Michael	7905.45	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	or Turks from another time and place?
Well, I mean, this was this is very	7908.97	4.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	different.
It's a bailout, but it's very different	7913.19	1.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	than 2008.
Agree, DAX.	7915.02	1.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But why is it a bailout?
No, I think this is what this was about,	7917.02	2.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	about liquidity.
It wasn't.	7919.76	1.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is not a bank that that made risky
investments in mortgage backed	7921.41	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	securities.
This is a bank that had a liquidity	7925.61	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	problem.
They made bad mistakes in terms of their	7928.34	2.25
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	investments.
And ultimately, a lot of that money will	7930.59	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	come back.
If you see, I don't mean the A of	7934.94	2.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	running out of time.
This is too important.	7937.37	1.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	If you were asked to serve on the board
of the new SVP Bridge, what would be	7938.94	3.89
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	your advice?
I think that that you.	7942.83	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Be an expert in finance and you better
have really understand the kinds of	7945.4	5.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	credit risk officers and other people
that are in place.	7951.36	2.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Michael, we got to go because the news
is just rip roaring here as we're 30	7954.45	5.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	minutes away from the president of the
United States.	7959.49	0.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Mike, on short notice, thank you for
coming in.	7960.27	1.68
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You, Wolf, for I today, which barely
describes as history with McKinsey,	7962.49	4.47
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Yahoo!
And others.	7967.03	1.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Lisa, I was watching this as you were
talking to Michael.	7969.06	2.67
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And, you know, the phrase we use on a
normal day as there's no bid on the	7971.74	4.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	screen except it's so complex in this
crisis or there's a rip roaring bid at	7976.29	5.04
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the front end of the yield curve because
everybody just wants to pile in to seven	7981.33	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	basis points.
Michael started to our sub 4 percent.	7984.83	2.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Two year Treasury yields, the lowest
level are going back to our hotel door,	7987.81	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	three point ninety nine percent.
I come back a little bit, back around 0	7992.28	3.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	4 percent.
Even I'm looking at this and wondering	7995.86	3.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	what is the bet?
The bet is no more rate hikes and rate	7999.3	3.12
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	cuts by the end of the year at a time
when inflation still is rip roaring.	8002.42	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But as we keep hearing, conditions are
tightening.	8007.82	1.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Lending conditions are tightening.
Is it enough, though, time?	8009.5	2.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And this is really going to be the key
question, is it enough to curtail	8012.41	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	inflation that's running at the fastest
pace in 40 years?	8016.28	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	If the Fed doesn't hike anymore and even
starts cutting rates by the end of this,	8019.67	3.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	you're not going to be inflammatory
about it in terms of naming individual	8022.7	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	names and guessing what they're going to
be doing next hour or so.	8025.79	3.27
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But certainly it's very fragile into the
discussion that the president will give.	8029.84	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	What do you expect to see from the
president?	8034.0	0.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, it's got to be prepared.
Marx, does he come in and do one of	8035.66	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	those quick stand ups, walk off doing
it?	8038.24	1.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	It's going to be this is not a bailout.
This is not a bailout.	8040.16	1.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is not a bailout.
Thank you.	8042.35	1.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is going to be trying to basically
say you this is going to be an issue	8043.4	4.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	where they're going to say we did what
we had to do to make sure that these	8048.12	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	innovative companies could meet payroll.
We're going to take the actions that we	8051.52	3.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	need to to support our banking system.
But it's not a bailout.	8055.31	2.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We continue to expect combating
inflation.	8057.74	2.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Thank you.
No question.	8060.59	1.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	On radio and television, IBEX us stay
where this as we look to this.	8061.78	3.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We look to technology in this half hour.
Michael Wolff with us.	8065.36	3.15
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I'm thrilled to tell you.
No, we're not going to talk basketball.	8069.05	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Joining us, the gentleman from Bain
Capital and his senior adviser to tell	8073.43	3.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	you the last time we talked is of sport
in this crisis.	8077.17	2.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We will speak to him of the shadows of
the private markets.	8081.62	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This is Bloomberg.
Keeping you up today with news from	8085.25	6.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	around the world with the first word.
I'm Lisa Matteo.	8091.66	2.94
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	In Norway, NATO forces are gathered for
joint drills as a defense alliance along	8094.84	4.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	with Russia, China and others compete
for greater control of the Arctic.	8099.43	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Estimates suggest the region holds
around one fourth of the globe's oil and	8103.51	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	natural gas resources.
Meanwhile, Ukraine's interior minister	8107.62	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	says Russian missiles and artillery have
destroyed more than one hundred fifty	8111.43	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	two thousand residential buildings since
the start of the invasion.	8115.33	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	In his first public comments since
taking office, Premier Li Young says	8119.65	4.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	China will protect the rights of
entrepreneurs and continue to support	8123.88	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	private businesses.
He also downplayed the importance of	8127.54	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Beijing's modest economic growth target
of around 5 percent, saying citizens are	8130.84	4.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	more focused on issues that affect their
daily lives rather than the pace of the	8135.61	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	gross domestic product.
U.S., Australia and UK leaders will	8139.75	3.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	announce plans for a new fleet of
nuclear powered submarines as a deep in	8143.56	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the August Defence Partnership aimed at
countering China in the Pacific.	8148.18	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Upgrading Australia's ageing sub fleet
is a linchpin of that effort.	8152.53	4.11
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	President Biden will meet in San Diego
today with UK Prime Minister Ricci's	8156.97	3.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	tunic and Australian Prime Minister
Anthony Albanese to unveil plans to	8160.9	4.29
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	develop the new submarine.
And a film made for less than 20 million	8165.19	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	dollars was the big winner at the
Oscars, picking up best picture and six	8169.57	4.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	other trophies.
Everything everywhere all at once by	8173.8	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	independent studio.
A twenty four won out over some of the	8177.4	3.03
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	highest grossing pictures in Hollywood
history.	8180.43	2.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Avatar The Way of Water and Top Gun
Maverick, which between them have taken	8183.37	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	close to four billion dollars at the box
office.	8187.24	2.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Score just one Oscar apiece.
Global news powered by more than twenty	8189.46	4.38
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	seven hundred journalists and analysts
in over 120 countries.	8193.84	3.36
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm Lisa Mateo and this is Bloomberg.	8197.59	2.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I don't think this is likely to be a
broadly systemic problem, but it	8214.58	6.96
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	certainly is going to have very
substantial consequences for Silicon	8221.54	5.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Valley and for the economy of the whole
venture sector, which has been dynamic.	8227.24	5.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Unless
the government is able to assure that	8233.6	6.359
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this situation is worked through in the
defense of the former secretary of	8240.02	5.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	treasury, Lawrence Summers there on Wall
Street week, that was taped up a little	8245.03	4.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	bit prior to the festivities of the
weekend.	8249.74	3.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Like a lot of other people he is
monitoring, I'm sure.	8253.49	2.819
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The moment we're in tick by, tick,
ruining it to a very important voice	8256.91	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	here in a moment.
But Lisa, moments ago, the VIX over 30	8260.54	4.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	is a significant sign for equity
participants.	8264.98	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The VIX and not just our measuring
volatility in stocks, but also in bonds.	8268.04	3.8
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The move index hitting its highest
level.	8271.85	1.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Going back to early December as people
expect this volatility in bond yields to	8273.68	5.64
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	continue and potentially accelerate in
the weeks to come.	8279.32	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Some of it is a grind.
Looking to Switzerland and Zurich,	8282.95	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Credit Suisse and Swiss francs is
grinding out a new weakness.	8285.68	3.119
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We're not quite through to the record
lows seen early, early this morning.	8288.799	4.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We see it in some of the selected stocks
in finance in America as well.	8293.24	5.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I'd also point within the bond
market the dynamic of a real yield in 18	8298.61	5.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	basis points for global Wall Street, one
point to two on the real yield is a	8304.19	3.779
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	shock.
It is a highly restrictive environment.	8307.969	3.061
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Moments ago, the Bloomberg Financial
Conditions Index showing a restriction	8311.059	4.171
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of negative point eight 0.
That may be Greek to you, but the Wall	8315.23	3.659
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Street, that is a sign of a tighter
economy, a tighter finance that is	8318.889	5.631
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	something familiar in times of crisis.
To Stephen Pell, UCA.	8324.53	3.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Joining us now, senior adviser at Bain
Capital.	8328.25	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	The last time we spoke, I believe it was
of a basketball team in Boston.	8331.309	3.74
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We will not do that today and we will
speak of his crisis.	8335.059	3.451
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Steve, you are a venerable adviser to
all of technology.	8338.78	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Give us one vignette of a conversation
this weekend.	8343.4	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, many, many conversations,
all the technology firms and companies	8349.44	4.92
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	startups
were basically shaken by this event	8354.43	3.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	because probably half of them had money
with the bank.	8358.02	5.039
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And and so there was a mad scramble on
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, which	8364.02	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	basically started the contagion and
ended up with the bank in liquidation.	8368.28	3.929
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So the conversations were, you know, how
we make payroll.	8373.049	2.231
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	How do we protect our capital that we
had with what was seemingly a safe bank?	8375.299	4.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I should point out also folks are
beginning to see images of the	8380.82	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	president's speech being set up here.
A podium in the flags of the White House	8383.61	6.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	will look for that in the 9:00 o'clock
hour.	8389.94	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	To tell you, I want to talk about a new
humility, the hallmark of people like	8392.7	4.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Steve Pell UKA, a guy that owns
a football team in England.	8397.65	4.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And I think it's called the Red Sox in
Boston.	8402.54	2.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You guys had a built in humility, many
would say, that drifted away and the	8405.21	5.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	boom here and in the Biden stimulus and
the massive cash move into technology.	8410.52	5.52
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	How does the industry get back?
A new humility in crisis.	8416.43	3.71
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, you know, unfortunately, she's
gone through this several times before,	8421.68	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	as you know, you run in kind of the
crash, the tech crash in 99, which was	8425.46	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	driven by over exuberance and values and
Internet companies.	8429.72	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And this one, this one has been a little
bit similar, driven by Web three	8433.11	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	crypto bitcoins of all sorts of block
chain, all sorts of exuberance and	8438.84	6.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	prices have kind of come down.
Venture investment has slowed with this	8445.74	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	obviously too much of a supply of
anything.	8449.37	1.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You get a kind of reaction and that's
what's happened here.	8451.47	2.46
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And that contributed to the downfall of
a bank that specialize in that area.	8454.35	4.5
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We were just talking with Michael J.
Wall and we were speaking earlier with	8459.18	3.39
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Michael Shotwell, talking about tighter
lending conditions going forward for	8462.78	4.41
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	some of these smaller companies, the
venture capital world, the private	8467.19	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	equity world.
Are you seeing that among some of your	8470.82	2.79
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	portfolio companies or are you seeing
the likelihood and the expectation of it	8473.61	4.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	being more difficult to borrow?
Yes, it certainly will not be the easy	8477.75	6.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	money that doesn't include venture
capital, that includes the entire	8483.99	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	corporate world.
Interest rates are up, banks or banks	8487.65	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	are or are concerned about their
spreading yields.	8492.0	2.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So you're going to see a tightening and
we have seen that tightening as we move	8495.51	3.51
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	from a quantitative easing period where
there was easy and cheap money really	8499.04	4.75
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	back to.
I would say the new normal right now.	8503.79	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So last time we spoke, Steve, you talked
about a golden era for credit, for	8506.61	3.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	private credit, I should say, and how
this really seems like a very fruitful	8510.17	3.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	area, not only for the borrowers, but
also for the lenders.	8514.02	3.42
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Does this change your view at all at a
time when Michael Sorrell was saying	8518.73	1.86
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that potentially we could see more shoes
to drop within the private asset	8520.59	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	markets?
It does not change my view.	8524.64	2.08
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I think actually private credit will
continue to grow dramatically.	8526.87	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You know, the difference of private
credit.	8532.13	1.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Bank credit is private creditors,
sophisticated investors that put money	8533.53	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	into into funds and not like equity
investors.	8537.52	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And so if a private credit company, you
know, you lose it loses value, it only	8540.58	5.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	affects those certain investors.
That doesn't have a systemic effect on	8546.28	2.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	an economy.
And there are many, many companies that	8549.19	2.88
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that have viable loans who get those
loans through through private credit as	8552.13	5.28
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the bank market tightens up.
So.	8557.41	1.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So I'm still bullish on private credit.
What about the equity side of things in	8558.99	3.1
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	the private markets?
Again, we've come off record high equity	8562.09	6.81
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	equity amounts and injections of venture
capital, unprecedented highs.	8568.96	4.35
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And now we're back to kind of a new
normal where supply will meet demand,	8574.19	3.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	unprecedented money going in, raised all
those valuations of those of those	8577.56	4.33
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	startup companies.
I think to unsustainable levels.	8581.89	2.61
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I've been saying that for a couple of
years and now they've kind of come back	8584.56	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	down.
So so we will get back down to a	8587.29	3.3
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	baseline level with more reasonable
valuations.	8590.59	2.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I applaud the government for making this
move and insuring these deposits because	8594.1	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	this would have affected many good small
companies.	8596.86	2.77
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And so this was the move that needed to
make it on a classic bank run where the	8599.62	5.97
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	bank actually has a lot of assets.
They were just written down from	8605.59	2.48
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	accounting basis.
And and so I think really the right	8608.07	3.7
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	thing to do to stay intact.
Steve, very quickly here, we've got to	8611.77	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	go because of moving markets.
What's to tell you?	8614.98	1.95
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm fascinated at what the new internal
rate of return looks like and the new	8617.18	5.54
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	lengths of a private agreement.
Do you extend out and lower the internal	8622.72	5.58
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	rate of return or can you do better than
that coming out of crisis?	8628.3	4.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You know, if you look at the track
record of private equity and certainly	8634.05	3.63
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Bain Capital last 34 years that we've
we've maintained that about the same	8637.68	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	level of returns in the CAC go to 18 to
20 percent level for all those periods	8642.39	6.24
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	through crisis, through not crisis.
And that had very good returns for	8648.63	2.85
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	investors.
This is all an equation.	8651.48	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And when interest rates go up, as you
have you seen and companies go down and	8654.27	5.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	there'll still be companies that need
capital that need to grow.	8659.52	2.37
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And private equity has done very well.
And in driving those companies forward	8662.28	3.72
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	that continue to be so.
So return should be basically the same.	8666.24	3.9
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Steve, thank you so much to tell you
with this Bain Capital here.	8670.47	2.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Thanks for giving us ever so good.
What a what a great hour, at least	8673.59	2.82
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	talking with Michael Wolff and Steve
Powell.	8676.44	1.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You trying to get straight talk from
venerable people on what's got to be a	8678.06	5.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	changed industry coming out of this.
What's so difficult right now is the	8683.25	3.66
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	psychological impact versus
fundamentals.	8686.91	2.73
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And fundamentals are being shaken by us,
but by a psychological response.	8689.64	3.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I mean, the idea that pretty much
everyone said this wasn't a systemic	8693.33	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	event when we heard about what was going
on Thursday, Friday, and now suddenly it	8697.17	5.01
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	is systemic and it's affecting other
banks.	8702.18	2.22
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	You're seeing Schwab come out and say it
has significant liquidity, right?	8704.4	3.83
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Don't worry.
Its shares were down significantly,	8708.27	2.76
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	trying to shore up confidence.
How do you pass this out into some sort	8711.03	4.2
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	of longer term macro call on inflation?
You don't.	8715.24	3.53
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	But the answer is longer term in terms
of trust and confidence is trying to get	8718.88	3.49
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to 4:00 p.m.
this afternoon.	8722.37	1.56
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	And frankly, with Bitcoin trading 24/7
here, Bitcoin pulling back a little bit	8724.32	4.32
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	from the enthusiasms of two hours ago,
maybe that's even more sensitive with	8728.64	4.98
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	all.
I do want to point out Bloomberg	8733.62	1.59
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Technology Caroline Hyde and Edward
Ludlow will be a valuable point of	8735.21	6.06
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	resource here in the coming days.
Can't say enough about that.	8741.39	4.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Look for that on Bloomberg
Television.	8745.74	3.18
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Futures negative 51.
Dow Futures negative 391.	8749.01	2.91
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'm sorry, Lisa, there's no bid.
And Credit Suisse moments ago breaking	8752.19	3.84
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	down right on the cusp of new lows.
Two point one for Swiss francs.	8756.03	4.62
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	People are looking for what will be the
next weakest link in the banking sector	8760.74	3.78
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	to go even with some of the plans to try
to stave off some of the distress.	8764.52	4.17
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	This to me is the big question, right?
If this isn't systemic, then does this	8769.14	4.05
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	change the scenario with respect to
inflation, with respect to rate hiking	8773.19	3.45
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	at a time when you're seeing the market
price fall further, rate hikes and price	8776.64	3.93
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	in rate cuts of about 50 basis points by
the end of this year?	8780.6	3.21
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I'd like to sell forward to tomorrow and
then under retail sales, inflation	8783.84	3.87
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	tomorrow, one's retail sales Wednesday
or Thursday.	8787.71	2.14
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I don't even know.
I believe it's Friday.	8789.87	1.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We'll check.
OK.	8791.64	0.69
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Friday.
I was wrong.	8792.39	1.02
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	I was wrong twice.
They're brutal.	8793.42	1.31
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	They're typically bramble.
I'm not wrong once Emma Chandra.	8794.73	2.23
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	No, you're right.
I was wrong.	8797.02	1.34
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	So carry on.
It's Wednesday.	8798.45	1.44
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Well, it was a group.
But what we do see here, folks, as	8799.99	3.43
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	economic data.
Is it of importance to a nation in	8803.44	4.19
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	financial crisis?
Coming up in the next hour, the	8807.72	3.09
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	president of the United States with
markets open.	8810.81	3.6
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	We'll address this banking crisis.
Please stay with us.	8814.71	4.26
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Some Bloomberg Radio and Bloomberg
Television.	8818.97	2.55
Qk_a_eEA0Fs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_a_eEA0Fs	Good morning.	8822.06	0.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	hi everyone welcome to today's video so	3.659	5.281
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	markets are hitting an all-time high and	6.66	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you might be wondering yeah should we	8.94	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	invest should we sell what is it that we	10.62	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	should do so I thought that I will	12.84	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	present commentary of three big	14.58	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investors in India interestingly all	16.32	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	three of them are giving very different	19.02	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	viewpoints about the market so it is	20.58	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	better for us to understand all these	22.56	3.66
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	different perspectives and then design	24.42	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	our own investing style so that is the	26.22	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	spirit with which I'll be shooting this	28.5	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	video and the three investors that I'll	30.0	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	be speaking about would be Mr Vegeta Mr	31.92	5.94
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Mukherjee and Mr Ajay shravastava all	34.62	4.439
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	three of them have given different	37.86	3.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	viewpoints different style important	39.059	4.561
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	point to note is that when it comes to	41.1	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Big investors they do some kind of	43.62	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	hedging for their portfolio for example	45.48	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	they might take some trades in the fno	47.7	4.019
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	market they might be doing profit	49.86	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	booking regularly they might have better	51.719	4.261
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash flows management all these points	53.76	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	are not usually talked about during our	55.98	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	TV interview and we miss these points so	57.84	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	as retail investors it's very important	60.12	4.439
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	for us to hedge our risk and one of the	62.1	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	easiest ways we can hedge our race is by	64.559	4.681

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	back to the main video so let's first	122.399	3.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and foremost speak about Mr saur	124.14	3.299
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Mukherjee his General investing Style	125.579	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and what are specific sectors and stocks	127.439	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that he's bullish on so I will do stock	129.959	3.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	specific discussion also and I will give	131.58	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you my commentary on it so first and	133.8	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	foremost point about Mr Sarah Mukherjee	136.02	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is that he is a growth investor now what	137.879	4.981
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is the meaning of growth investor so for	141.12	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that let me pick the example of divis	142.86	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lab and explain that philosophy Now	145.08	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	growth investing simply means that you	147.12	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buy fundamentally good companies and you	148.92	5.52
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	do not worry too much about the price of	151.62	5.58
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the stock for example this is divis lab	154.44	5.22
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	now if you check Devi's lab and if you	157.2	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	check the fundamentals of the company	159.66	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	then what you would notice is that roce	161.22	6.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is 19.3 it is a zero debt company and	163.98	6.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the revenues profits of the company are	168.0	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	also growing right so this is a good	170.16	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	good company net net now if the	171.78	4.679
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	management is clean other things are in	173.819	5.161
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	order no red flags are there then we	176.459	4.321
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	could categorize it as a fundamentally	178.98	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	strong company so Mr Sora mukherjee's	180.78	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	viewpoint generally while investing is	183.06	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	at least to what I could decode is that	185.22	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	he will pick clean companies he will	187.14	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	pick companies where Roc is growing he	188.879	4.681
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	himself says that I look for companies	191.4	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	where the free cash flow is growing at	193.56	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	15 20 so those are his investment	195.54	4.979
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	parameters and it fits with a classic	198.3	4.92
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	growth investor now that's the good part	200.519	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that you end up picking clean companies	203.22	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	but the bad part is that you end up	205.019	4.261
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	picking them at whatever prices for	207.12	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	example as far as I know Mr Mukherjee	209.28	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	was buying disease lab here also here	211.62	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	also here also here also and he might be	213.239	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying a lot of it and the stock price	215.4	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	corrected by a lot it corrected by 40 45	217.319	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	odd percent now same thing happened with	220.14	5.459
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	HDFC EMC same thing happened with TCS in	222.299	4.621
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fact if you would have been watching my	225.599	3.181
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	videos you would categorically know that	226.92	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I was not buying TCS unless it fell to	228.78	4.92
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	like 3000 when I purchased it in bulk	231.48	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	swung trade it and sold it like around	233.7	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	33 something like that right and I was	235.86	4.799
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	out of the stock now when Nifty fell	238.08	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	again I had purchased bulk Nifty I'm	240.659	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	just sitting on it that's it right so	242.64	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what I'm trying to tell you is not that	244.379	3.061
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you know what my investing style is	246.12	2.82
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	better or my investing style is not	247.44	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	better that is not what I'm trying to do	248.94	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what I'm simply trying to tell you is	251.099	4.321
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that growth investing has certain rows	253.019	6.0
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and it also has a lot of ons that is the	255.42	5.219
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	simple message that you need to take out	259.019	3.481
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	of it and it has reflected in Mr	260.639	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	mukherjee's performance also for example	262.5	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	his PMS scheme performed really badly in	264.54	4.92
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the year 2022. so all these points you	267.06	4.5

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	making China is the best or making us is	399.06	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the best and a bit of import export	400.8	5.16
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	restrictions are put so as a result	403.56	4.259
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	export oriented businesses tend to	405.96	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	suffer right during such times this is	407.819	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	something that might happen with disease	410.28	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lab also this is the primary risk with	412.259	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the stock is it a fundamentally good	414.36	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	company solid company nothing wrong with	416.22	4.319
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the company per se valuations are also	418.319	3.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fine right for example if you take a	420.539	4.201
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	look it is already crashed by 40 45 odd	422.16	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	percent right from here to here it has	424.74	5.28
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	started to go up right here uh will I be	426.84	5.28
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying more the answer is no right so if	430.02	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I take a look at a divis lab I already	432.12	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	have it in my portfolio a little bit but	433.919	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I'm not going to buy it unless I get it	436.08	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	at even more massive discount why is	438.06	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that the case because now you might say	440.16	3.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that you know what akshat this is	441.9	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	already at a discount why are you not	443.34	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying it very simple because I see	444.96	4.139
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	better Market opportunities at this	447.18	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	juncture which are relatively less risky	449.099	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	for me where I can do domestic	451.38	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	consumption play for example if I take a	453.599	4.201
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	look at cards company or if I take a	456.0	3.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	look at insurance company and for	457.8	3.299
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	example many of you might be watching my	459.419	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	videos for a while and you would know	461.099	3.241
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that I have been very bullish on HDFC	462.479	3.421
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	live so that has started to give a	464.34	3.479
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	massive run up so I'm more bullish on	465.9	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	these themes at this juncture this does	467.819	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	not make dv's lab a bad stock for me but	470.22	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I am sitting somewhere in the middle	472.319	3.241
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	where I see better Market opportunities	473.52	4.019
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	right now so I would rather put new	475.56	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	money in something like this this is my	477.539	3.301
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	personal belief my personal opinion	479.28	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Pharma stocks are going to do well	480.84	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	subsequently no doubt about that but if	482.639	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I take a look at PE it's not as if that	484.62	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I'm getting like very cheap PE at this	486.479	3.301
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	juncture this is not even like	488.34	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	pre-covered PE at which I'm getting so	489.78	3.66
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it's not as if that these stocks have	491.699	3.241
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	become like relatively very less	493.44	3.479
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	expensive I had already built some	494.94	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	positions in it I will continue to hold	496.919	3.481
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it someday they are going to go up if I	498.66	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	take one two year viewpoint but putting	500.4	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in new money I will refrain from them	502.56	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	same commentary applies to Dr Lal patla	504.12	4.019
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that had purchased it when it has fallen	506.52	3.119
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	quite a bit built my position now I'm	508.139	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	holding tight little bit of loss here	509.639	3.181
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and there but it's not as if that you	511.199	3.181
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	know what my positions are such that you	512.82	2.88
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	know I will start threading so what	514.38	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	about Metro Health so this is a slightly	515.7	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	different company let me share some	517.44	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	quick data points around it so you'll	519.0	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	see that debt to equity is 27 so debt is	520.74	5.76
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fairly High it is a mid to small cap	523.74	5.46
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	type of a company if you take a look at	526.5	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	its fundamentals right what you will see	529.2	3.66
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is that see sales growth has happened	531.12	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	but profit growth has not happened	532.86	5.22
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	proportionally for example 2019 data if	535.08	6.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you see the sales was at 761 profit was	538.08	6.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	124 but if you check 2022 2023 sales	541.44	5.22
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	have gone up massively but has the	544.86	3.599
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	profits gone up proportionally the	546.66	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	answer is no so this looks like a debt	548.459	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fueled growth I typically avoid such	550.68	3.839
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	companies unless there is a very clear	552.779	3.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	perspective there is a very clear	554.519	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	product Market fit so I am not right now	556.62	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investing in it but how having said this	559.019	4.801
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	small cap medicines right hand small cap	561.3	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Medicap stocks are going to perform	563.82	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	really well so maybe Metro Health will	565.26	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	perform quite good now since I've	567.24	3.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	already built a lot of positions in	568.98	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	other small cap Medicap companies in a	570.48	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	more Diversified manner as you can need	572.339	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in EA that I have to go and invest my	574.26	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	money in like Metro Health and take like	576.06	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	crazy bets on it without any substantial	577.68	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	data so for now I'm not buying Metro	579.66	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Health so now let me talk about two non	581.459	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Pharma picks that Mr Sarah Mukherjee	583.74	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	gave so one was alkala means he's	585.779	3.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	already an investor in it it's a solid	587.64	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	gum so I had a bit of it I sold it I'm	589.62	5.46
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	looking to re-enter it so will I be	592.32	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying it at this juncture let me	595.08	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	quickly discuss that see it's a solid	597.12	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	company I don't even need to take you to	598.68	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	profit margins and all that stuff you	600.42	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	guys are smart enough now very quickly	601.98	4.919
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	let me comment on the valuations the	604.2	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	valuation seems okay at this juncture I	606.899	3.421
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	don't think that there is anything	609.3	3.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	majorly off the stock has already	610.32	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	corrected by 45 it's a Specialty	612.48	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Chemicals play and the recent numbers	614.88	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	are also both in terms of profits and	616.38	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	revenue so netnet it's a good company No	618.42	3.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Doubt about that I will not get into	620.22	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	massive details here what I will simply	621.959	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	leave you with is the fact that by this	624.06	5.04
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	company only when it is around its 200	626.459	7.021
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	dma so this is 200 dma right if you're	629.1	6.179
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	looking to buy now build new possessions	633.48	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	on it it's probably an okay time this	635.279	3.601
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	was a great time to build positions no	637.44	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	doubt about that but now is probably an	638.88	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	okay time I will wait I'm not going to	641.339	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	build my positions immediately on	643.86	3.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	something like alkala means and why	645.48	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	again I explained you earlier that I see	647.399	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	better opportunities in markets	649.68	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	elsewhere so I don't need to necessarily	651.3	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	get into Specialty Chemicals race out of	653.1	4.799
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	now but in case I get like a bulk buying	655.74	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	opportunity I might do it subsequently	657.899	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in the future so that is my commentary	659.76	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	on alkala means but if you want a	661.62	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	diversification if your portfolio is	663.3	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	actually too much Finance too much it is	665.04	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	there all that stuff want to build	667.26	4.259
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	position and Specialty Chemicals good	669.66	3.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stock I think valuations are also	671.519	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	sensible and this juncture unlikely that	673.079	3.661
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you're going to suffer like massive	675.48	3.299
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	losses from this juncture at least it	676.74	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	looks like right now comes the final	678.779	2.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	point	680.1	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	spoke about so this was regarding Titan	681.079	5.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	now Titan is a very interesting story I	683.82	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	have gotten so many queries that should	686.579	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	be by Titan should we not buy Titan so	688.44	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	let me quickly present my analysis there	690.48	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	see Titan is fundamentally a very good	692.22	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	company no problem there but here is the	694.38	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	problem right the problem is the	696.6	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	evaluation and the classic growth	698.1	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investing theory if you are investing in	700.32	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Titan here then you must have a very	702.36	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	clear understanding why Titan will keep	704.04	5.58
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	on going up in prices at a fairly good	706.38	5.519
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	rate okay so for this you need to know a	709.62	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	little bit of History why did the Titans	711.899	5.281
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	prices go up recently one was the	714.3	6.12
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	increase in gold now why what does gold	717.18	5.159
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	prices have to do with Titan okay so	720.42	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Titan is like jewelry maker watchmaker	722.339	5.641
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it holds a lot of gold and the life	725.04	5.039
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cycle of gold is fairly big for example	727.98	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	if you are looking to buy a Titan watch	730.079	5.341
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in 2023 then in order to make that watch	732.0	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Titan would have to start the process	735.42	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	from 2021 it will have to procure gold	737.1	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it will to process gold make watch	739.86	5.52
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	deliver it distribute it Market it and	742.2	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	then finally you will get to buy it	745.38	3.12
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	after one and a half two years so	746.7	3.66
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	there's a fairly long cycle that the	748.5	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	gold procurement for whatever you are	750.36	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	seeing now would have been done in 2021	752.22	5.82
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and that is reflecting in 2023 and how	754.62	5.399
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	much has the gold prices gone up by in	758.04	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the last two years at quite an	760.019	4.801
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	aggressive Pace gold Cycles are fairly	761.82	5.4
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	long term in nature they take like 10 10	764.82	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	years to transpire so please understand	767.22	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that that because a bull run has	769.32	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	happened in Gold Plus the fact that	771.54	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stock market Bull Run is somewhat	774.18	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	happening right now it's very unlikely	775.92	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that gold is also going to run or	777.899	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	continue to run at the same Pace it as	779.7	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it has over the last one and a half	781.62	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	years and this will definitely slow down	783.06	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the growth of Titan this is 0.1 your	785.16	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	second question would be that okay gold	787.44	4.199
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	price are not going up maybe they will	789.54	3.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	be able to increase the product prices	791.639	3.661
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and increase the number of units sold	793.079	4.621
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	yes that might very well happen but	795.3	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	price rise in Titan products has already	797.7	4.139
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	happened quite aggressively over the	799.92	3.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	last one and a half two years why	801.839	3.481
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	because again the price of gold went up	803.459	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so their inventory also benefited and	805.32	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	their pricing strategy also benefited	807.899	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	because let's say they had procured gold	809.76	5.4
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	at let's say 100 rupees a unit in 2021	812.639	5.221
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	right now at the time of selling it what	815.16	4.799
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is the value of that asset or the value	817.86	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that they are holding for example they	819.959	4.201
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	bought like let's say 1000 ton of gold	822.06	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	okay hypothetically speaking I'm picking	824.16	3.859
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	like simpler examples	825.959	4.981
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	they are right right 500 they are left	828.019	6.161
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	with so this also is valued at 2023	830.94	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	prices right so that's one benefit	834.18	5.04
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	second is that the 500 units that they	835.8	5.099
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	have processed for gold they have made	839.22	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	watch out of it for that also they are	840.899	3.12
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	going to increase the price	843.18	2.64
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	proportionally right it's not as if that	844.019	4.021
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you're going to get like gold watch at	845.82	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lower rates compared to what the raw	848.04	3.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	gold prices are so I don't think that	849.66	3.239
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the prices are going to go up quite	851.579	2.88
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	aggressively at least for the next one	852.899	3.781
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	two years but see very recently there	854.459	4.801
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	was a gold price play there was a price	856.68	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	play there was a point play all three	859.26	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	benefited Titan but going forward cryton	861.42	5.52
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is likely to benefit only from qplay not	864.24	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the other two things at least for a	866.94	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	short period so I am not going to invest	868.68	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	my money unless I get this stock at	870.36	5.539
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	below its 200 day moving average	872.399	6.0
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you will not be able to invest in this	875.899	4.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	ever let it be I'm not bothered right so	878.399	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	there are enough opportunities in the	880.74	3.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	market so I will probably catch those	882.3	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fishes rather than running after this so	883.98	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that is my perspective important points	886.199	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that you need to take away from Mr Sarah	888.36	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	mukherjee's commentary is that he is	889.92	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fully invested in the market 100 he's	892.079	3.541
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying more he's bullish about the	894.18	2.88
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stocks that he had already talked about	895.62	3.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and it looks like that he will continue	897.06	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to make investments in all of these	898.8	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stocks so that is what I could get from	900.42	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	his commentary I'd explain you his pros	902.699	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	and cons now you make a call as per your	904.5	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	understanding so now let's move on to	906.66	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the second investor which is Mr Ajay	908.279	3.541
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	shravasta he's not very active on social	910.019	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	media so you might not know about him so	911.82	4.319
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	here is his very quick background so he	914.16	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	has a graduate from I am Bangalore he	916.139	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	had Investment Banking experience he	918.18	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	runs it's a consulting firm right now	919.86	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	has a good portfolio and he has	921.54	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	presented a slightly negative commentary	923.579	4.741
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so let me first read out his three four	925.68	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	statements first statement is that	928.32	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	reality is uglier than what screens are	930.48	5.219
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	showing number two markets have run	933.12	5.399
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	ahead of its fundamentals at this point	935.699	5.76
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Specialty Chemicals PE has gone up to	938.519	6.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	250 to 60. all valid concerns and this	941.459	6.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is absolutely true so his eventual piece	945.42	3.479
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	of advice was that you know what	947.639	3.241
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investors should have a little bit of	948.899	4.021
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash positions and he is not fully	950.88	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	invested in the market he's building his	952.92	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash positions so that is something that	954.42	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investors should consider approaching as	956.699	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	well there are specific sectors where he	958.74	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is bullish there are specific sectors	961.019	3.601
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	where he is bearish so I'll explain	963.12	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	those viewpoints also but very quickly	964.62	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	let me cover the point about building	966.72	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash positions because this is one way	968.579	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in which big investors hedge their	970.5	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	portfolio see there are two types of	972.72	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investors in the market one would be	974.459	4.221
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	your typical mutual fund investors	976.44	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	everyone we are going to put like 10 000	978.68	4.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	rupees and you know x amount of rupees	981.06	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buy and forget never book profit so this	982.92	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is one set of investors okay they are	985.32	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	like buy and forget type they don't make	987.24	3.839
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	huge amount of money to be honest right	989.279	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	compared to second set of slightly more	991.079	4.681
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	intelligent investors which act as per	993.24	5.219
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	opportunities now how can you act as per	995.76	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	opportunity as well you will be able to	998.459	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	do it if you have cash flows so let me	1000.56	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	give you my example so let's say	1002.959	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	hypothetically what I do right now in	1004.459	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the market is that I will be roughly 100	1006.68	5.04
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	invested in the market okay now every	1008.6	5.159
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	month if I'm making a cash flow of 5	1011.72	4.739
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lakh five lakh five lakh right then even	1013.759	5.161
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	if the market goes down I can plug this	1016.459	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash flow here and I will be able to	1018.92	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	downward average it so this allows me to	1021.259	4.741
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	take advantage of more opportunities so	1023.6	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	when people give advice that you know	1026.0	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what you should be away from the market	1027.679	4.201
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	or you should be 80 invested or 20	1029.36	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	invested it all comes down to one single	1031.88	4.559
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	factor which is cash flow what is your	1034.22	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cash flow like if you have a good cash	1036.439	4.921
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	flow then you can be 100 invested in the	1038.54	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	market right now for example I am almost	1041.36	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	100 invested in the market right now	1043.22	3.959
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	with the understanding that you know	1045.26	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what my cash flows are clear I will be	1047.179	3.541
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	able to make new money and plow it back	1048.919	4.621
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	in case the opportunities arises if you	1050.72	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	are of the view care then I am not going	1053.54	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to get a lot of cash flows in the next	1055.16	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	few months then probably it makes tends	1056.6	6.0
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to be 85 90 invested keep 10 money handy	1059.0	6.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	this 10 money should always be handy	1062.6	5.16
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	with you if you don't have cash flows I	1065.419	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	hope I was able to communicate this	1067.76	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	point so this is a fairly important risk	1069.14	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	mitigation point that is adopted by a	1071.36	4.439
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lot of big investors okay so very	1073.7	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	quickly coming back to Mr Desh ravastha	1075.799	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what is he bullish and bearish about so	1077.78	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	let me take you through that so he is	1080.299	5.161
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	bullish about all these different themes	1082.52	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the First theme is bullish about is	1085.46	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	hotels then Airlines then defends	1087.38	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	infrastructure New Age companies do I	1089.6	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	agree no right here why so think about	1091.94	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it this way and I'll explain these	1093.98	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	economics here so it's all our	1095.299	4.561
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	government money spending game right so	1097.28	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	government money spending aim for	1099.86	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	example if the government increases its	1101.36	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	expenditure over the next one one and a	1103.64	4.08
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	half years which it is likely to because	1105.62	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it's an election year then of course all	1107.72	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	these industries will go up no doubt	1110.12	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	about that but again what ends up	1111.98	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	happening here is that all these bits	1114.26	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	for you are highly concentrated beds for	1116.0	5.039
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	example if you are investing in a real	1119.12	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	estate also if you are investing in	1121.039	3.721
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	hotel companies also you are buying a	1123.08	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	flat also you are buying in defense also	1124.76	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	then what is that single Factor you're	1127.22	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	betting on government spending now if it	1128.72	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	does not meet the market expectation all	1131.24	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	these sectors are not going to rally and	1133.52	3.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you might end up having a very	1135.14	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	concentrated portfolio and you might end	1136.76	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	up taking a lot of hit so please realize	1138.98	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that in my case I'm not investing	1141.74	4.319
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	anything in like real estate companies	1143.96	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	why because I directly invest in real	1146.059	3.061
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	estate I've been doing it for the last	1147.74	2.88
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	one one and a half years I am already	1149.12	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	sitting on like 20 profits on some of my	1150.62	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	real estate investments in less than a	1153.02	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	year why is that because it was a great	1154.94	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	time to swing the real estate in a way	1157.22	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I'm have no intention of selling it it	1158.9	4.019
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	was a good cycle for me so I purchased	1161.12	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it I identify really good investment	1162.919	3.601
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	opportunities and I plan on holding that	1164.6	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	real estate for me that's a cash flow	1166.52	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	game that's not a trading game so	1168.38	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	anyways coming here basically what you	1170.12	3.66
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	would be doing in case you end up	1172.34	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investing in these themes is that you	1173.78	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	would end up exposing your portfolio a	1175.88	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lot to infrastructure which is not a	1178.1	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	very sensible move little bit if you	1180.26	3.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	want to do do it but don't go super	1181.94	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	crazy in terms of these individual	1183.5	3.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	breaks another way of thinking about it	1185.24	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is that if the capital expenditure picks	1187.46	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	up that banks are also going to disburse	1189.86	4.319
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	more loans that will make it profitable	1192.02	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so if you want to lower your risk then	1194.179	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	probably picking undervalued Banks might	1195.799	4.561
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	make more sense which are undervalued	1198.14	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	banks right now I will create a separate	1200.36	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	list on member Community tab of YouTube	1202.039	3.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	If you are a serious investor you could	1203.96	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	consider joining it I explained all the	1205.88	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	points fundamentally there write out	1208.28	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	everything and give very timely	1210.32	3.359
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	information so with that said let me	1211.82	3.54
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	explain what he's bearish about and add	1213.679	3.841
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	my commentary on that so he is bearish	1215.36	5.64
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	about low end retail he is generally you	1217.52	5.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	know bearish about retail companies	1221.0	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	fertilizer Commodities so Commodities	1222.94	4.96
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	100 I had already sort of said last year	1225.14	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that I had sold all my commodity stocks	1227.9	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	commodity is a cycle gold is the only	1229.76	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	commodity that is somewhat performing	1232.46	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	still but all the other Commodities are	1234.38	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	not they're cooling off right so no	1236.539	4.201
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Point here right low end retail I	1238.4	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	completely agree that when it comes to	1240.74	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	these signaling products for example	1243.14	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	when you own an iPhone you will flaunt	1245.24	3.72
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it when you own a Mac you might flaunt	1247.039	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	it but probably if you own a redmi or a	1248.96	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Dell you might not flaunt it so we are	1251.179	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	quickly reaching that society which is	1253.34	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	status driven so low end retail	1255.08	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	generally from a long-term perspective	1257.24	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	might not be a very sensible move as	1258.799	5.161
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	long-term investors uh I'll not	1261.08	4.86
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	commentate here and this I don't know to	1263.96	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	be honest so I'm just letting you know	1265.94	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	right so from this perspective I don't	1267.26	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	know but the key takeaway from Mr Ajay	1269.0	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	srivastav's commentary is that be	1271.28	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	prepared for a market Fall that can	1273.38	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	happen and I 100 agree with me for me	1275.059	4.561
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the way I am mitigating that is by	1277.58	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	managing my cash flows that is something	1279.62	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that I am looking at you can also do	1281.299	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Bond investing as I previously said	1283.64	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that's one way of mitigating risk and	1285.44	3.719
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	probably I will come up with a separate	1287.66	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	video on risk hedging strategy now let's	1289.159	3.661
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	move on to the third investor and my	1290.96	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	favorite investor right now which is Mr	1292.82	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Vijay kedia I absolutely love the person	1294.44	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	simply because he's like you know enjoy	1296.84	3.839
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	enjoying life singing zones what not so	1298.34	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you like you know much smaller type so I	1300.679	4.081
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	really love that attitude about his	1302.78	3.899
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	style of living life more than anything	1304.76	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	else that's one second key thing if you	1306.679	5.041
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	are trying to emulate Mr Vijay KDs time	1309.08	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	please understand what type of an	1311.72	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investor he is he is a high risk High	1313.46	5.579
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	reward type of an investor now what is	1315.74	4.799
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the meaning of high-risk higher what	1319.039	3.661
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	type of an investor so for that you need	1320.539	4.441
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to understand the VC game or venture	1322.7	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	capitalist game now what our VC does is	1324.98	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that for example a VC would go and	1326.96	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	invest one one lakh rupee in 100	1329.12	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	companies with the understanding that 80	1330.86	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	of them are going to die but the 20 that	1333.44	5.04
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	remains they are going to 10x in size so	1335.96	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	if you run the math you will see here at	1338.48	5.46
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	C company 20 go by 10 so that gives me	1340.22	6.12
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	how much 200 so my 100 unit of	1343.94	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Investments becomes 200 units of	1346.34	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investment despite 80 companies time so	1348.32	4.68
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that is Mr Vijay KDs style of investing	1351.02	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	as per my understanding what he does is	1353.0	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that he buys a lot of midi caps small	1355.34	4.819
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cap companies he	1357.38	2.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I buy like companies that are like you	1360.88	5.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	know just starting out so to say they	1364.159	3.181
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	should have the hunger to grow so he	1365.9	2.94
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	uses something called a smile framework	1367.34	2.94
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so I will just put it here what does	1368.84	3.3
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that mean so that is his style of	1370.28	4.259
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	investing if you have that level of risk	1372.14	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	appetite his style of investing will	1374.539	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	make sense but please understand that	1376.46	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you are playing the VC game do I do that	1378.919	4.74
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	yes a fraction of my portfolio is	1381.44	4.44
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	designed in such a way for example I had	1383.659	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	purchased zomato I had purchased uipath	1385.88	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	I purchased coinbase that part of my	1388.159	4.681
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	portfolio follows Mr Vijay kedia's style	1390.38	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	of investing but majority of my	1392.84	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	portfolio does not follow that so you	1394.58	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	need to contextualize what to pick from	1396.86	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	every investor that is what I am trying	1399.38	3.6
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to teach you through this video so what	1401.24	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is his Viewpoint about the market right	1402.98	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	now so he seems to be 100 invested in	1404.6	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	the market he has purchased or built his	1406.82	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	position quite early he is neither	1409.22	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	buying neither selling anything and yeah	1411.38	3.779
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so that's what he's doing right so he's	1413.6	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	just relaxing he has said that you know	1415.159	3.541
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what there is time to be activated the	1417.02	3.18
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	market then there is time to be	1418.7	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	selective in the market and there is	1420.2	3.06
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	time to be inactive in the market so	1421.76	3.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	he's somewhat in that inactive stage at	1423.26	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	this juncture that he's not doing	1425.179	3.961
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	anything he's just waiting for his seats	1426.62	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	to sprout and become like good trees and	1429.14	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	then he will think what to do this story	1430.88	4.679
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	works out greatly for him for example if	1432.799	4.681
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	you understand one of his stories which	1435.559	4.141
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	is called as Sarah sanitaryware so	1437.48	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that's a stock that he picked when it	1439.7	3.599
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	was at three and a half rupees or four	1441.62	4.32
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	rupees somewhere in 2003. right now the	1443.299	5.041
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stock trades at 8 000 rupees now if you	1445.94	4.56
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	are new to investing you'll say yeah	1448.34	4.02
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	great right three and a half maybe	1450.5	4.2
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	picked eight thousand right now it's not	1452.36	3.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	as if that he would have picked that	1454.7	3.42
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stock and you slept on it he would have	1455.84	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	selectively booked profit this is	1458.12	3.24
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	something that he says also that is not	1459.919	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	iBook profit on that stock he would have	1461.36	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	intelligently designed curtailed his	1464.059	4.021
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	portfolio by edging his other bets so	1465.86	4.199
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	how does this entire math moves so let	1468.08	3.36
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	me give you very quick commentary there	1470.059	2.761
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	so let's say that he invested like 1	1471.44	3.599
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	lakh rupee and Sarah Senator ran in 2003	1472.82	4.8
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	okay now then there was a bull rally his	1475.039	4.62
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	one lakh became what two lakh rupees so	1477.62	3.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what he would have done is that he would	1479.659	3.301
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	have booked like 50 profit he would have	1481.039	3.421
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	kept that one lakh rupee yeah my	1482.96	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	principle is sorted now let me just keep	1484.46	4.26
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	this one line rupee intact and Let Me	1486.74	3.419
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Wait and watch then that Sarah's	1488.72	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	entryway kept on going up up and up so	1490.159	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	what that allows you to do is that that	1492.86	4.14
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	allows you to witness the downfall and	1494.659	4.621
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	not get paid by he himself goes on to	1497.0	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	say that after every Bull Run ends Sarah	1499.28	6.12
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	sanitary were corrects by 50 to 70 you	1501.98	5.1
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	cannot stomach that level of volatility	1505.4	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	unless you have booked some profit so	1507.08	3.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	that is his style of investing please	1509.24	4.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	pick up that from him and with that said	1510.98	4.98
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	let me show you some of the pics that he	1513.62	4.5
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	has made and which are his biggest bets	1515.96	4.199
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	right now so this is what he has picked	1518.12	5.48
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	this season so affordable robotics	1520.159	6.9
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	engineering Precision neuraland he has	1523.6	5.38
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	also sold something called as ramco or	1527.059	3.901
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	Tejas there is no point in me doing this	1528.98	3.78
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	stock analysis probably I'll make a	1530.96	4.079
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	separate small cap mid cap video which	1532.76	4.14

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	time grasping the entire thing	1544.64	3.659
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	overarching Viewpoint that Mr Vijay	1546.14	3.84
5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	kedia holds right now is that he's	1548.299	3.841

5Vxe0zhmoC0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vxe0zhmoC0	reasons I also feel that credit economy	1552.14	3.48

ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	description and comment box so with that	155.52	4.02
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	said let us begin our topic and first	157.5	4.44
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	and foremost let us truly understand the	159.54	4.44
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	concept of gold Returns versus Equity	161.94	4.32
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	returns in a more fundamental manner so	163.98	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	just a while back I had shown you this	166.26	3.54
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	chart that if you consider gold returns	167.94	3.84
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	from 2019 and this shows the returns	169.8	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	till 2021 and as of now the gold prices	171.78	5.58
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	are roughly 6200 per gram so if you	174.3	5.4
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	consider the story from here you will	177.36	3.44
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	see	179.7	3.42
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	in the last four years the gold has	180.8	5.2
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	given 100 returns and this is what a lot	183.12	4.68
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	of gold based organizations that want	186.0	3.42
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you to put your money in Gold are	187.8	4.079
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	showing you but understand the story	189.42	4.62
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	further for example when was this Prize	191.879	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	last existing so you could argue that	194.04	5.339
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	this price had existed back in 2013 also	196.379	5.94
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that back in 2013 gold had peaked to	199.379	5.881
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	3000 rupees per gram levels and if you	202.319	5.34
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	consider now the last 10 years returns	205.26	4.559
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	of gold it comes out to be a humbling	207.659	4.921
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	less than 10 because if you do the	209.819	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	kagger analysis then it will come out to	212.58	4.2
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	be less than 10 so yes if you consider	214.319	4.92
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	like last Fourier returns okay brilliant	216.78	4.26
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	hundred percent returns but last 10	219.239	3.841
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	years has been less than 10 percent so	221.04	3.9
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	this is the first key Point regarding	223.08	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	returns that you need to understand that	224.94	3.84
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you need to consider the Horizon of	227.04	3.9
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	returns many people make the argument	228.78	4.26
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that okay not gold brilliant asset go	230.94	4.379
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	and invest look at the last Fourier	233.04	3.6
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	performance and then you will get	235.319	3.301
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	convinced higher brilliant it's it's	236.64	4.019
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	like an asset that you need to have on	238.62	3.539
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	the flip side if you consider slightly	240.659	2.881
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	longer term you will get a different	242.159	3.601
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	story so don't get swayed by either of	243.54	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	these arguments understand that when you	245.76	3.3
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	are putting your money whether in Gold	247.5	3.9
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	equities bonds whatever asset you want	249.06	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	to put your money on you need to	251.4	3.419
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	consider your time Horizon more	253.14	3.719
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	holistically so with that said let me	254.819	3.6
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	give you a slightly more broader	256.859	3.0
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Viewpoint and show you two three more	258.419	3.72
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	data points so if you consider the last	259.859	4.681
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	50 year history of gold and here I am	262.139	3.78
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	considering the World prices and	264.54	3.42
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	comparing it to the U.S data the reason	265.919	3.901
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	there is that the data in the US or	267.96	3.9
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Market data from the US is slightly more	269.82	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	cleaner and the same Trend will be	271.86	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	represented in India so what you will	273.9	3.66
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	notice is that if you consider the last	275.82	4.439
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	50 year returns and this captures 2022	277.56	5.34
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	also then it is very simple that U.S	280.259	6.181
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	stocks have given roughly 10.21 in India	282.9	5.82
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	if you consider Nifty and calculate the	286.44	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	last 20 year kagger it will come out to	288.72	4.14
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	be roughly 12 to 13 right so it will be	290.52	3.78
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	higher why is that because Indian	292.86	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	currency INR it depreciates so net net	294.3	4.44
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	in Arbitrage terms it comes out to be	296.82	4.14
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	similar on the flip side if you consider	298.74	5.54
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Commodities like Commodities means	300.96	5.88
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	all these are Commodities so here the	304.28	3.88
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	returns is eight point three percent	306.84	4.859
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	gold has given 7.78 so please compare	308.16	7.979
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	this this 10.21 with 7.78 as the last 50	311.699	6.241
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	year history this is what the long-term	316.139	3.661
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	data tells us let's go even further	317.94	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	let's analyze Trends within this long	319.8	4.32
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	term so for this let me take you to this	321.9	3.66
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	particular chart and I will put the	324.12	3.18
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	links in the description box you	325.56	4.02
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	yourself can go and check it out and	327.3	4.8
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	this does a comparative analysis of	329.58	5.04
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	investing in the markets stocks versus	332.1	4.74
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	gold okay so this becomes even more	334.62	3.54
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	interesting and there are two three	336.84	3.299
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	trends that I would like to outline that	338.16	3.84
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	will help you cultivate a fundamental	340.139	4.141
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	understanding about this topic so what	342.0	3.72
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you would notice is that this Orange	344.28	3.54
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Line indicates gold returns that if you	345.72	4.62
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	consider for example this point 1983	347.82	5.52
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Gold and equities used to work almost	350.34	5.16
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	similarly there used to be somewhat of	353.34	3.9
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	an inverse relationship between the two	355.5	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	but the amount of returns both these	357.24	4.679
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	asset class is used to give was somewhat	359.46	5.1
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	similar then what happened after 1980s	361.919	4.681
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	well the thing called as money printing	364.56	4.62
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	or debegging of gold as the standard	366.6	4.8
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	currency happened that the world moved	369.18	4.38
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	away from gold standard and it moved to	371.4	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Fiat standard as we see today so any	373.56	4.68
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	government has the power of printing as	375.9	4.079
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	much money as they like and the US	378.24	3.179
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	government has started printing like	379.979	3.06
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	crazy so because of which one could	381.419	3.78
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	argue that the stock price returns after	383.039	5.1
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	1980 so this is a chart there has been a	385.199	4.921
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	very clear Divergence that these stock	388.139	4.321
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	prices went up like crazy but the gold	390.12	4.32
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	price is somewhat flatlined in this	392.46	4.2
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	entire zone so when did this narrative	394.44	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	change so let me highlight this with a	396.66	4.02
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	separate color that this narrative	398.52	5.1
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	started changing after 2008 onwards	400.68	4.799
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	there was a sudden spike in the gold	403.62	5.12
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	prices after 2008 and all the way till	405.479	6.601
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	2016-17 and then it flatlined again and	408.74	5.14
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	then again it started Rising somewhere	412.08	4.739
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	around 2019 onwards so three specific	413.88	5.039
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	zones this is Zone number one right	416.819	4.141
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	where we spoke about the fact that okay	418.919	4.381
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	D pegging of gold this is Zone number	420.96	5.579
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	two post 2008 all the way till 2016-17	423.3	5.48
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	and this is Zone number three after	426.539	5.28
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	2019. so there are brief periods when	428.78	5.139
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	gold has given very strong returns but	431.819	4.32
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	on the flip side if you compare the	433.919	4.321
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	returns of stocks over a long time	436.139	4.981
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Horizon especially after 1980 you will	438.24	5.34
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	see a very secular bold Trend yes of	441.12	3.72
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	course the market has corrected for	443.58	3.3
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	example it has corrected here here here	444.84	4.919
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	but long term if you simply eyeball this	446.88	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	chart you will get a very clear	449.759	3.421
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	understanding that investing in equity	450.96	4.32
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	has been a bigger wealth generator	453.18	4.62
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	compared to investing in gold so with	455.28	4.259
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that said let me help you further break	457.8	3.54
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	down this topic and help you understand	459.539	4.321
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	this entire concept of investing in gold	461.34	4.799
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	more fundamentally now this is a very	463.86	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	good summary of what investing in gold	466.139	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	is like and if you don't have a lot of	468.36	3.3
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	time just read through this summary it	470.099	3.6
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	will give you a lot of understanding so	471.66	4.14
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	for example goal has been considered a	473.699	3.961
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	store of value I will explain what sour	475.8	3.66
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	of value means over the long term	477.66	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	however both stocks and bonds have	479.46	4.62
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	beaten and outperformed price increase	481.74	4.14
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	in gold this we have seen from a long	484.08	4.14
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	term perspective over certain short span	485.88	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	of times again I had explained you three	488.22	3.66
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	phases where gold has done fairly well	489.96	3.78
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	and I will explain you the reason behind	491.88	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that also but it is true that there will	493.74	4.079
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	be some periods or brief periods in	495.96	3.48
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	history when gold will do exceptionally	497.819	3.6
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	well and right now we are in one such	499.44	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	period Then the gold tend to rise during	501.419	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	periods of high inflation and	503.94	4.02
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	geopolitical uncertainty this is again a	505.379	4.38
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	very important point and I will break it	507.96	3.54
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	down so if you understand these three	509.759	3.84
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	four points and absorb it you will have	511.5	3.959
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	a much better fundamental understanding	513.599	3.961
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	as to when you should be buying gold and	515.459	3.901
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	when you should be selling gold so let	517.56	3.599
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	me further help you consolidate these	519.36	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	points so gold prices go up because of	521.159	5.101
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	three specific reasons one is that if	523.86	4.56
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	there is increased risk in the world	526.26	4.62
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	then people flock towards a safer asset	528.42	5.64
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	or fixed Supply assets like gold now	530.88	4.98
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	this has been the case over the last one	534.06	3.12
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	and a half two years because there has	535.86	3.3
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	been Russia Ukraine war there has been a	537.18	4.74
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	lot of problems at a World level kovid	539.16	4.799
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	act as a destabilizer for the entire	541.92	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	world and people generally saw more	543.959	4.021
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	specifically investors really saw that	545.88	4.26
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you know what risk has gone up in the	547.98	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	world so as a result two things happened	550.14	3.84
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	one is that there was a spike in gold	551.94	4.019
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	prices that brief period that we were	553.98	3.78
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	earlier speaking about and second key	555.959	3.781
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	thing was that even currencies like US	557.76	3.9
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	dollar got strengthened because think	559.74	3.48
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	about it this way that people usually	561.66	2.88
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	say that you know what the money	563.22	2.76
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	branding is others are even more money	564.54	3.239
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	is printed then gold should go up is	565.98	4.919
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that no it's the search for safer assets	567.779	5.281
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that happens due to the increasing	570.899	4.321
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	riskiness in the world so safer assets	573.06	3.779
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	one could argue would be something like	575.22	3.9
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	gold safer asset could also be something	576.839	4.381
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	like USD so therefore USD has	579.12	3.839
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	strengthened compared to a lot of other	581.22	3.84
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	currencies but yes I hope you got the	582.959	3.781
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	first picture that okay why is it that	585.06	3.6
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	the gold prices go up because the risk	586.74	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	in the world has gone up and that has	588.66	3.72
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	been the case for the last one and a	590.82	3.84
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	half two years second key case is that	592.38	4.8
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	yes inflation does impact the prices of	594.66	4.739
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	gold why is that the case because see if	597.18	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	let's say there are 100 trillion dollars	599.399	4.021
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that are flowing on in the economy now	601.14	4.139
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	suddenly the U.S decides that we are	603.42	3.539
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	going to double the money supply and	605.279	3.901
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	they almost increase the money supply by	606.959	4.44
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	a lot over the last couple of years so	609.18	3.42
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	what would people think that people	611.399	2.641
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	would think yeah you know what I was	612.6	4.32
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	having a lot of this paper money now	614.04	4.44
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	government is printing more and more	616.92	3.78
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	they are just devaluing because whenever	618.48	4.26
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	there is more of something it's get	620.7	3.78
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	devalue now this is a concept that I	622.74	3.599
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	have spoken quite extensively on some of	624.48	3.66
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	my other videos so I will not bring it	626.339	3.601
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	up again but I hope you got the picture	628.14	3.48
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that this is what leads to more	629.94	4.019
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	inflation and as a result people look	631.62	4.26
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	for assets that are fixed in Supply	633.959	4.081
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Assets Now chemistry tells us and	635.88	4.38
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	history tells us total new gold that is	638.04	3.9
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	getting added to the supply you can't	640.26	3.54
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	escalate that by more than two to three	641.94	3.839
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	percent because that is the rate at	643.8	3.539
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	which the gold can be excavated	645.779	4.381
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	processed refined so it becomes somewhat	647.339	5.041
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	of a limited Supply asset and whenever	650.16	3.9
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	there is more money supply in the world	652.38	4.199
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	the price of the gold Rises now this has	654.06	4.8
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	happened in 2008 and therefore I showed	656.579	3.961
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you the graph I'll point it to you again	658.86	3.84
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that that was a time when gold prices	660.54	5.22
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	spied it again spied after 2020 quite	662.7	5.16
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	aggressively why because these were very	665.76	4.079
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	important quantitative easing or money	667.86	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	printing phases in the world now third	669.839	4.201
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	and more interestingly that many a times	671.94	4.86
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	there are countries that demand gold now	674.04	4.919
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	we might assume that the most of the	676.8	4.38
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	gold is sold to people who are craving	678.959	4.38
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	for jewelries that is not really the	681.18	4.8
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	case the biggest buyer of gold are	683.339	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	actually the governments now what has	685.98	4.38
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	happened after 2021 is that because of	687.839	5.041
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Russia Ukraine crisis the U.S imposed	690.36	4.8
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	sanctions on Russia they said that you	692.88	4.139
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	know what whatever money you have in USD	695.16	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you can't trade we are kicking you off	697.019	4.681
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	of our financial system Russia said cool	699.12	5.219
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	do it not a problem we will Peg our	701.7	4.62
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	currency to Gold they started buying a	704.339	3.601

ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	whatever I have spoken about are they	746.82	4.139

ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	which brings us to the third section of	770.639	3.541
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	the video where I will give you a very	772.139	3.961
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	quick overview of investing in gold	774.18	4.44
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	versus investing in equity so this will	776.1	4.62
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	help you further refine this topic and	778.62	4.2
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	accordingly build positions so many of	780.72	3.78
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you would be operating with the belief	782.82	3.12
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that buying something like Sovereign	784.5	3.779
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Gold Bond is a great investment option	785.94	4.32
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	right now why is that the case and in	788.279	3.24
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	case you don't know much about Sovereign	790.26	3.18
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Gold Bond I have done separate videos I	791.519	3.301
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	will link them in the description and	793.44	3.36
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	comment box but very quick understanding	794.82	3.959
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	is that there are two ways in which you	796.8	3.36
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	can buy gold in fact there are multiple	798.779	3.481
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	ways but two primary ways one is that	800.16	4.26
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you go and buy physical gold for example	802.26	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you buy gold coins you buy gold bars	804.42	4.02
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	then you go and stock them in your	806.76	4.199
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	locker or wherever it is second is that	808.44	4.98
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you buy gold in paper format paper	810.959	4.141
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	format right so what are these paper	813.42	3.78
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	format for example Sovereign Gold Bond	815.1	4.979
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	is a type of a bond that is issued by	817.2	4.74
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	the government so are you getting	820.079	3.901
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	physical access to Gold the answer is no	821.94	3.66
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	but the government tells you that you	823.98	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	know what trust us and buy these bonds	825.6	5.58
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	from us give us your 1000 rupee and in	828.06	5.339
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	theory or on paper you have like 1000	831.18	4.56
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	rupee worth of gold now the advantage	833.399	4.021
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	there is that the government says that	835.74	3.12
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	we will give you two to three percent	837.42	3.78
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	more market returns compared to whatever	838.86	5.159
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	the appreciation of gold is now if you	841.2	4.8
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	do a very quick comparison of sovereign	844.019	4.26
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Gold Bond what is happening there is	846.0	3.959
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that you are typically not making more	848.279	3.18
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	than nine to ten percent but these	849.959	3.481
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	returns definitely do depend on the	851.459	3.961
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	overall market returns on gold so to cut	853.44	3.66
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	the long story short what is happening	855.42	3.78
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	here is that whether you buy gold in	857.1	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	physical format or whether you buy gold	859.2	5.1
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	in paper format what is it that the gold	861.6	4.679
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	written is dependent on well it is	864.3	4.2
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	dependent on the underlying Return of	866.279	4.74
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	the gold as a commodity and we have	868.5	3.959
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	discussed this in the previous sections	871.019	3.301
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that if the overall gold prices go up	872.459	3.961
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	then probably sovereign gold one becomes	874.32	4.56
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	a wonderful investment but if the gold	876.42	4.919
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	price is in absolute terms are not going	878.88	4.86
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	up then whether you hold gold in a	881.339	4.8
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	physical format or in paper format you	883.74	4.44
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	will not make money or much money on	886.139	4.32
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	gold so this is part one of the equation	888.18	4.56
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	second part of the equation is that's it	890.459	3.961
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	if you have black money and if you are	892.74	3.959
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	buying gold bars gold coins Etc that is	894.42	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	okay because gold typically does not go	896.699	4.44
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	down in value on the flip side if you	898.92	3.84
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	are holding this black money then every	901.139	4.56
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	year the INR depreciates compared to US	902.76	5.1
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Dollar by four five percent so INR keeps	905.699	4.38
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	on losing its value so if you have black	907.86	3.479
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	money then you don't have too many	910.079	2.76
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	options I'm not promoting black money	911.339	3.24
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	economy I'm just simply discussing the	912.839	3.541
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	fundamental concept with that on the	914.579	3.481
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	flip side if you have white money right	916.38	3.72
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	with white money only you can go and buy	918.06	3.719
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	something like Sovereign Gold Bond now	920.1	3.12
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	comes the natural question that why	921.779	3.0
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	should you be buying sovereign gold one	923.22	3.419
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	now here if your answer is that's it	924.779	4.201
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	going forward in the future gold is	926.639	4.681
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	going to beat something like stocks in	928.98	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	terms of returns then you can go and	931.32	4.62
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	invest in gold I get a lot of counter	933.48	4.919
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	questions that okay should you not hedge	935.94	4.259
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	your portfolio by buying gold this that	938.399	3.601
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	no please understand the concept of	940.199	4.26
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	paper money here now whether you are	942.0	5.399
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	choosing to keep your money in hul stock	944.459	7.32
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	or nifty 50 or sgb I'm talking about sgb	947.399	6.12
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	not physical gold all these three	951.779	4.201
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	options are paper money options now very	953.519	4.081
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	quickly explaining you the concept of	955.98	3.359
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	paper money there are two types of	957.6	3.539
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	things in the world one is physical	959.339	3.541
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Goods if you are buying physical gold if	961.139	3.361
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you are buying physical real estate if	962.88	3.42
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you're buying real Commodities these are	964.5	3.42
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	physical Goods on the flip side	966.3	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	everything else is like paper money if	967.92	3.599
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	you are investing in the stock market	970.26	3.3
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	it's paper money if you are investing in	971.519	4.68
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	sgb It's Paper Money interestingly	973.56	4.98
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Sovereign Gold Bond are not bagged by	976.199	4.38
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	gold it's not like as if government is	978.54	4.08
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	keeping one kilo of gold in their locker	980.579	3.901
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	and issuing those one kilow worth of	982.62	3.959
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	bonds no they are not doing that in case	984.48	4.74
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	the government defaults your sgb goes	986.579	4.26
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	down with it and that is the difference	989.22	3.72
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	between paper assets and physical assets	990.839	4.081
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that physical assets do not need	992.94	4.019
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	government backing if you have a land	994.92	4.02
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	and if you hold it then that's a real	996.959	3.901
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	asset that you are owning but on the	998.94	4.44
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	flip side if you are owning nifty 50 and	1000.86	4.979
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	if the Indian government decides to	1003.38	4.68
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	devalue its currency then what would	1005.839	4.261
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	happen that if they decide that sore Peg	1008.06	3.779
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	of Earth will become like 50 rupees of	1010.1	3.84
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	worth after a few years how this will	1011.839	3.36
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	happen this will happen if the	1013.94	2.639
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	government decides to print a lot of	1015.199	3.121
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	money what happens to your nifty 50	1016.579	3.361
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	investment or any kind of paper	1018.32	3.42
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	Investments well it goes down in value	1019.94	4.32
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	by 50 does that happen to land that you	1021.74	4.26
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	own the short answer is no does that	1024.26	3.12
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	happen to physical gold that you're	1026.0	3.54
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	owning the short answer is no in my	1027.38	4.02
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	opinion rather than owning a sovereign	1029.54	3.539
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	gold one you are much better off	1031.4	4.62
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	investing in something like Nifty 50.	1033.079	5.22
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	why is that the case because nifty 50 is	1036.02	4.98
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	also a representation of paper money we	1038.299	4.801
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	have seen from the previous charts that	1041.0	3.9
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	the Returns on equities are much much	1043.1	3.18
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	higher from a long-term perspective	1044.9	3.84
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	compared to Gold returns and even if you	1046.28	3.96
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	add up that two to three percent return	1048.74	4.86

ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	going forward in the future now why is	1057.86	4.14
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that the case because nifty 50 is a	1059.78	4.68
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	barometer for our economy whenever we	1062.0	4.86
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	say that India's GDP is going up or	1064.46	3.959
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	India will become 10 trillion dollar	1066.86	3.9
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	economy what does that mean it means	1068.419	4.081
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	that the company is collectively in	1070.76	3.6
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	India or individuals collectively in	1072.5	3.72
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	India are generating that level of	1074.36	4.38
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	output it cannot happen that Nifty will	1076.22	4.26
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	stay at eighteen thousand nineteen	1078.74	3.059
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	thousand and India will become a ten	1080.48	2.939

ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	dollar then nifty 50 will at least do an	1090.02	4.68
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	equal amount of growth so to cut the	1092.96	3.839
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	long story short if you want to bet on	1094.7	3.839
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	the government and on that paper money	1096.799	4.5
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	then probably the best Matrix is to go	1098.539	5.041

ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	able to see the answer now comes the	1165.14	3.539
ZOKTyImkeiA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKTyImkeiA	final interesting point and there is a	1166.94	3.66

hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Hi, If we look closely at the Indian stock market, we will see the 2 biggest and most important players - FII and DII.	47.9	8.02
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	You must have often heard these names in the news or in YouTube videos.	56.12	3.13
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	FII stands for Foreign Institutional Investor.	59.35	2.58
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Big funds, hedge funds, pension funds, international insurance companies, and mutual funds outside India are FII investments.	62.0	11.52
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	So, India's Mutual Funds, Local Pension Schemes, Indian Insurance Co., and Banks or Financial Institutions are DII i.e. Domestic Institutional Investors.	73.72	11.18
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Now no one can command the market, but these two players are such that their actions will definitely have an impact on the market.	85.1	7.17
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Their buying can also show a boom in a crash market and their selling can also suppress a bull market under the claws of a bear.	92.47	7.11
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	And the last point is also correct. The scale and amount of capital that an institutional investor invests are huge.	99.78	7.31
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	So if these funds or institutional investors simultaneously withdraw money from the market or invest, it will impact the market.	107.29	9.53
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	If you follow the stock market a bit or watch our videos, you will know how FIIs did net selling in the Indian market in the last one and a half years.	117.28	10.71
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	FIIs did buy in some months, but overall they were sellers.	128.259	4.401
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Well, this buy-sell race will continue, but are you excited to know in which companies did FIIs hold the maximum?	133.18	9.11
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Well, I am very happy, and when our team came out with the top 3 companies with the highest FII holding in the September-ended quarter,	142.49	7.53
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	some very interesting names came out. And in today's video, I will tell you about these 3 stocks.	150.22	6.0
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	By the way, let us tell you that our team has considered only such companies whose market capitalization is more than 2000 crores.	156.42	7.12
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	In this video, we have considered the numbers of 20 January 2023. So let's start today's list.	163.74	5.98
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The first company is Zomato Ltd.	174.27	1.66
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Who does not know about Zomato?	175.98	2.06

hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	If we talk about Zomato's business, the company operates in B2B i.e, Business to Business, and B2C i.e, Business To Consumer segments.	188.05	9.31
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	How? Imagine, when you place an order on Zomato, the order is delivered to the restaurant owners through Zomato's app.	197.56	7.08
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	From there a delivery partner based near is selected who collects and delivers the order to your doorstep when the order is ready.	204.84	8.32
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	You can track all these things live,	213.36	3.03
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	your order is placed, your order is getting ready now, and the delivery partner has picked up the order, and delivered it. right?	216.54	6.75
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Now if seen, in this online food ordering and delivery model, you have an advantage as well as the restaurant.	223.65	6.31
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The restaurant saves a lot of costs, doesn't have to assign separate waiters, doesn't occupy tables, etc. And you get food in your comfort.	230.16	8.4
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	So basically, win-win for all parties, right? In return for this, Zomato is able to generate revenue on both fronts.	238.76	6.47
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Apart from this, the company also provides Consultancy Services and White Label Services.	245.43	4.69
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	White label service is if you want to make an independent food delivery app for your restaurant, then Zomato also provides you with this service.	250.32	10.24
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	After all, they have the complete structure ready, only a few changes have to be made.	260.76	4.26
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Besides food delivery, Zomato also operates in the hyperpure and dining-out segments.	265.41	5.16
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	On the growth front, the company's average customer transactions per month have grown by 116% to touch 14.7 million in FY22.	270.9	11.28

hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	You can also see good growth in the company's restaurant delivery partner and food delivery partners.	289.38	5.49
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	If we look at the revenue breakup of Zomato, food delivery was the core segment in FY22 which contributes 86% to the total revenue.	295.25	8.03
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The revenue of this segment was 65% in FY19, which has increased to 86%.	303.48	5.72
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	This is because Zomato's total revenue grew at 58% from FY19 to FY22, while the food delivery segment grew at 74% CAGR.	309.4	11.4
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	In addition, the hyperpure segment grew at a CAGR of 278%, while the dining-out segment declined.	321.14	6.8

hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Then after the lockdown, there was a huge jump in the users of both companies.	346.54	3.94
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	And now Zomato and Swiggy have almost the same number of users with them occupying the top 2 positions.	350.68	4.86
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The shareholding pattern, as of December 2022, FIIs hold 56.74% of the company as against 57.87% in the September-ended quarter.	355.89	10.94
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Recently Zomato acquired Blinkit.	367.03	3.01
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Blinkit is a quick commerce platform with a unique business model where your online orders are delivered within a narrow time window, usually 10 minutes.	370.24	11.27
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	We also recently discussed Quick Commerce and BlinkitPay in detail.	381.71	3.56
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Talking about Zomato's segment-wise Adjusted Ebitda margin, Zomato's Adjusted Ebitda in food delivery is -1.8%.	385.62	7.43
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Here, Zomato has adjusted EBITDA from share-based payment expense to calculate Adjusted EBITDA.	393.25	6.16
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Share-based payment spending refers to transactions where companies give up their equity in exchange for a product or service, or debt.	399.61	8.56
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Instead of going into the complexities, let us just understand that because currently Zomato is at negative Adjusted EBITDA,	408.37	6.61
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	it means that the company is making losses in its operations, and they are yet to move toward profitability.	415.05	7.38
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The same thing can be a risk for the investors of the company.	422.63	3.28
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The adjusted EBITDA of the Hyperpure segment is -22% and that of the Dining-Out segment is -0.2%.	426.3	5.74
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Let us look at some fundamental and technical ratios of Zomato.	432.4	3.63
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Since no competitor of Zomato is listed, we will not be able to compare its ratios.	436.23	4.94
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The second company on the list is Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited or HDFC Limited.	441.63	6.23
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	HDFC Limited is a pioneer in the housing finance space. It was incorporated in 1977 as India's first mortgage or home loan company.	448.07	9.87
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Today it is one of the largest financial conglomerates in India with a focus on many different domains of financial services apart from mortgage.	458.14	8.01
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	You must be aware of their subsidiaries in sectors like banking, insurance, and asset management company.	466.35	5.88
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	As you can see, HDFC Limited holds around 21% stake in HDFC Bank and close to 50% in HDFC Life, HDFC AMC, and HDFC ERGO.	472.63	11.52
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Also, HDFC Limited has a strong presence in venture capital, financial service delivery, and education lending through various subsidiaries	484.35	8.69
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	such as HDFC Credila, HDFC Capital, and HDFC Sales.	493.12	4.97
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The company's core business i.e. housing finance has approximately ₹69,03,000 crore of debt under management as on September 30, 2022.	498.48	13.809
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	6,903 billion, of which 81% went to individuals, and 19% combined to corporates, lease rental, and construction finance.	512.49	7.51
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	In Individual Loans, which is a major segment of the company, HDFC Ltd offers fixed and floating-rate home loans	520.2	7.15
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	as well as almost all types of home loans such as home improvement, home extension, and rural home loans.	527.55	6.96
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Going by the latest numbers, an interesting picture emerges.	534.71	3.75
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	In low-number terms, only 28% of the loans have been disbursed to the high-income group,	538.74	5.03
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	but in value terms, this group contributes 50% to the company's total individual loan book.	543.91	5.75
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	E though the middle-income and low-income groups are higher in number terms, their contribution in value terms is not proportionately higher.	549.86	7.95
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	With the diverse geographic distribution, the revenue distribution of HDFC Ltd. in personal loans, 79% is disbursed to the salaried class.	558.06	10.26
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	This somewhere else points to better risk management capability of the company.	568.52	4.32
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	One of the distinguishing features of HDFC Limited is its diversified and strong financial profile. And it's not just a limitation in distribution.	573.04	7.56
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	They also have well-diversified borrowing sources which give them the flexibility to raise capital.	580.8	5.51
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Whenever we talk about loans, we hear one word a lot, "Term loan" and to understand the business of home loans it is necessary to understand it.	586.51	9.78
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Now whenever you take a home loan, do you pay in one go after some time? No no.	596.49	5.73
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Whenever you take a home loan, you use it for a fixed tenure, making payments on a monthly basis.	602.42	5.28
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	This period, till the end of which you repay the loan in full, is used as “Term Length” and this loan is called Term Loan.	607.9	7.82
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	And the third part of this is the business revolver of HDFC Limited.	615.92	4.06
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The company also borrows from other financial institutions in the form of term loans and then lends to people in the form of term loans.	620.18	7.73
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The borrowings of the company are mainly in the form of debentures, fixed deposits, or term loans from the market.	628.25	5.29
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	This tells us that the company has strong resource-raising capabilities which differentiate them from the rest of the housing finance companies.	633.74	7.54
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	As of September 2022, HDFC Ltd's total capital adequacy ratio on a standalone basis stands at 22.5% against the required 15%.	641.55	9.18
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The capital adequacy ratio measures how well depositors' capital is protected and reflects the stability and efficiency of a bank or financial co.	650.93	9.07
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The company also has a strong earnings profile as reflected in its high Net Interest Margin, Return on Average Assets (RoAA), and Tier-I capital.	660.2	7.9
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Comparing HDFC Ltd. with its peers like LIC Housing Finance Ltd. on the basis of key metrics such as Return on Average Assets & Capital Adequacy Ratio,	668.3	10.36
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	we find that HDFC Ltd. is comfortably leading in both metrics.	678.95	5.04
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Return on Average Assets (RoAA) tells us how well any bank or financial firm utilizes its assets to generate profit.	684.31	7.81
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	To calculate this ratio, we divide the net income of the financial firm by the average total assets.	692.31	6.45
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The Tier-I capital ratio measures a bank's core equity capital against total risk-weighted assets.	699.17	6.26
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	This ratio is a major indicator of the financial strength of the bank or financial firm.	705.63	4.73
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	And risk-weighted assets mean that all its assets are weighted by the financial firm according to their credit risk.	710.6	6.57
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	It helps banks to determine the minimum amount of capital they need to hold to reduce the risk of insolvency.	717.37	8.1
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The immediate term risk for HDFC Ltd is compression in the net interest margin over the coming quarters due to rising interest rates.	726.04	8.79
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The net interest margin is the difference between income generated from the interest of a bank or financial institution and the interest paid on their borrowings or deposits.	735.03	11.16
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	RBI has recently increased interest rates by 35 basis points due to which the company's cost of borrowing has increased immediately	746.49	7.51
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	but customers may take some time to absorb this cost in the context of increased interest rates.	754.2	6.09
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Due to this, there can be a slight impact on their profitability.	760.49	3.37
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	However, the company has started passing on the interest rate hike to customers which may reflect in the company's margin expansion in the coming quarters.	764.24	9.31
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	HDFC Ltd. is facing intense competition in the retail mortgage loan segment, especially for big-ticket loans, especially from banks.	773.75	7.33
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	As of FY21, banks had a 60% share in the housing finance market.	781.28	5.4
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	That is why in April 2022, Mr. Deepak Parekh, Chairman of HDFC Limited, also announced the merger of HDFC Ltd with HDFC Bank.	786.88	8.43
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	And this step can help the joint entity to maintain an edge over its competitors.	795.51	5.37
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Factors like access to low-cost funds, wide distribution network, operational efficiency, and cross-selling can act as strong synergies for them	801.12	9.25
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	But the merger may take more time to complete as many regulatory hurdles will have to be cleared,	810.57	6.98
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	which could prove to be an overhang for the re-rating of the company.	817.75	3.36
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	If this merger is completed, then after the merger HDFC Bank will become one of the 7 largest banks in the world in terms of market cap.	821.55	8.91
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Furthermore, as of FY22, mortgage penetration in India stood at 13 percent of GDP.	830.58	5.69
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	But there are expectations that India will double its home loan disbursement by 2027.	836.47	5.37
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	So while the rest of the Asian economies have mortgage-to-GDP ratios in the range of 20-30%,	842.04	5.38
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	we can imagine that Indian housing finance companies have a long runway in this sector.	847.62	5.89
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	And this can benefit HDFC Bank plus the merged entity of HDFC Limited.	853.71	5.04
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	HDFC Limited is run as a professionally managed company where foreign investors hold 67.22%, and domestic institutions hold 21.57%.	859.18	10.89
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	FII holding stood at 67.77% in the quarter that ended in September.	870.27	4.38
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The FII stake in the merged entity stands at some 61%, according to calculations by Nuwama Alternative and Quantitative Research.	875.12	8.06
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	As you can see on your screen, we have shown some of the key financial and technical indicators of this company.	883.52	5.72
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	This comparison tells us that in the Debt to Equity metric, which is generally on the higher side for housing finance companies,	889.54	6.32
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	HDFC Ltd. is in a much healthier position compared to its peers in that metric.	895.97	4.61
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Along with this the 5 Year Sales CAGR is also 17.4%, which is very good against its peers.	900.9	6.19
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	HDFC Ltd.'s Return on Assets and Net Interest Margin ratio as of Sep 2022 is also better than its peers,	907.29	6.45
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	and these factors could be the reason for the high valuation of HDFC Ltd.	913.94	3.79
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The last company is One 97 Communications Limited.	918.18	3.04
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Yes, Paytm's parent company One97 Communications! Do you know Paytm is actually an acronym?	921.42	6.98
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	If yes then pause the video now and tell its full form in the comment. (Full form: "Pay through mobile").	928.6	5.84
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	One97 Communications provides digital payments and financial services through its platform Paytm.	934.64	6.14
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The company was started by Vijay Shekhar Sharma in 2010 from Noida, and today the name of the company would be known to every child.	941.12	6.44
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Because everyone must have heard at least one time today at some shop or even at a petrol pump.	947.76	5.43
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The company today provides payment services through mobile applications.	958.0	3.5
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Through this, a consumer can make his payment and a merchant can collect and pay his receivables online.	961.7	5.61
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Also, the company also provides Paytm Postpaid, Personal Loans, and Merchant Loans in association with financial institutions.	967.51	7.16
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Through Paytm Postpaid, the company offers small or micro-sized personal and merchant loans from various lenders.	975.1	6.54
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Providing and collecting these small loans digitally has become quite easy.	982.08	4.52
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	In fact, when these loans are granted, the company usually makes 2.5% to 3.5% of the loan amount upfront.	986.67	7.49
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Apart from this, it generates revenue in the same way even after repaying the debt of the company.	994.36	5.16
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Apart from this, the company also tries to fully monetize the traffic of the customers coming to its app.	999.72	4.89
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	One97 generates revenue by providing marketing services to other companies.	1004.93	4.75
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Also, the company also earns money by giving tickets, gift vouchers, deals, etc. to co-branded cards and other merchants.	1009.88	6.39
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Analyzing UPI payments, the company today covers a good market share in this segment despite the entry of giants like WhatsApp and Amazon.	1016.56	10.08
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	When new players such as WhatsApp and Amazon Pay entered the market, expected that they would be able to scale up quickly in this segment	1026.839	7.52
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	due to their existing wide user database,	1034.56	3.12
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	but by Dec 2022, Amazon Pay's market share will be 0.8 % and WhatsApp had only 0.1% of Pay, while Paytm's market share is around 15%.	1037.88	8.85
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	But despite having the advantage of an early mover, the company faces stiff competition from PhonePe and GooglePay.	1047.089	6.481
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Yes, GPay and PhonePe enjoy around 80% market share if UPI transactions are considered. And this is becoming a challenge for it.	1053.77	10.11
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Also, increasing digital infrastructure and cheap internet data can give healthy growth to this company and to this entire industry in the future.	1064.08	8.0
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The company has even said that it can acquire 100 million merchant entities and more than 500 million paying customers.	1072.46	6.89
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Apart from this, FASTag and co-branded credit cards have been successful products for the company.	1079.55	4.72
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The company is also exploring other avenues such as EMI aggregation and remittance.	1084.47	5.84
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	But one challenging thing for it is that despite strong growth prospects and a healthy market share, it has not been able to show profitability.	1090.51	7.98
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Although if you see, the company's margins are improving, their losses are still around 2020 levels.	1098.83	6.55
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Now just think about one thing, despite being such a loss-making company, FII has increased its stake in this company! Nothing seems odd.	1105.86	7.84
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	In fact, investing in such new-age companies is done by looking at their future growth rather than their current profitability.	1113.9	6.74
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	But you need to know that only growth is not necessary for wealth creation, it is equally important to have strong cash flow along with it.	1120.74	8.91
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	As you can see, from the day of listing till today Paytm is trading at less than half of its share price, let alone wealth creation for investors.	1130.16	8.84
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The reason for this was not only the loss of the company but also the high valuation of the listing of the company.	1139.2	5.74
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Also, the company may also face some difficulties in the coming times such as the initiative of an account aggregator by RBI.	1145.14	7.75
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	An account aggregator collects all the financial data of a particular person with their consent,	1152.98	5.13
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	such as bank details, loan details, investment, etc, and then provides it to the bank or NBFC.	1158.31	7.49
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Paytm is providing financial services to merchants and their consumers, providing lending services, their biggest asset is their data!	1166.0	9.76
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Yes, today the data of all merchants and individual users across India is nothing less than a valuable asset in the world of data-driven decision-making.	1175.96	9.52
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	But the RBI's account aggregator initiative may reduce the value of this asset significantly,	1185.68	5.44
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	as through this, the data that was only with Paytm will probably be easily accessible to all the necessary institutions.	1191.32	7.46
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	In the data analysis for the September 2022 quarter, FIIs hold a significant 77.26% in PayTM.	1198.98	7.04
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	That is, FIIs hold majority ownership in Paytm.	1206.22	3.2
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	And when we talk about shareholding, the management of Paytm recently announced the buyback of its shares from the public market.	1209.62	7.22
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	The idea was to reduce its share in the market and artificially increase the earnings per share.	1217.19	6.75
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	And then if the market uses it positively, then its share price will also increase. But obviously, the market is supreme – all are the public.	1224.07	7.2
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Until the company becomes profitable, the journey for the shareholders of Paytm to re-launch the IPO may be long and challenging.	1231.47	9.36
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	Now let us look at some of the financial ratios of the company.	1241.3	2.85
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	And since then, it's only one company in the listed space, so we won't be able to do peer comparisons.	1244.26	5.51
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	So what do you think, can we see a re-rating of HDFC Bank post-HDFC Twins merger?	1250.05	6.08
hTI5wNF6QMc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI5wNF6QMc	And will Paytm and Zomato be able to reward their shareholders? Definitely tell in the comments.	1256.33	4.98

wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	These questions keep coming to the minds of all those who invest in the stock market:	6.172	5.756
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	what is the market like today, Is it cheap? Should I invest today or wait for the right time?	11.928	7.299
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	On which stock should I invest apparently?	19.227	3.17
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	How should I benefit from the fluctuation in the stock market?	22.397	5.756
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	I guarantee that this video will be the answer to all these questions.	28.153	5.797
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So I request that you all save this video in your playlist,	33.95	5.13
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	as whenever, in a day, a year, or a decade, you ever get confused about what has to be done in the stock market,	39.08	8.05
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	this video would probably be able to answer all the possible questions, even after 5 decades.	47.13	6.59
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In the previous video, we discussed why we believe it is almost certain that the US economy will experience a recession or slow down,	53.72	10.427
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which will have an impact on the Indian economy.	64.147	5.422
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So when any such negative, or sometimes even positive, news is in the air, how should we think? How should we invest?	69.569	10.511
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	We’ll be learning everything in this video. To understand that, we'll look at a few quotes from Warren Buffett,	80.08	11.511
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	To invest, the world's lesson no. 1 is , and without realising it,
you can never create more wealth.	91.591	7.382
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And most of you have already learned Lesson No. 1. But, for some reason that I don't understand and you don't believe,	98.973	6.632
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Lesson No. 1 is that no one knows where the stock market will be the next day, in the next month, or in the next year.	105.605	14.473
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Although it differs in that many social media influencers can easily claim to have a study that will allow them to predict where the market will be tomorrow,	120.078	11.386
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and this prediction for tomorrow, which is one day, is quite long term,	131.464	3.587
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	many people can predict where the market will be in the next hour.	135.051	5.631
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Forget that; you also listen to influencers, news readers and investors with a hope	140.682	8.508
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	that you will get to know where the market is going.	149.19	4.672
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So you should think of a question: When Warren Buffett said that nobody knows,	153.862	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then why do these people tell us every day where the market will go?	160.285	4.504
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The answer is simple: there has to be some news on the channel every day,	164.789	4.213
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and on social media, there has to be some new video uploaded every day.	169.002	4.045
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But when one day you will completely believe the fact that nobody can tell, then you’ll start following the first rule of the investing world:	173.047	11.303
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	in the stock market, only invest the money that you don’t want back in the next five years,	184.35	6.465
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	as in the short run the market is very uncertain.	190.815	3.921
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Now, why have I mentioned a duration of 5 years,	194.736	2.878
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	It’s because Warren Buffett has said this multiple times:	197.614	2.502
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	"I only buy anything from the stock market assuming that the market will shut down the next day and will only open after 5 years."	200.116	10.385
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So after reading about Warren Buffett, I understood two things pretty quickly.	210.501	4.88
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	To begin, there can be a storm of negative or positive news in the stock market at any time and from any location.	215.381	6.549
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Secondly, don’t stress about the ups and downs of the stock market, invest in great businesses, or stocks that can overcome the storm and rise.	221.93	11.553
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But I was always confused about how to find such stocks in the stock market that would not sink in the storm.	233.483	10.969
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So the investors who doesn’t know how to evaluate the companie	244.452	3.545
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and how to read Balance sheet, Income statement, Cash flow statement,	247.997	4.088
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Warran Buffet made the investors understand the same through his letters to shareholders.	252.085	7.465
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Warren Buffett said that "from 1900 until the end of 1999, America witnessed two world wars,	259.55	8.509
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In 1929 saw a great depression, In 1918 faced an epidemic due to covid like flu, High Oil prices, around 12 recessions.	268.059	10.636
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Besides all this, the two index in stock market of USA rose from 66 points in 1900 to 11497 points in 1999.	278.695	14.389
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If we try to understand it in the context of India,
if you have no knowledge of the investing world,	293.084	8.342
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	what should you buy in the stock market?How do I invest? You don’t need an extraordinary fund manager or portfolio management service;	301.426	9.509
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	you only have to invest in the Indian economy.	310.935	3.42
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And the most straightforward and correct way to invest in the Indian economy is	314.355	5.005
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	what I have been preaching to India for the past 12 years in both offline and online sessions:	319.36	6.632
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	invest in the Sensex, Nifty, or something similar for the long term.	325.992	6.298
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	for which you can buy index funds like Sensex, Nifty,	332.29	5.172
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and because of you people, we can create a revolution in our country.	337.462	4.129
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In 2010, when I started telling people to invest,	341.591	5.505
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	there was only one way to buy Nifty, which was through Nifty bees,	347.096	6.34
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and its assets under management were not even 1000 crores.	353.436	3.921
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Many people told me that index investing would never be popular in India.	357.357	5.171
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Mutual fund distributors and advisors will never sell index funds,	362.528	4.713
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and mutual fund houses will never promote them.	367.241	3.337
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	We kept working on it for 12 years.	370.578	2.461
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And today, there is hardly any mutual fund house in India that does not offer index funds.	373.039	6.298
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	From even less than 1000 to 2000 cr asset under management to more than 2.5 lakh crore is invested in index funds in India.	379.337	9.885
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Not only that, but we ran a long campaign in the BSF for around 2.5 lac jawans and officers under BSF DG KK Sharma Sir to invest in Index.	389.222	14.973
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And we continue to spread knowledge in the Army, Air Force,
and many other organisations today.	404.195	7.132
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In addition, EPFO has decided to invest in Sensex and Nifty funds since 2015.	411.327	10.385
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And today, in Sec 80 C tax saving fund, that is ELSS, has also started launching the Nifty Index Fund.	421.712	7.883
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Those who’ve started walking along with me on the path of the index fund,	429.595	3.546
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	please drop a yes in the comment section so that we can popularise it in India.	433.141	9.676
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	For those who haven't grasped the concept of investing,	442.817	4.463
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	I'll summarise it in one minute and then we'll move on.	447.28	4.796
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So when you buy Nifty funds, you indirectly invest in the top 50 companies in Nifty.	452.076	7.633
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Companies with poor performance will have their weightage in the Index reduced.	459.709	5.338
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And if its performance gets worse, it drops out of the index.	465.047	4.672
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Companies that are not included in the index will be added if they perform well.	469.719	8.592
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	You don’t have to think of anything. You don’t have to change anything in the portfolio.	478.311	5.964
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	For those who believe that historical data is very important,	484.275	3.42
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	I want to tell them that in 1979,  Sensex,Whose base value was set to 100 has today reached to 60,000 after 42-43 years, which is an increase by 600 times.	487.695	13.972
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And this 600 times increment is the birth right of every Indian.	501.667	7.049
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In these 42-43 years, India faced a lot of problems	508.716	4.129
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	like Economic crisis in 1991, Harshad Mehta scam, Kargil War, Demonetization, US Housing crisis, Indian Banking Crisis, Covid Lockdown, everything.	512.845	11.845
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But it reached from hundred to sixty thousand.	524.69	3.963
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	As a result, many people are sceptical that investing in the index should be done blindly.	528.653	8.925
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	This is a complete misinterpretation of Warren Buffett’s teachings.	537.578	3.796
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Let me take those who understand the fundamentals of index investing to Warren Buffett's Lesson No. 2	541.374	8.091
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	so they can understand when the market is cheap or expensive.	549.465	4.838
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The lesson no. 2 is hidden in Warren Buffett Sir’s quote,	554.303	4.546
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	he says, "I will tell you how to become rich in the stock market." Be fearful when others are greedy. "Be greedy when others are fearful."	558.849	10.094
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Over here, he claims that when markets rise exponentially and the economy's future appears bright, many people make a lot of money.	568.943	9.76
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Then people become very greedy after seeing the past performance of the stock market and start investing a lot of money.	578.703	8.258
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The market becomes very expensive, so you've got to be fearful before investing.	586.961	7.799
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And when the economy is facing a huge blunder, everybody believes that the future is uncertain or very poor, then nobody invests.	594.76	8.843
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	You should invest aggressively if there is fear in the market and the market falls.	603.603	6.256
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The biggest problem with this quote is figuring out when the market is fearful, and when it is greedy, which means when it is cheap or expensive.	609.859	10.385
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So in the last few decades, I’ve made many ways for myself to find it out.	620.244	6.09
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And in March 2020, Nifty was at 8000. There was a lot of fear in the market, so I tried to teach a few ways out of it in this video	626.334	9.259
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and tell it was time to put everything on the market.Since then, the market has grown by more than 100% in three years.	635.593	9.176
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Remember that we can’t even tell how much more the market will fall, when it will rise, which means we can’t tell the time.	644.769	7.966
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But we could, and we were telling you that the market has become cheap,	652.735	5.172
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and because we can't tell the time, we took a 5-year horizon,	657.907	5.63
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	so watch this video; even now, you'll learn a lot from it.	663.537	5.714
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If I have to teach an investor who knows nothing about market timing how to use the MCAP to GDP ratio,	669.251	13.472
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	I generally suggest they use it because Warren Buffett Sir has talked about it a lot,	682.723	3.963
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and those who've seen my 4 hour free awareness programme must've heard of it.	686.686	7.257
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Market cap means the market value of all the stocks listed in the stock market,	693.943	4.713
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means the value of the complete stock market, and GDP means the final value of all goods and services produced in the country,	698.656	8.05
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which in turn means the amount of goods produced
by all the companies and people combined.	706.706	6.381
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So first try to understand why all of us, the followers of Warren Buffett, believe that the stock market increases as much as the GDP in the long term.	713.087	9.217
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The increase in GDP means that the companies are producing more.	722.304	3.838
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If the companies are producing more, it means they are selling more. If they are selling more, they will make more profit in long term.	726.142	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If the profit increases, the stock price will also increase in the long term.	732.565	4.129
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Furthermore, as GDP rises, so will market capitalization,
as measured by stock market value.	736.694	6.798
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And according to me, in normal circumstances, the ratio of market cap to GDP in the Indian context is around 1.	743.492	11.303
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Sometimes stock prices increase a lot as people find the future quite positive.	754.795	6.382
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Then the stock market value exceeds the value of the GDP.	761.177	4.296
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And this ratio increases to 1.4–1.5 or even more.	765.473	5.088
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Then you need to understand that the market has become expensive;
it has exceeded the GDP.	770.561	6.215
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Thus, it either has to fall or wait until the GDP value increases.	776.776	5.714
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And sometimes, because of market fear, it falls to such an extent that the ratio becomes 0.5,	782.49	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means the stock market value becomes much less than the GDP.	788.913	4.504
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Then you might say that the market has become cheap.	793.417	4.213
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	On March 24, 2020, when we made this video and stated that it was time to put all of the energy into the market,	797.63	7.799
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	among other things, I stated that the MCAP to GDP ratio had reached 0.5.	805.429	7.841
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Now, what is the ratio of MCAP to GDP and what has to be done accordingly, We’ll be discussing that by the end of the video.	813.27	7.508
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	However, if you believe it is very confusing or difficult to implement, Warren Buffett Sir makes investing easier	820.778	8.842
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	because knowing all of this and putting it into action are two different things.	829.62	5.714
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	When the economy is in bad shape and there is a lot of bad news,
it is difficult to put all of your efforts into it.	835.334	8.926
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And for the amount of emotional control and behavioural change that is required,	844.26	4.296
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	one has to listen to Warren Buffett’s teaching for years.	848.556	5.797
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Thus, Warren Buffett can make even the most inexperienced investor understand how to invest in a single sentence.	854.353	9.927
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	He claims that a novice investor can outperform (do better than) most investment professionals by investing in index funds on a regular basis.	864.28	10.719
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	By "periodic investment," he means to say that you invest through a SIP,	874.999	5.547
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means you fix an amount for each month and keep investing.	880.546	4.671
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	so that you don’t make the mistake of investing at the top of a one time market.	885.217	5.714
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And if you keep investing every month for a long time,
sometimes on top and sometimes on bottom,	890.931	6.507
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then your buying price will be the average of the high prices and the low prices.	897.438	6.298
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And if you buy Nifty at an average price, nobody can stop you from earning the market return, which is every Indian’s birth right.	903.736	12.554
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Warren Buffett also tells you where to do SIP: in index funds,	916.29	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	the Nifty 50 index, or the Nifty 500	922.713	6.965
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In the Nifty 500 Instead of the top 50 companies, the top 500 companies are included .	929.678	5.714
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	However, there are few options in India for investing in the Nifty 500,	935.392	6.048
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	but there will be many in the next 1-2 years.	941.44	4.087
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	He also claims that if you invest in an index fund like the Nifty 50 through a systematic investment plan (SIP),	945.527	7.466
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	your return will be above average;
in fact, you will outperform many investment professionals.	952.993	8.884
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And I am sharing that data with you all.	961.877	4.088
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So if you go to any website like Value Search to check the performance of India’s oldest fund to invest in Nifty, which is Niftybees,	965.965	9.676
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	remember that Niftybees just replicates the performance of the Nifty 50 index.	975.641	7.382
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So here we see, how the performance of Niftybees compares to the remaining large cap, which means the mutual funds that come in that category.	983.023	11.929
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In the last one year, this category had 124 funds, and if you had bought Nifty,	994.952	6.59
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	your rank in the funds would have been 32nd,	1001.542	3.253
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means you would’ve left 92 well educated fund managers behind.	1004.795	4.713
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In Percentage, you would’ve done better than 74% funds.	1009.508	4.004
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And if in the last 3 years you held Nifty, 
then your rank would have been 16th out of 102 funds,	1013.512	6.673
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means you would’ve left behind nearly 86 funds.	1020.185	3.838
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	It would have ranked 12th in 83 funds after 5 years. And in 10 years,
in 56 funds, its rank would’ve been 16th.	1024.023	8.341
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And keep in mind that in ten years, some funds will have closed
due to poor performance or will have merged with others.	1032.364	9.218
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Your rank will still be 16th in the remaining 56 funds, which are worth the business.	1041.582	6.548
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Think about how simple it is to beat such large fund managers,	1048.13	5.005
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	but we are still incapable of accomplishing such a simple task.	1053.135	4.129
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Warren Buffett sir teaches the same thing in his quote.	1057.264	3.587
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	He says, "There is an idiotic human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult."	1060.851	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Let’s understand how we make easy things so difficult.	1067.274	4.671
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	You say that after 10 years, Nifty has the 16th rank, which is good,	1071.945	4.255
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	but let's find out what the first 15 funds are.	1076.2	2.919
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Many people analyse the market by looking at past performance to look for the best funds.	1079.119	5.923
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Although it's mentioned in the fund documents as well that past performance does not guarantee future performance.	1085.042	5.881
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Then also you buy those best funds.	1090.923	2.586
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And you must have noticed it many times that these funds were waiting for you	1093.509	5.589
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	as when you buy, its performance drops.	1099.098	4.295
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And when you try to switch to some other funds,	1103.393	4.422
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	if you make a profit, you'll have to pay taxes on it as well,
known as the long-term capital gain tax.	1107.815	9.592
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	someday, any of your friends, agents, or advisors might tell you,	1117.407	6.424
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	"Look, my funds or my stocks are performing so well in the Nifty;	1123.831	3.378
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	why are you stuck in the Index?" And looking at their higher return,
you’ll not be able to tolerate the pain in your chest.	1127.209	7.799
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And the explanation of this pain is mentioned in the holy book of Warren Buffett.	1135.008	4.839
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	He says that when any of your friends' IQs are 20–30 points
lower than yours and they earn more than you,	1139.847	7.59
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then no pain is bigger than the pain you feel.	1147.437	5.464
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Just remember that investing is not a 100-meter race where you keep 
noticing who is behind us or ahead of us.	1152.901	8.884
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	It’s more like a marathon, where if you keep moving forward using the right investment strategy,	1161.785	5.798
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	you might find people lying on the track who were once ahead of you.	1167.583	5.839
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If someone tells you that their return is more than their return,	1173.422	4.88
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	to control your pain,
please show them this article from Forbes titled	1178.302	4.337
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Any monkey can beat the markets,	1182.639	2.962
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	please show them this article from Forbes According to this article, in 1973,	1185.601	4.254
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Princeton University professor Burton Malkiel wrote in his book that even if a monkey with its eyes closed selects stocks from a financial newspaper,	1189.855	13.805
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	the performance of those stocks will be equal to that of experts.	1203.66	3.045
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	People said this is a lie, then an experiment happened
and monkeys were asked to make portfolios.	1206.705	8.217
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	When the results came in, people found that Malkeil was wrong,	1214.922	4.587
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	the performance of stocks chosen by monkeys beat the
performance of stocks chosen by experts.	1219.509	6.59
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Now, will you give money to those monkeys to manage?	1226.099	4.713
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In the same way, if anyone beats the index today,
there are so many funds, one of them will beat it.	1230.812	7.216
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	In the long run, finding out the same thing is simple;	1238.028	3.67
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	saying that today is as difficult as predicting which monkey will beat the expert.	1241.698	9.593
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So many of you will say that, okay, it's clear that, in the form of a SIP,
you need to invest every month in an Nifty index fund.	1251.291	9.176
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But we should start the SIP only when the market value drops.	1260.467	5.214
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So whenever any such thought hits your mind that
you’ll only start investing when the value drops,	1265.681	6.464
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	remember the quote by Peter Lynch in which he said,	1272.145	3.838
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	"More money is lost in the anticipation of the fall than the fall itself,"	1275.983	5.088
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means that just because you keep waiting for the market to fall	1281.071	3.378
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and you don’t invest,	1284.449	1.377
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	you basically don’t even make the money that you could’ve
made by investing in the long term.	1285.826	7.174
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Remember that the investors who keep waiting for the right time are more at a 
loss than the long term investors due to the market's fall.	1293.0	11.011
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	As mostly when the market falls, it impacts so negatively that it's hard
to gather the courage to invest again.	1304.011	8.049
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And let me share a data explaining to why you should not really wait to invest in SIP.	1312.06	6.674
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The most controversial topic in the world of
investment is t	1318.734	5.338
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	That how much return does Nifty give.	1324.072	2.503
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	My first answer will be that it depends on from which date are you calculating	1326.575	5.213
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	as if you check the return from the bottom, you’ll find it more.	1331.788	5.005
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If you check the returns from the top, you’ll find it less.	1336.793	4.213
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Now why do we say that we assume 15% return in long term,	1341.006	4.671
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	I’ve given a detailed explanation in the video.	1345.677	3.17
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	As in India, the very first time when the method to invest in
Nifty was introduced in January’2002	1348.847	6.465
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	so let me bring the data from there itself.	1355.312	2.002
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	On 30th January 2002 the value of Nifty was 1067 and now after this
Adani news the value dropped to 17500.	1357.314	12.304
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	so if I calculate the annual return from last 21 years then it is 14.25%	1369.618	6.214
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	but it doesn’t give you the complete picture as the dividend that declares the companies under Nifty is not calculated in it.	1375.832	8.634
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So, to get the clear picture of it, it’s better to check the return of TRI Index,	1384.466	6.423
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	that is Total Return Index, in which the dividend is also added.	1390.889	5.255
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So, the value of Nifty TRI Index was 1159 on 30th Jan 2002	1396.144	6.882
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and now it is 25000 after 21 years.	1403.026	3.879
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Thus the actual return is 15.8% but remember whenever the market will fall,	1406.905	6.59
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then the return also does. And as when the market rises, the return also increases by 15%.	1413.495	5.881
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Now check the data to understand why it is not required to wait to start an SIP.	1419.376	5.464
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If you would’ve started an SIP 15 years back in Jan 2008 when the Nifty value was 6000,	1424.84	9.926
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	after which the market fell by more than 50%,	1434.766	2.795
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then your annual return of the SIP would’ve been 12.46% that we can see on the site of value research.	1437.561	7.757
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	And if you would’ve started an SIP in Jan 2009
when the market value dropped from 6000 to 3000,	1445.318	8.259
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then in 14 years, the return in SIP would be 12.58%,	1453.577	5.797
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means you start from the bottom or from the peak, it remains the same.	1459.374	5.547
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If you find it less then remember that Nifty return increases with GDP.	1464.921	6.298
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Since Covid, there was a negligible growth in GDP so even if the market grows in future,	1471.219	6.298
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	The market will correct itself in future.	1477.517	4.88
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	If you’re a know nothing investor and you want to get benefitted from the ups and downs of the market	1482.397	5.255
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	then you can focus on the ratio of Mcap and GDP.	1487.652	3.921
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Today  the ratio of Mcap/GDP in India is around 1,	1491.573	5.464
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	which means the market is neither cheap nor expensive and we can’t even predict if the market will be expensive first or cheap.	1497.037	8.717
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But if it gets cheaper then invest as much as possible,	1505.754	4.212
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	like we did in March’2020.	1509.966	3.254
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	But if I would have been at your place, I would’ve started an SIP in Nifty Index	1513.22	5.588
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and as the ratio of Mcap/GDP would become 0.5, then I would’ve increased the amount invested in SIP	1518.808	8.134
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	and you would’ve got the return even more than market return.	1526.942	5.171
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	So according to me, stop watching the stock market news on
TV and the views of social media influencers.	1532.113	8.05
wTpIK4VFBc4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTpIK4VFBc4	Either start reading Warren Buffett or start an SIP in Nifty Index fund.	1540.163	7.174
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Mamaearth is coming with its IPO	0.001	1.975
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and I am sure, a lot of
people are very excited!	2.001	2.816
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But the most important
thing for you is,	5.083	2.272
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	is this IPO an
opportunity for you,	7.442	2.667
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	or is this IPO a hoax for you?	10.223	2.056
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And I am sure, you must have
seen many videos related to it!	12.486	4.103
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But the things I am going
to tell you in this video,	16.865	2.682
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	no one has told you that,	19.684	1.69
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and I am going to explain
you that in a such a simple way,	21.464	2.96
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that if you don't
understand stock market,	24.571	2.724
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	you don't have that
much knowledge,	27.439	1.476
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	still you are going to know
everything about this IPO.	29.134	4.905
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So, let's move forward!	34.321	1.063
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	First of all, you see, why IPO?	35.766	3.385
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Technically, when any
company comes with IPO,	39.453	4.302
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	first of all, ask this question
if you are a beginner,	43.78	3.139
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	or you've been
investing in market,	47.192	2.461
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	still when any IPO comes,
your first job is to ask question,	50.061	5.957
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that why is that company
coming up with IPO?	56.209	2.421
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	What are the reasons?	58.72	0.825
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Because, whatever company it is	59.753	3.484
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	comes up with IPO because
of one of these three reasons.	63.431	3.888
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	First reason is,	67.59	3.19
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	company needs funds.	72.627	2.175
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Many a times, company doesn't
have money and it needs money!	77.139	4.421
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And they don't want
to go with loan options,	81.828	2.293
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they want to raise money through equity
so that they can keep company running.	84.146	4.946
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So first thing is that
company needs fund.	89.374	2.929
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Second reason behind IPO	92.719	2.008
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	is that company
wants to do expansion.	95.586	1.826
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	They need money to do expansion.	100.316	1.952
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	It need money for
expansion not survival.	102.293	4.495
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And the most important thing because of which
most of the start-ups are coming with IPO	107.273	5.974
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that is exit.	113.66	0.905
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Exit for whom?	117.188	1.016
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	For founders,	119.102	0.913
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and investors.	122.098	1.206
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So that they can also get
good exit, that's why IPOs come.	126.348	4.206
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And if see most of the IPOs, they
come wit IPO because of this reason.	130.579	3.805
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	They don't have any interest in expansion
because they have already expanded so much	134.604	3.738
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And now it is the time to give
good exit to their investors.	138.48	5.691
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Now let's move forward,	144.573	1.112
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and understand the
scenario of Mamaearth.	145.979	2.837
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If I breakdown IPO, the parent company
of Mamaearth is Hansa Consumer pvt. ltd.	149.278	6.426
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	In Hansa Consumer pvt. ltd.	156.426	2.127
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they submitted these
details in their IPO,	158.842	3.794
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	in which the fresh issue
is 400 crore rupees.	162.997	2.802
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	There is fresh
issue of 400 crore.	166.294	1.563
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And Offer for Sale which is
called as OFS, that is 2500 crore.	168.267	5.406
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So technically, they are coming with IPO of 2900 crores.	174.002	3.119
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	In which 2500 crore
rupees is for Offer for Sale.	177.384	4.327
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And this money is for fresh issue.	182.701	2.175
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	The money that is
raised through fresh issue,	185.171	2.096
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	investors or founders can't
take that money to their home.	187.292	5.221
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Okay?	192.894	0.594
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	They money that is being raised
through fresh issue i.e. 400 crores	193.744	3.849
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that would be
invested in company.	197.786	1.564
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But these 2500 crore rupees	201.483	4.254
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	this is on offer for sale.	205.762	2.476
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	That means, the stocks
that will dilute here	208.521	1.762
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	if investors or venture
capitalists want,	210.5	5.508
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they can take this
money to their home.	216.282	1.722
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And you can't do anything.	218.762	1.047
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So technically, no doubt
this IPO is for offer for sale	219.834	4.922
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	means offer for sale
comes in the form of IPO.	224.902	4.055
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But majority portion
is for offer for sale.	229.13	2.921
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Fresh issue is just 400 crores,	232.49	1.825
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	technically, the amount that would
be stay in company for its growth	234.492	4.516
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that is just 400 crores and
rest will go to their homes.	239.14	3.079
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Now you see forward.	242.676	1.0
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Let's understand business model.	244.528	1.428
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Hansa Consumer pvt. ltd. has a
lot of brands including Mamaearth	246.45	4.944
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	like 'The Derma Company',	251.638	1.04
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Aqualogica,	254.434	0.953
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Ayuga,	256.198	0.587
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	a lot of brands are there
which this company is running.	256.81	4.365
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Mamaearth is just one brand.	261.2	1.79
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But because it is popular,
that's why we are talking about it,	263.015	2.745
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	as of now.	265.93	0.667
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Let's move ahead and try to
understand the most important thing,	266.931	3.437
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	whenever you are
investing in any startup	270.714	4.421
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	or even any company
which is not a startup,	275.337	2.794
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	if you are investing in IPO	278.578	1.429
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	just get the answers of three
question I am going to give.	280.287	4.365
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You'll be able to do analysis in
these three questions very well.	284.968	4.936
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	First of all,	290.481	0.722
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	is the market share
of company is growing?	291.855	3.896
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	In Mamaearth's scenario,
its market share is growing.	298.48	3.833
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	It is definitely growing.	302.683	2.175
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So first see, if the market share
of company is growing or not.	305.176	3.601
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Second, the product in
which company is dealing	309.19	3.73
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	is that product a habit
forming product or not?	313.043	3.995
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And if it is,	317.373	1.746
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	then how much is the
dependency on that product?	319.391	3.412
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Let me give you an example.	323.951	1.611
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	There is a product
named Beera which is beer.	325.929	2.278
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Okay!	328.805	0.54
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	In this, dependency is very low,	329.559	2.239
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	but it is habit forming product.	332.165	2.325
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Once people get habituated,
they consume it repeatedly.	334.7	3.806
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	In mamaearth's scenario, are
the products habit forming or not?	338.935	5.582
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You have to answer this question!	344.871	3.32
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And last, how much
is the competition?	348.548	2.661
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Is the competition high or low?	351.234	2.777
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	In mamaearth's case, it
is a beauty care brand.	354.316	3.556
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And in beauty care brand,	358.472	1.611
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	competition is very high,
especially in this segment.	360.323	3.659
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	P&G, HUL are in this market.	364.351	3.437
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You cam imagine how
huge the competition is.	367.981	2.417
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So competing is tough.	370.423	1.459
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	They may or may not
be habit forming products.	372.266	2.524
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Because I've not used them.	374.815	2.217
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And last,	377.223	0.904
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	is the market share
is growing or not?	378.518	2.214
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	It is definitely growing.	380.757	1.104
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Now let me take you forward,	381.886	1.103
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and from there, actual
thing starts of the company.	383.277	2.557
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And this is its actual reality.	385.859	2.023
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Now you see.	388.203	0.738
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	What is the revenue
growth of company?	389.299	2.341
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Means, what growth did
company achieve in that period?	391.665	3.517
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So you can see, in
revenue growth scenario	395.416	2.199
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	revenue jumped
from 109 to 461 crores.	399.564	3.596
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You can see, all
figures are in crores.	403.185	2.582
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So revenue growth is 4x.	406.182	4.103
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Can you see?	411.601	0.571
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Revenue has grown 4x.	412.474	1.468
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Along-with it, you can see I've
highlighted operating revenue,	413.967	3.644
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and here, I've

kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Look at these expenses,	420.379	1.397
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	when company increased its revenue	421.801	2.318
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	how much its expenses increased?	424.463	1.801
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Expenses growth was 3.7x.	426.974	3.524
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Means, revenue has grown 4 times	430.645	2.492
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	but expenses have
also grown 4 times.	433.331	3.444
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Now, let's come to the next thing.	437.398	2.23
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	That is profit history.	440.091	1.421
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	See, profit growth is a different thing	441.855	2.095
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and profit history
is a different thing.	443.975	2.452
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Profit growth shows
the growth over time.	446.757	3.0
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	When you are studying history of
any startup, see the profit history.	450.349	4.698
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Profit history is important.	455.393	1.897
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Means, how many years has
that company been profitable?	457.53	2.81
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Have that company been
making profit for 2-3 years,	460.461	2.389
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	or has it started
making profit suddenly?	463.02	2.27
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Because the company which are showing
you that we became profitable instantly,	465.563	3.928
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	there, financial
engineering is done.	469.949	4.857
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And experts do this,	474.831	1.305
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	common people don't
understand this thing.	476.32	2.135
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If you read DRHP	478.48	1.421
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	you won't understand
these things easily.	480.077	2.265
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Reason being,	482.367	0.706
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	experts make it such a way
that people don't understand.	483.352	3.595
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	CAs understand this or those who
come from financial background,	487.189	3.365
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they understand it very
easily. Now you see...	490.636	2.318
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	if you see profit history,	493.648	1.444
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	I've highlighted
profit and loss.	495.261	2.269
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Look carefully!	497.715	0.842
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	There was loss earlier.	499.114	1.088
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Here it is 24.59, but
technically it is 14-22 crores.	500.719	6.574
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Sometimes you'll see 14
crores, sometimes 22 crores.	507.718	4.293
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	They are showing this range,	512.38	1.294
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	but if you see profit history	514.018	1.913
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	the company was in loss.	516.004	1.946
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Means, now the IPO is coming	518.063	2.19
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	company became profitable this year	520.565	2.375
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and before that, it was in loss.	522.965	2.785
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And why were losses there?	525.88	1.198
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	As its revenue was increasing, its expenses
were also increasing in the same manner!	527.302	4.349
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So, try to understand this thing,	532.069	2.399
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	which I am going
to tell you after that!	534.651	1.873
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	That is valuation.	536.653	1.032
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Currently, company	538.537	1.373
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	is claiming valuation
of 24k crore rupees.	541.158	3.127
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Figures are showing this amount online.	544.391	3.431
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	It is showing the valuation of
24k crore rupees i.e. $3 billions.	547.991	5.233
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	On the valuation of 24k crore
rupees, it is raising 2900 crore rupees.	553.672	4.571
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Technically,
amount is not that big	558.446	2.73
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	but you try to
understand the valuation!	561.201	2.303
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	The valuation on which
company is raising this money	563.746	2.659
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	is it right or an
over valued asset?	566.486	4.373
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Its actual answer is here!	573.535	4.888
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	In the profit history.	578.729	1.389
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	In revenue growth.	580.494	1.461
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Revenue is increasing but along-with
it, expenses are also increasing.	582.701	3.54
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And the company is not
particularly profitable!	586.443	2.222
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So the way they are claiming
their valuation, is very high.	589.184	4.566
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Why is that high?	594.126	1.302
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	To understand this, it is very important to
understand its operating model, market scenario,	595.671	7.048
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	which majority of the
people won't tell you!	602.744	2.468
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And if you understand this,	605.426	1.485
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	you'll understand, is it
okay to invest money or not.	607.192	3.73
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Keep watching.	611.234	0.794
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Problems in business model.	613.492	1.413
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If you have to invest
in any company,	614.93	3.166
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	just find problems
in its business model.	618.385	2.635
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And analyze that are these
problems big or normal.	621.532	6.956
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If those problems are very big,	628.705	1.423
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	then it will cause you loss
while investing in that company.	630.366	3.826
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Now let me explain you the
problems with Mamaearth!	634.386	3.31
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	See!	638.0	0.572
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Mamaearth is a D2C brand.	638.866	2.738
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	I.e. Direct to customers.	641.774	1.523
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Okay?	643.842	0.492
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And to market themselves, they
told that their products are safe.	644.547	5.904
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Okay?	651.262	0.547
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Agreed!	652.485	0.635
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	They run ads to market this,	653.377	4.976
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and,	659.214	0.476
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	gave money to influencers.	661.383	1.691
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You will see, many
influencers have done their ads.	663.592	2.738
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	There is a very interesting thing.	666.476	1.682
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Try to understand.	668.485	1.201
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	First understand,
what their segment is!	670.028	3.088
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Mamaearth operates
in premium segment.	674.191	3.015
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If you see the price range
of Mamaearth products	677.735	3.906
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	350 rupees	682.771	1.166
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	500 rupees	684.447	0.675
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	600 rupees	685.647	0.73
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	sometimes 250 rupees.	687.442	0.968
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	It comes in premium segment if you
compare it to other beauty care products,	688.85	3.992
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	or normal brands which are
available in the market like HUL, P&G.	692.867	4.473
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So technically they
operate in premium segment.	697.582	3.008
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But the problem over here is	701.125	2.396
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	by running ads and
giving money to influencers	703.801	2.722
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they acquired customers.	707.162	1.445
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Which is a good thing
but the interesting part is	711.397	2.247
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	the customers they
acquired were wrong.	713.916	3.071
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Let me tell you, how!
See!	717.277	1.396
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	When you are operating in premium
segment, you need premium customer.	719.239	4.404
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But because they
spent a lot on ads,	727.685	3.333
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and also paid the
influencers to promote it,	731.043	3.104
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and after that they
run heavy discounts,	734.382	3.325
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	its result was that it got
non premium customers.	738.275	6.867
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Because of discount.	748.779	1.381
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You think, if I give 30%
off on 250 rs. product	750.576	6.998
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	it automatically will
cost around 200 rupees.	758.551	2.691
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Right?	762.293	0.5
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	This is the game.	763.707	0.873
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	What they did,	765.098	1.214
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they acquired a lot of
customers by giving the discounts.	766.432	3.524
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Which is fine.	770.293	0.714
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Because they needed
premium customers,	771.183	2.532
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they got premium customers,	774.139	2.27
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	it's not that they didn't
get premium customers,	776.482	1.849
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	but they got non premium customers
more than premium customers.	778.652	4.206
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	I'll tell you the actual game
of non premium customers,	783.316	4.071
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	whenever you are
selling a premium product	787.859	2.595
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and you acquired non premium
customers, what problems you will face,	790.514	3.381
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	let me tell you now.	794.025	1.35
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But if analyze the
scenario very closely,	795.52	3.428
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	mamaearth, a premium brand has non premium
customers more than premium customers.	799.078	5.122
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Now, see the problem!	804.422	0.978
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Discount driver sales funnel.	806.552	1.985
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	This is the actual problem.	808.96	1.381
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	See.	810.962	0.437
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Non premium customers	812.09	1.984
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	why did they come to that brand?	816.849	3.024
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Not because the influencer
said that this product is good,	820.408	3.54
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they came because of heavy discounts.	825.167	1.921
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Now the problem over here is	829.88	2.254
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	if they have to keep it's existing
customer base maintained,	832.739	5.534
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	then it's must to rely
on discount for them!	838.674	3.746
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Suppose, the company
is giving discount,	842.711	2.412
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	then if the company
has to increase its profit,	845.332	2.873
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	then what's the method
to increase the profit?	848.613	3.257
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Either it will reduce discount,	852.077	1.976
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	right?	854.651	0.539
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Or it will increase its sales a lot.	855.373	2.063
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Even if they are increasing the sale	857.526	1.762
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	then because I showed
you the revenue chart	859.537	2.183
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	then their expenses are
increasing with sales increment,	861.945	3.222
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	so there would be
no profit from there.	865.504	1.405
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	What's the method
of making profit?	867.093	1.302
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	After a certain period of time, reduce
the discount for existing customers.	868.619	4.628
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But this is the problem!	873.513	1.063
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Brand has non premium customers!	874.798	2.826
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If you reduce the discount
for non premium customers	878.002	3.254
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	then brand will loose customers.	881.647	3.914
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Now what's the problem?
If they want to keep customers retained	888.646	3.743
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they have two options!	892.414	1.245
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	First is, either you keep
your discount stable.	894.343	5.876
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Keep giving discount.	901.487	1.619
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	This is the first option!	903.585	1.095
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	That you keep giving
heavy discount to people,	904.926	2.46
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	non premium customers
will stay with you!	907.453	2.421
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	That's okay, we
have given discount.	910.042	1.953
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Or in this scenario, profit
margin of company will decline.	912.475	4.706
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Correct?	917.742	0.5
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Or company will choose
other option and that is,	918.497	2.913
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	company will reduce its pricing.	921.643	2.524
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	It will reduce its
product pricing.	925.305	1.984
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Means, if the company is
selling the product at 350 rupees,	927.314	3.089
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	then they will reduce
it to 200 rupees.	930.635	2.222
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Or it is selling the
product at 500 rupees,	933.184	2.311
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	then they will reduce
it to 350 rupees.	935.924	1.072
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Be it anything.	937.363	0.881
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But they will reduce the pricing.	938.475	1.302
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	In both scenarios,
either it is price reduction	940.144	2.857
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	or they keep their discount stable,
i.e. keep giving discount as earlier.	943.473	3.884
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	In both scenarios,
there would be no profit.	947.811	4.558
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	There would be no profit margin.	952.563	2.69
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	This is the scenario.	956.184	0.984
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And most of the people
don't understand this thing.	957.576	2.531
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Understand the
customers of the company.	960.396	2.175
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Understand the
game of the company.	962.596	1.454
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You will come to know if there
is any scope of profitability or not.	964.075	4.921
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Because most of the
customers are non premium.	969.216	2.444
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	They came to the brand
because of discounts.	971.773	2.492
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If they stop giving discount,
they will lose customers.	974.29	1.867
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	See forward!	976.517	0.817
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Problems in financials.	978.678	1.532
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	This is also a big matter.	980.235	1.237
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Till now, I told you about
the problem with company,	981.91	4.22
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	problems in business
model, revenue and all.	986.155	3.166
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Now let me tell you, what's
the issue in financial statements.	989.833	3.73
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If you want to know in detail	993.86	1.77
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	I'll attach the link of
DRHP, you can read that.	995.655	3.074
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Read only specific
pages in DRHP,	999.065	2.998
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	you can't read whole,
as it has 400 pages.	1002.088	2.193
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	See forward!	1004.387	0.667
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Here the actual scenario is profit.	1005.435	3.012
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Technically, company's
profit is 22 crore rupees,	1009.345	3.96
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	whatever people are claiming.
I am assuming this.	1013.437	2.174
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But the profit history
is non existent.	1016.344	4.676
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Means, there is no profit history.	1021.644	1.738
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Company made profit
of 22 crores this year.	1023.788	2.683
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	It hardly made 22
crore rupees as profit,	1026.761	2.619
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	there is no history of profit.	1029.539	1.588
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	It may be possible that the
profit which is being shown	1031.152	3.86
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	has some financial
engineering involved.	1035.293	4.31
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Very high chances.	1042.022	1.19
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Because think, company which was in loss,
how did it became profitable suddenly?	1043.484	3.778
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	First point is this.	1047.353	0.817
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Second thing,	1048.466	1.071
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	if you see the assets of company,
read balance sheet carefully	1049.936	3.389
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	you will get in DRHP.	1053.558	1.508
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Company has intangible
assets worth 1700 crores.	1055.45	6.787
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Problems are not intangible
assets worth 1700 crores.	1068.725	2.77
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	The problem is that the
intangible assets company have,	1071.52	3.915
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	is the goodwill.	1076.478	1.0
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Getting it?	1078.696	0.841
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	This is not IPR.
Intangible assets include IPR also.	1081.43	4.166
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Intellectual Property Rights.	1085.621	1.613
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Which has very high value.	1087.316	2.159
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Because if you have IPR, you
have monopoly in something.	1089.62	3.04
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	No!	1092.966	0.682
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Company doesn't have IPR.	1094.124	1.556
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Trademark value of
company isn't that much.	1096.087	4.167
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	They have shown goodwill
in their intangible assets.	1100.585	4.666
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	They have shown goodwill
worth 1700 crore rupees.	1106.003	2.309
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Let me tell you what the
problem comes over here.	1108.337	1.795
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If you read the balance sheet
very carefully, you'll come to know	1110.491	2.754
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that the goodwill of 1700 crores
is being shown in intangible assets,	1113.527	4.841
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that's why that balance
sheet is looking fine.	1120.049	4.223
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But actually, the physical
assets company has	1124.65	4.388
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	are not that much!	1129.306	1.222
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	I am not saying that it doesn't have.	1130.553	1.316
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	It has but not that much,	1132.038	2.008
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that in case if company
faces any problem,	1134.406	2.675
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they sell their assets or take
any loan to save the company.	1137.106	7.352
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If you see	1145.021	1.254
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	a lot of people abuse Reliance
Communications of Anil Ambani,	1146.745	3.564
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	but the thing is if you read the balance
sheet of Reliance Communications	1150.414	3.135
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	you would have see that company
has a lot of physical assets,	1153.815	3.968
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and that is the reason, by
selling those physical assets	1157.979	3.555
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Anil Ambani is
fixing its bankruptcy.	1161.769	4.032
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Because they have
physical assets to give,	1166.01	2.079
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Reliance Jio has acquired
a lot of physical assets.	1168.275	4.564
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But here, they don't
have any physical assets.	1173.034	2.357
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You won't go to see
goodwill in the market.	1175.633	2.809
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Try to sell goodwill.	1178.62	1.254
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You can't sell.	1180.407	1.206
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Goodwill is such an intangible
asset, that is very tough to sell.	1181.75	3.772
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	How would you sell it?	1185.547	0.999
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You can't do!	1186.707	0.905
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And that is the thing,	1187.834	0.954
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	people don't analyze
things in detail.	1189.178	4.258
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You'll get all details in DRHP.
I'll put the link of DRHP below.	1193.532	3.945
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But the thing is, the
things that I've told you now	1197.639	3.285
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	are enough for a normal
person to understand	1201.54	5.073
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that whether you should you
invest in IPO of company or not.	1206.832	5.034
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	I've told you the problems
in business model,	1212.187	2.595
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	apart from that, what are the problems
in revenue, and the profit history	1215.016	3.786
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	I've told you all these things.	1218.827	1.953
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If you want to know
my personal opinion,	1220.983	2.095
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that you shouldn’t
invest in this company.	1223.366	2.857
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Reason being, balance sheet is not
strong and involves financial engineering.	1226.456	4.327
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Apart from this,	1230.946	0.967
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they have discount
driven sales funnel	1232.168	3.262
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	means they are able to
sell because of discounts.	1235.455	2.807
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And because they acquired non premium
customers instead of premium customers,	1238.664	5.997
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	they have customer base
of non premium customers.	1244.773	4.682
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And most important thing,	1249.874	1.556
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that at the very first space, they
have problem in their business model.	1251.621	3.754
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	When it is so hard to
bring money in company,	1255.871	2.344
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and you have to spend a lot
of money to bring that money,	1258.24	3.412
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	then there is problem.	1261.903	0.857
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	You must have heard from
influencers that there ROAS is 2.4.	1262.785	5.568
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	For example, by spending 2.4 rupees
on ads, they are earning 10 rupees.	1269.163	3.381
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Now, their ROAS should increase.
Like, Nykaa has ROAS of 7.8.	1273.121	5.589
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	So technically the thing
is, ROAS is stagnant.	1279.102	4.223
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	This is stagnant for company!	1284.029	1.523
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Your ROAS should increase,	1285.848	2.748
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	means how much return you
are getting on the money you spent,	1288.81	5.58
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	that return should
increase over time.	1294.415	1.88
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	And it is not increasing in the company!	1296.516	1.476
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Many people are saying,	1298.161	1.406
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	it is not increasing because the customers
they acquired before are not repeating,	1299.592	4.357
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and every time they have to acquire new
customers and they have to run ads for that.	1304.08	3.468
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	Which is a good point to consider.	1307.99	2.127
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	But I've told you
many things in detail.	1310.357	3.254
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	If you ask me, you
shouldn't invest in this IPO.	1313.83	3.43
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	I am sure, many of your
doubts would be cleared,	1317.548	4.175
kTIJ6gxNBK8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIJ6gxNBK8	and you've learnt many such
things which no one will tell you.	1321.748	3.138

425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Hello everyone my name is Pasi Havia and I'm the 
portfolio manager of HCP Focus and HCP Quant funds.	0.48	6.96
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Today we are going to talk about concentrated 
investing and we have arrived to the capital	8.1	6.3
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	of Latvia to Riga. I'm sitting here together with 
Julia Bistrova from Alpinox. Julia, would you please	14.4	8.58
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	introduce yourself and your company briefly? 
Hello everyone, hello Pasi and I'm glad that	22.98	6.54
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	you come here with your team and we can talk about 
concentrated equity investing so I'm Julia Bistrova	29.52	8.52
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	and I'm a partner of Alphinox. Alphinox stands for 
alpha and that's the independent asset manager	38.04	6.66
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	and which are trying to contradict the common 
stereotype that active asset managers cannot	44.7	7.98
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	beat the market so if you check our historical 
performance you will see that we are doing that	52.68	5.16
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	and we intend to do it also in the future with 
our top products that's the best companies which	57.84	6.66
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	we can select from the stock exchanges and which 
can offer superior performance to our clients.	64.5	7.5
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	So can you also speak more about HCP and tell 
about your most important products? Yes, we are	72.0	8.22
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	are Finnish asset manager and we actually manage 
four different kind of funds. We have two different	80.22	6.06
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	equity funds. One which is concentrated on 
value equities and then the other one which is	86.28	6.06
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	concentrated on growth equities which I think 
resembles more of your concentrated approach as	92.34	6.3
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	well. Then two other funds what we have is one is 
a multi-strategy fund using multi-style as well so	98.64	8.22
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	that is more like how to get the best risk-adjusted 
return performance so that's more concentrated	106.86	9.78
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	or looking like the downside risk as well and 
then we also have a real estate fund which is	116.64	5.76
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	our latest fund which started roughly one year ago 
that invests to Finnish and and Swedish real estate.	122.4	7.74
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Now, talking about your your concentrated fund 
could you also like tell us what is the main theme	131.52	9.42
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	behind this fund? So the main theme, the 
main topics, these are the best companies as I have	140.94	7.5
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	already mentioned that we can find. So what does it 
mean for us? How do we select these companies?	148.44	5.7
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Obviously this is the fundamental financial 
analysis which the majority of fund managers know	154.14	7.14
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	and that's the basics but on top of that 
we usually do the qualitative analysis that's a	161.28	7.86
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	business model analysis and determination of 
competitive advantage of a particular company. So	169.14	5.82
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	it's important for us that the company is having 
an economic moat and that this economic moat is	174.96	6.3
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	not being deteriorated but rather on the opposite 
side that the company is expanding its operations	181.26	6.42
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	globally and expanding its product offering, 
also investing in R&D which is very important	187.68	7.44
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	prerequisite for companies future development. 
On top of that we are doing corporate governance	195.12	6.54
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	analysis which is a must for us and 
which is a determinant of a quality analysis. And	201.66	7.2
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	if we talk also about ESG that we usually 
do this analysis as well as we believe that	210.18	6.24
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	this is a rather value adding element 
in the analytical process. So these	216.42	7.74
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	all steps that we are proceeding with 
allows us to select really the best companies	224.16	7.44
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	which are resilient to economic crisis and 
which are able to offer good performance.	231.6	6.6
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	So, we don't have this sector bias, we 
don't look at sectors, so we rather look	238.86	7.38
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	at companies fundamentals and business model 
quality. So that's our approach. Do you	246.24	6.48
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	have a similar kind of approach or is it totally 
different with your focused products? This is	252.72	7.86
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	very interesting to hear because actually I 
identify that there are certain points which are	260.58	5.7
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	similar which are also the same 
what we are looking as well. Like you were	266.28	6.12
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	talking about economic moats, this is certainly 
like one of the critical things what we look in	272.4	5.52
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	in the HCP Focus fund as well that the company needs 
to have have a strong moat so then it can be	277.92	5.58
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	challenged that easily and it can also then keep 
its position in the market as well. And you were	283.5	7.26
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	also telling that you are looking at the 
corporate governance, this is also what we're looking	290.76	5.4
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	in the HCP Focus fund as well. We are more like interested to see that	296.16	6.0
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	the governance is in place, it's working 
well but also that there's nothing any wrongdoings	302.16	6.36
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	in the history because that is something that we 
don't want to get involved with because if there's this	308.52	5.22
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	kind of a corporate culture it's usually not a 
very good sign. You were talking about	313.74	6.54
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	R&D that you are interested of companies that 
are investing in R&D and here we come to maybe	320.28	7.74
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	like how our process differs a little bit from 
yours like this fundamental approach that we are also	328.02	6.0
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	interested in R&D but maybe with a 
little bit different perspective like	334.02	5.94
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	for the valuation of the companies we are using 
Economic Value Added model, so EVA, and you	340.68	7.2
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	know usually in accounting the investments into 
R&D they are just costs usually in	347.88	6.96
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	the balance sheet but in the EVA model those are 
seen as investments and they are divided for the	354.84	6.96
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	next five years for example. So if the company 
is heavily investing into R&D and it's expected	361.8	6.12
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	that you will get more revenue in the future 
and the EVA model then takes this into account.	367.92	6.3
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	The other things what we also look at for 
the companies that they need to have at least	375.06	5.82
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	one but preferably more megatrends behind them. 
This is because then we find it's maybe a	380.88	7.86
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	little bit easier for the company 
to run its business. Then let's say that	388.74	5.04
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	if you're operating in industry that is 
not in favor anymore so usually you are then	393.78	7.68
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	working in an environment where around 
you the business opportunities are going down	401.46	7.14
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	and so on. So these are few things and nice to 
see that there are several like these points	408.6	6.54
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	which connect with with each other. Can I 
ask about the megatrends	415.14	7.68
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	example so maybe you can mention	422.82	2.0
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	just to you know to taste this flavor. 
How you select so what are the	425.16	6.36
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	most prominent megatrends you see now and how 
do you act upon them? So what type of companies	431.52	7.86
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	are kind of riding these trends? Yes, 
well, at the moment for example we have quite many	439.38	7.02
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	companies which you could describe that they 
are platform companies and they also benefit	446.4	4.44
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	from the digitalization megatrend as well but 
this is more like in the past and what we are	450.84	9.72
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	now looking for the future is for example this 
green transition what is going on. This is pushed	460.56	7.44
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	by the governments as well and there's a real 
need also because these days countries want to	468.0	6.54
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	be more independent with the energy and so on. And 
that's why we see that this is now like emerging	474.54	6.3
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	new megatrend which is probably gonna last not 
only one decade but many decades because these	480.84	6.84
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	kind of projects like let's say building a new energy 
plant or something they are really big projects	487.68	7.26
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	and they really take a long time. Inside here we 
are not interested of so much of like companies	494.94	7.98
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	which are very capital intensive. We like those which 
are like asset light for example. And that's why we	502.92	6.6
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	are more like in this green transition we've 
been now looking into a so-called green tech.	509.52	5.46
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	More like this technology perspective like 
how you can maybe be more energy efficient,	515.82	8.58
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	what kind of solutions is available and so on. 
So this is like one thing what we are looking at	524.4	6.9
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	the moment going further. That's very 
interesting. I like that you said that you	531.3	7.74
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	are in favor of more asset light. We have 
absolutely the same. We don't like capital	539.04	6.12
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	intensive businesses because obviously they have 
to carry on very heavy balance sheets and usually	545.16	6.84
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	the margins, the profitability is kind of 
suffering because of that. But maybe you can name	552.0	6.3
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	some examples of kind of vivids with followers of 
this green technology trend if that's possible?	558.3	10.86
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	At the moment we are not at the company level with 
the green transition study what we are	569.16	6.12
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	doing. We've been working on it already 
several months. But I can also like maybe you to	575.28	7.68
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	get a little bit more flavor what kind 
of changes we have been doing. Our latest addition	582.96	4.26
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	is from UK. Housing market platform called Rightmove. That is the latest addition what we have had.	587.22	6.9
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	And the latest one which we actually kicked 
out was Amazon. One of the reasons	594.12	7.38
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	why we kicked out the Amazon is that it has had a 
tremendous growth but now how we see is that	601.5	7.8
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	the biggest growth period is now behind Amazon. 
It's margins have been now declining as well. At the	609.3	7.32
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	same time we are seeing more this regulatory 
risk popping up which weren't there like few years	616.62	7.62
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	ago. Like now this, let's say like too mega-size 
companies, have a real risk that the regulator	624.24	6.24
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	in Europe, China or United States may, they might, 
step in they want want to maybe even split up	630.48	6.78
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	the company like happened in China with Jack 
Ma's company was now split into six pieces.	637.26	6.06
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	That's why we are also now searching maybe 
a little bit smaller (size) than than previously	643.86	7.32
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	these companies... Yeah, I agree 
that this regulator risk is a very obvious	651.18	6.42
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	and we used to have it with some companies before and, 
yes, it can even grow in its size and... But how,	657.6	9.6
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Julia, how... What, where are you like looking for 
at the moment with your concentrated fund?	667.2	5.76
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	What kind of opportunities are you interested in 
and why? For instance this AI trend. That's really	672.96	6.36
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	a megatrend and that will drive productivity 
of the companies to the new level. To the next	679.32	5.52
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	level that's kind of next revolution, I would 
say. So that's that's indeed a megatrend and	684.84	7.02
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	therefore we have increased our Microsoft holdings 
and we have decreased, we actually kicked out of	691.86	7.26
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	the portfolio, Alphabet because Google is behind, 
behind that in the AI race and we don't	699.12	9.06
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	want to risk it in the long term. So yeah, 
megatrend is part of our process but we do not...	708.18	8.46
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	So it is not in the heart of our process. It's there so we follow and we also	717.54	8.76
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	recognize this green trend and ESG trend which has 
started a few years ago and will continue also in	726.3	7.44
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	the future but it's not really that... It's just one of the factors that we we consider	733.74	7.56
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	and recognize. The AI definitely has been like 
the hype word for this year and that's a	741.3	7.56
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	for example for our HCP Focus fund that's been 
one of the drivers for the performance for this	748.86	6.78
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	year. We have overweighted two stocks which is 
Nvidia and Meta. They both actually are	755.64	9.0
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	benefiting from the AI. Nvidia obviously 
because it's providing the solutions to	764.64	7.02
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	make these very intensive computations what 
are needed for different AI models and so on.	771.66	5.94
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Also surprisingly Meta because they outsourced the 
LLaMa, their own AI model. It's also seen that	777.6	8.76
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	it might be becoming even some kind of a platform for the future as well. So this has been... Well this	786.36	7.62
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	is also like something what is very, how would I 
say, when you do concentrated investing that you	793.98	7.74
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	see like okay when you find the right spots you 
get a tremendous upside from there as well like	801.72	6.48
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	we've had now with Nvidia and Meta and so on. 
So, also going further from here like how many	808.2	9.18
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	equities you have in your concentrated fund? Was it 
eight or...? Yeah, it was eight. We call it Top 8.	817.38	5.22
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Historically we have been with 
this number. We have been asking from... So our	822.6	10.56
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	clients who were asking us... What 
about diversification? It's like you have so	833.16	7.14
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	much risk in that but in fact if you check 
beta it is before this crash in 2022	840.3	9.54
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	beta was below one. So it's if you have not so many 
stocks in the portfolio it doesn't mean that you	849.84	7.86
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	necessarily have very high risk characteristics. 
You can have very good stable	857.7	7.44
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	companies which are delivering 
high value added and they do not have very	865.14	6.72
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	volatile stock price profiles so it's the... You 
cannot argue that if you have so many, so little	871.86	9.66
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	number of companies in the portfolio, that your 
risk is high. Yes, of course we are not	881.52	7.98
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	having here 200 companies like Peter Lynch in 
his portfolio but still it is the risk figures are	889.5	7.62
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	bearable and that's fine. We invest in 
large diversified companies, large global companies	897.12	8.76
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	which can offer quite okay risk profile. 
How do you deal with the risk in this Focus	905.88	8.46
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	fund by HCP? We have a obviously a bit different 
kind of approach in that matter that we don't	914.34	8.4
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	care about the volatility that much. We have a 
very long investment approach that when	922.74	7.68
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	we take a position, like this Amazon for example, 
that was our longest holding in the fund. It was	930.42	6.12
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	from the beginning of the fund and we held it 
for more than a decade before now then sold it out.	936.54	5.58
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	This is something what we are aiming at that 
we could actually when we take the position that	942.12	5.1
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	we could be there very long term like preferably 
over 10 years. So we are not that interested	947.22	7.26
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	in like how the company is doing in short term. 
We are more likely interested that, okay, we will	954.48	6.54
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	never know like short-term how 
things go but if the megatrend is there,	961.02	5.22
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	if the company has its moat, it will eventually then 
play out the thesis what we have here behind it.	966.24	5.88
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Both our processes have very 
concentrated approach. You have only 8	973.8	6.3
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	equities. We have 12. So very, very concentrated. 
I was reading one study from Harvard which was	980.1	9.42
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	coming to conclusions that if a portfolio 
manager or those portfolio managers who	989.52	4.08
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	actually are using concentrated approach they are 
having from 2.8 to up to 4.5 percent alpha yearly.	993.6	9.42
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	But on the other hand I also found some 
opinions like Mohnish Pabrai was saying that	1004.46	5.22
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	if you are having very concentrated approach 
you might fall in love with the stock	1010.28	5.4
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	or you might be only studying one kind of 
industry and then you might be a little bit blind	1015.68	5.1
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	like what's happening outside. What's 
your opinion about this? How do you think?	1020.78	5.16
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Obviously we are the followers and... We should agree with the first study that	1027.2	8.04
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	best ideas, concentration on best ideas, can 
generate outperformance. That's what we can	1035.24	6.42
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	prove and you can also prove. We are believers 
that we have to concentrate portfolios and focus on	1041.66	9.06
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	the best ones. I clearly understand that we are 
humans and we have biases. We have emotional	1050.72	8.88
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	biases, we have a cognitive biases and therefore 
to tackle these biases we have to have very strict	1059.6	6.54
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	investment process and that's what we actually do in our company. We are having monthly	1066.14	8.46
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	decision making with the investment committee 
so it's not only analyst who is responsible	1074.6	6.3
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	for portfolio, for buy and sell list but also the 
investment committee. Investment committee	1080.9	8.88
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	in the year and also in practice they helped to 
avoid or to minimize these cognitive and emotional	1089.78	8.64
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	biases. I clearly understand also that 
portfolio manager or analyst can fall in love with	1098.42	7.5
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	a particular company and that because 
also of its holding period and especially if the	1105.92	6.78
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	performance was really good and it's sometimes hard to part with the company. Alhough we	1112.7	6.12
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	can see some some kind of evidence that the 
company's business model is deteriorating, we	1118.82	8.82
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	still should be thinking 
emotionless and just really valuate hard	1128.18	8.52
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	facts and make make a decisions to say bye 
to the company. But this is being reached	1136.7	7.44
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	with the help of the joint decision making 
so it's not only dependence on one person.	1144.14	5.28
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	How do you deal with that? Oh, this 
is interesting because we have quite different	1149.42	5.88
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	approach in this one. We don't... We are not 
believers of investment committees ourselves.	1155.3	5.88
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	The reason behind that is that we are 
thinking that if there's more and more people	1161.9	4.8
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	coming up together to do the investment 
decision then it's gonna go more closer to like	1167.72	7.14
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	what is average decision making. That's why we are more like leaning towards that there's only one or	1174.86	8.64
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	two or maybe maximum three people like involved 
with the decision making that then you can just	1183.5	6.18
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	bravely make this decision and you can have your opinion about the company and stand behind	1190.46	6.72
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	it. If you need to prove it to lots of people 
and so on then you might not be able to, you know,	1197.18	8.4
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	push through the decision making also. So we have a 
quite different... It's interesting to see that even	1205.58	7.26
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	though we're both concentrated we are tackling 
this issue in a very different ways.	1212.84	7.92
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	I think when you have this investment committee 
in a place I think then it's probably a bit easier	1220.76	6.12
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	for the portfolio manager to, like you said ,to 
handle this different kind of psychological	1226.88	4.8
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	biases and so on. Maybe in our side it's maybe a 
bit harder for the portfolio manager that they	1231.68	7.86
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	will be then more exposed to all kind of these 
things but then I think maybe on as a balancing	1239.54	7.98
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	act then the portfolio manager can maybe make 
more independent decision on the other hand. Okay,	1247.52	7.44
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	but till that point of time you managed to avoid 
or to minimize these biases, right? Well... Yeah, we	1254.96	10.26
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	have had... Of course we cannot hit perfectly 
with every position what we had and sometimes	1265.22	6.84
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	we've been also cutting out positions exactly 
because of those reasons. The latest	1272.06	6.42
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	one which I can name is that we've seen that now 
this issue with the China, the regulations	1278.48	7.68
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	in there, how you can trust the numbers. They 
became so relevant that we actually cut out all	1286.16	6.18
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	the positions in China and we then made out that, 
okay, we are not going to invest to the China	1292.34	6.54
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	at the moment anymore until we see that things 
improve in there. I perfectly understand your	1298.88	7.38
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	pain. We used to have Emerging Markets portfolio 
where China obviously had the very large	1306.26	7.62
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	bias, very large there, but it has been lots of cases, 
lots of times when government was just influencing	1313.88	12.3
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	too much in the the private business 
and at a certain point of time we just said:	1326.18	6.12
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	"Stop, that's enough." On top of that there's some other problems in China like	1332.96	7.38
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	frauds. They are very common there so it's, you know, it's like minefield and we decided no.	1340.34	5.22
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Julia, in your very concentrated best ideas 
portfolio can you name some interesting names	1346.4	8.46
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	which are maybe not that well known or so 
but which are like really interesting for you?	1354.86	5.64
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Right, yes, we do have some companies which are not really commonly discussed	1360.5	7.68
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	in Twitter for instance or in the investment 
communities and these are	1368.18	5.34
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	large-caps but not very well known to the general 
investment public. I would say that one of them	1373.52	6.18
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	is Sika. This is a Swiss construction 
material maker and they are making additives to	1379.7	8.1
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	concrete for instance or they are making this 
construction glue. These products are very	1387.8	6.96
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	high value and the company 
is really global and it serves the construction	1394.76	8.64
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	industry and also the maintenance industry so 
it's resilience to the economics... It is resilient	1403.4	7.98
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	to economic cycles and historical performance of 
Sika is just splendid and this is a really company	1411.38	7.74
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	worth paying attention to. Also what we like 
a lot they invest in R&D so they are innovation	1419.12	7.92
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	obsessed company. They are constantly launching new 
products. And now it's my turn to ask you the same	1427.04	7.56
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	question. Can you name some not very 
obvious but very promising company titles?	1434.6	7.86
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	I think the latest addition what we had 
is something what probably not everyone is	1443.18	6.18
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	heard of is this Rightmove. It's a platform 
company for housing market in UK so basically	1449.36	7.62
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	what they are doing is that if you are a 
landlord or you want to to sell your house and	1456.98	6.84
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	then this is a platform where the British people go. They have a 85 percent market	1464.48	4.74
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	share in the UK and they are pretty much the market over there. So what this means is that	1469.22	8.52
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	pretty much every broker if they want to 
sell the house or apartment or office building	1477.74	6.48
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	or something they need to list in Rightmove. 
Now, also because there's been this downturn like	1484.22	5.88
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	what's been, you know, one way kind of funny is that 
even though the markets have been cooling down but	1490.1	6.18
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	now there's been these new developments 
and the developers previously they didn't have	1496.28	4.62
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	the need to list anything because they were 
selling like hot cake or whatever that	1500.9	7.5
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	sells fast. But now they need to rely on 
like Rightmove for example to get more exposed and	1508.4	6.3
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	visibility for the developments to get them 
sold. They also get the ad revenues, they also get	1514.7	8.64
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	revenues by providing statistics to municipalities and so on. They also provide their own market	1523.34	8.94
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	price index which is the most accurate price index 
looking forward what there is in the UK so this is	1532.28	8.52
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	not that big as Amazon but like I said earlier 
that now we are looking a little bit smaller	1540.8	5.46
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	size of companies which are small this, you 
know, time left to really take off and so on.	1546.26	8.04
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	They have already started to expand to 
to different countries. They are now in several	1554.3	5.22
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	different European countries, also in Thailand 
and United States. This is like something	1559.52	5.82
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	what has been like recently very interesting for 
us and which we have picked into our portfolio.	1565.34	5.52
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Thank you Julia, it was very interesting  to discuss with you today. Where can our	1571.82	5.34
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	viewers find more information about 
Alphinox and your concentrated fund?	1577.16	4.14
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	Yeah, you can find it on our website on alphinox.com	1581.3	5.418

about the Top 8 strategy and historical	1587.6	5.4
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	performance figures. So now it's my turn to 
thank you and I learned a lot and also got	1593.0	7.14
425IsKT8BaI	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425IsKT8BaI	some investment ideas which I need to check. Can you tell where	1600.14	7.32

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	practice trades. Now let's take	148.466	7.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	a quick look, though at the	153.3	5.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	market as we're getting started	154.433	5.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	here just because, Hey, it is	156.433	7.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	interested. This is the S and P	158.5	5.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	500. Everybody And you'll notice	160.4	6.166
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	on the chart, and we're gonna	163.533	5.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	come back to this in a little	164.5	5.133
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	bit on the chart because we've	166.666	4.534
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	talked about trend in this class	168.633	3.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	before we've talked about trends	169.733	4.567
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	and upward trend being a series	171.3	5.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	of higher highs, higher lows,	173.166	6.134
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	okay, and we can see that	174.4	7.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	generally occurring on the S and	176.4	6.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	P 500. Now I also have on this	179.4	7.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	chart a 50 Day, which is in red	181.533	8.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	moving average. And 20 Day,	183.433	9.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	moving average the stock or in	187.333	7.233
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	this case index is above both of	190.366	6.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	these, and they're both sloping	193.366	5.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	upwards. We can use that to help	194.666	5.734
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	identify a trend. In fact, we're	196.533	6.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	going to make use of that very	198.5	5.866
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	fact. Later as we run a scan, as	200.5	5.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	I show you how to do a scan to	203.366	5.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	try and a simple scan to try and	204.466	6.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	find a trend. That's up there.	206.433	7.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Okay Now, From this start,	209.333	5.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	there's a lot of different ways	211.433	6.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	. You could potentially look at	213.566	5.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the market but in the context of	215.366	5.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	this upper trend upward trend	217.566	5.634
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	we've had a little bit of a	219.533	4.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	pullback. A little bit more of a	221.333	5.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	flag pattern. And if you are	223.3	6.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	interested, I teach about flags	224.566	5.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	on Tuesdays at 9 30 Eastern	227.3	7.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	time. You're welcome to join me	229.433	6.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	there. Okay, but By using this	230.433	8.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	overall trend in the market with	234.4	8.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that may help to influence our	236.4	9.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	decision on whether to trade or	239.366	9.834
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	not trade. Furthermore just	243.3	8.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	because the S and P 500 is going	246.4	9.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	up, it doesn't mean every	250.166	9.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	component of the S and P 500 is	251.5	9.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	going up. It may mean that some	256.3	7.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	sectors are doing better than	259.3	6.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	others, and that leads us	261.3	7.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	exactly to the point of top down	263.466	7.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	analysis. This may be a term	265.466	6.834
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that's new to you. Maybe not.	268.466	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Essentially what top down	271.333	8.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	analysis is, is it's taking into	272.4	9.133
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	account first. What a broader	275.533	8.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	designation is doing, such as	280.3	5.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the sector industry group and	281.633	8.567
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	then trying to find an	284.366	7.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	individual stock from there. Now	285.5	8.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	think about how you normally	290.3	5.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	look for stocks. That may not be	291.533	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the approach that you normally	294.433	6.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	use very often say you're a	296.3	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	value investor. Maybe you look	298.533	6.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	for some metrics regarding PE	301.3	5.3
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	ratios or price to sales ratios	303.3	5.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	or something like that, or	306.166	4.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	you're a growth investor and you	306.7	5.666
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	look for cash flow growth or	308.6	6.666
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	earnings growth. Okay Or maybe	310.366	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	you're just a trench trader and	312.466	7.734
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	you start by looking at stocks	315.366	8.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that have a good trend. Well,	317.433	7.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that is all fine, but What I	320.3	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	want you to consider this	324.333	5.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Whether you do a top down	325.4	6.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	analysis where we first look at	327.3	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	how this sector is doing or	329.433	5.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	whether you do a bottom up	332.3	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	analysis, where your first	334.3	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	looking at, you know qualities	335.4	7.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	of that individual stock what I	339.3	7.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	would encourage you to do either	341.3	8.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	way is Don't Neglect to look at	343.3	9.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	what the sector is doing. Okay	346.5	8.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	because a stock's performance if	350.3	5.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	you would attribute if you look	353.366	4.834
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	at a stock's performance stock	354.8	6.566
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	may do well for, you know, maybe	356.3	6.266
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	it's own purposes. But really,	358.3	6.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	typically, if you look at most	361.466	6.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stocks, their performance is	362.666	8.667
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	going to follow pretty much in	365.366	8.834
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	line for in general, I'm making	368.366	7.834
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the generalization here. Hmm	371.433	6.167
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	What the sector is doing Most	374.3	5.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stocks in a particular sector	376.3	5.133
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	tend to be pretty correlated	377.7	6.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	with one another. There may be	380.3	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	exceptions. Therefore if you	381.533	7.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	find a sector that is doing well	384.433	6.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	And you think it's going to	387.3	6.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	continue to do well, You're	388.666	7.667
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	probably better off looking for	391.3	7.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stocks within that sector than a	394.366	6.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	sector that you think. Well, the	396.433	6.133
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	sector may not do well. But I	399.3	5.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	think this stock may stand alone	400.566	5.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	in that sector. That's the	402.666	8.534
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	theory that is the theory	404.5	7.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	behind. Top down analysis. Okay	406.533	10.667
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	That's what we do. Now, let's do	411.3	7.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	this. Let's let's think about Uh	412.533	7.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	, let's just think about the	417.3	6.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	market here for a sec, and what	419.366	5.834
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	I'm gonna do is You know,	420.466	6.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	there's a lot of stocks out	423.466	5.734
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	there in the market. Okay How	425.3	5.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	many stocks in the market? Well	427.366	6.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	thousands over 10,000 publicly	429.3	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	traded stocks out there. So lots	430.466	8.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	, lots of stocks and we can	434.4	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	break that down. Into we can	436.3	7.166
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	narrow down into more of a	439.433	6.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	narrow category into sectors.	441.4	7.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	How many sectors are there? Well	443.566	7.634
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	there's a kind of 11 sectors	446.4	7.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that we typically characterizes	448.5	6.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	sectors. Okay And so that	451.3	5.233
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	narrows it down. That's more	453.5	5.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	specific. You see how we can	455.3	4.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	kind of funnel things down into	456.633	4.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	specific sector and beneath the	458.8	6.4
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	sector. You may talk about a	460.366	7.834
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	subsector or will usually call	461.666	10.534
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	it like an industry group. Okay	465.3	8.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	and so in each sector There's	468.3	9.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	different industry groups. So	472.3	8.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	for example, in, um let's say	474.366	9.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the information technology	478.366	7.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	sector. You may have software as	480.5	7.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	a particular industry. You may	484.366	7.834
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	have semiconductors as a	485.466	8.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	different industry. Okay so or	488.4	7.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	in utilities, you may have gas	492.3	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	utilities as one industry and	493.633	4.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	electric utilities are	495.6	4.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	different, So you see how it's	497.3	5.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	getting more narrow. And then	498.466	6.734
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	within this industry, there's	500.4	6.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	individual stocks. Okay? So	502.466	5.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	sometimes we kind of think of	505.3	5.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	this is top down analysis. We	506.6	5.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	kind of funnel it down now you	508.533	5.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	don't need to go through every	511.3	5.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	step. But we just looked at the	511.9	7.3
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	SPX, the S and P 500 as kind of	513.7	9.5
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	a representative of the overall	516.466	13.734
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	market. What if we found A	519.3	15.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stronger sector. Here. As kind	523.3	14.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	of a prelude. To trying to find	530.3	9.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	a stock now just because we find	535.3	6.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	a strong sector doesn't mean	538.166	4.3
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	number one that it's necessarily	540.3	6.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	going to continue to go forward.	541.5	6.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Go up. And also just because we	543.166	6.167
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	find a strong structure doesn't	546.6	4.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	mean a particular stocks can go	548.3	6.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	up. But it doesn't sound like a	549.433	8.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	bad start. To me. Here as we do	551.333	8.233
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	this all right now. So how do we	554.466	7.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	do that? How do we locate what a	557.566	8.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	strong sector is? Well, you can	559.666	8.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	do it different ways. But let me	562.4	8.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	just mention this to you if	565.666	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	you're on the TD Ameritrade	568.533	7.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	website. I'm going to go back to	570.533	6.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	think or swim here in a little	572.666	4.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	bit, But I just want you to	575.666	3.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	realize You can do it on both.	576.833	4.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Okay if you're on the Chiti	577.733	6.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Ameritrade website. You can go	579.633	6.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	up to research and ideas. You	582.4	6.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	know, that's a big menu pops up.	584.6	8.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	You can go to sectors. And	586.533	8.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	industries. And it's gonna bring	588.6	9.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	up different sectors. Now the	594.4	6.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	default here is one day. Now I'm	595.533	7.167
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	not going to spend much time on	598.6	7.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the one day view and the reason	600.6	7.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	is Anything can happen One on	604.4	6.166
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	any given day, right? You know,	606.533	5.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	you look at the stock one day	607.733	5.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	it's up the next day, it's down.	610.666	4.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	What we're trying to see is more	611.633	7.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	of a broader movement within	613.533	6.133
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	those sectors. So I can change.	614.833	8.6
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	I can just click on where it	618.8	5.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	says one day and I can go to one	619.766	7.834
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	week or one month or three	623.533	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	months now. I just as I was	624.633	9.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	saying one day is probably too	627.7	8.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Too short a time period. And for	630.6	7.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that we can make consider it a	634.666	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	little bit to be born noise in	636.566	5.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	terms of the overall trend,	638.533	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Okay? On the other hand, I would	639.666	8.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	say going to five years or one	642.633	8.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	year or even maybe six months,	645.6	8.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	maybe on the long term end of	648.566	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	things. Where look, it's stock	651.666	6.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that was doing or a sector that	654.533	5.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	was doing well. A year ago, they	655.633	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	could completely have changed at	658.633	6.233
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	this point. Therefore I'm going	659.733	5.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	to use a more intermediate term	662.7	5.133
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	time frame. In this case. I'm	664.966	4.534
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	going to look at one month, so	665.7	5.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	I'm gonna select one month and	667.933	5.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	we can see what sectors have	669.6	7.133
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	been showing more strength over	671.633	8.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the past month. Well information	673.766	8.667
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	technology. Uh, Uh, is kind of	676.833	7.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the top performer over the last	680.666	5.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	month. Communication services,	682.533	6.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	uh, is doing well. Consumer	685.4	6.133
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	discretionary is doing well, and	686.7	6.866
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	there's others, but those three	688.633	7.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	seemed to stand out and staples	691.633	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	and utilities have lacked Now	693.666	7.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	there may be some reasons that	696.6	6.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	some of these sectors are doing	698.633	6.3
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	better than others. And that can	700.833	4.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	be a very broad discussion that	702.7	4.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	I'm not going to get into too	705.033	5.433
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	much today. Although let me just	705.766	7.667
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	say this. When the market as a	707.633	9.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	whole is doing better. Some	710.566	8.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	sectors tend to do better. Okay	713.533	9.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	we'll call those often like	717.533	7.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	cyclical type move sectors,	719.633	8.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	whereas when the market as a	722.7	7.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	whole is not doing very well,	724.833	9.6
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	which characterizes Probably a	728.566	7.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	lot of 2022 to be honest. You	730.566	7.134
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	know what sectors were doing	734.533	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	better than well, Let's look at	735.733	7.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the bottom of the list. Utility	737.8	7.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	staples tend to tend to they	739.533	9.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	actually did a little better	743.533	6.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	during the past year. When the	745.533	5.167
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	market was getting beat up.	748.7	3.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	We'll call those defensive	749.833	5.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	sectors. Okay, defensive not	750.8	6.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	meaning. Defense industry,	752.6	6.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Lockheed Martin or anything like	755.566	5.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that. What we mean by defensive	757.633	6.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	is there when you were more of a	759.533	6.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	defensive risk, we were more	761.566	5.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	concerned about risk the risk of	764.533	5.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the market. People will kind of	765.666	7.834
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Flee to those types sectors.	767.533	7.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Okay So that's what this is.	770.533	6.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	That's what we're talking about.	773.6	5.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	But right now what sectors are	774.666	5.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stronger, we got these sectors	776.733	5.767

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	red. The red just means they've	1046.566	8.9

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	a shift of money. Out you know	1071.5	8.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	from other sectors into more.	1075.5	6.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	The These are more popular now.	1076.6	7.133

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	look and I can kind of look at	1083.833	5.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the trend, and it's probably	1086.666	5.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	true if I go to utilities here,	1087.266	9.134
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	um Here's utilities and to my	1090.366	7.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	prior point, by the way, Of	1091.833	7.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	we're not going to put too much	1096.5	6.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	focus on one day's movement.	1097.666	6.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	What utilities doing today? It's	1099.833	11.567
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	up almost 1.5% today. Nice	1102.6	11.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	candle there, right? Okay? So.	1104.7	10.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Hmm Yeah, I'm not work. But look	1111.5	5.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	at what the general trend is	1113.766	4.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	doing. The general trend is not	1115.5	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	doing so hot on this is it Even	1116.633	4.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	though it's up today, let's go	1118.633	6.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	to staples. Same thing. We're	1120.5	6.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	up. A little bit today. Not as	1121.6	7.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	much, but the general trend is	1124.933	6.567
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	down. That's why I'm kind of	1127.566	6.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Discounting a little bit what	1128.7	6.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the one day return has been on	1131.6	7.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	these even though they're	1133.7	6.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	positive because Of what the	1134.866	10.534
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	overall market is doing, whereas	1139.5	7.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	I t It's down today, but the	1140.633	8.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	general trend has been up	1145.5	5.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	discretionary. Same Same same	1146.633	9.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	and you can see that there.	1148.766	11.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Alright, so. As we do this what	1150.633	11.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	you can do is you can, um we can	1156.6	7.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	identify those areas that we	1160.633	5.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	have strength that we want to	1162.566	4.134
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	look at. Okay Now there's a	1163.8	5.666
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	question in the chat. The	1165.733	5.667
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	question is, Can we save the	1166.8	8.6
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	custom columns with the watch	1169.566	6.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	list? Those are separate things	1171.5	6.166
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	. But here's what I would	1175.5	4.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	suggest This is just a little	1176.6	4.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	bit of a signal, but I think it	1177.766	5.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	will help everybody out in terms	1179.7	6.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	of your management as you go	1182.366	4.6
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	forward with, think or swim. You	1183.566	5.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	can have a lot of different	1186.5	3.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	watch lists, right? Like I have	1187.066	5.434
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	another watch list up here. Well	1189.6	4.033

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	columns up here on that watch	1192.6	8.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	list. Um And this will stay	1193.733	9.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	here. This will stay here. If I	1196.5	8.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	bring this up tomorrow. This	1200.7	5.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	will still be there. But I can	1202.9	4.5
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	change this to a different watch	1204.6	6.9

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	through a particular resistance	1762.766	4.734

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	potential concern here around	1771.766	9.734
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	70. 73. I want this to break	1773.466	11.0

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	something else We've talked	1788.733	4.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	about in past sessions of this	1789.8	7.666

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	types. If you want to only buy a	1793.466	7.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stock if it breaks above a	1797.566	6.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	certain price, we can use a buy	1799.733	5.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	. Stop order. Okay Remember,	1801.466	5.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Stop orders don't guarantee	1803.666	5.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	we're gonna get into the price.	1805.466	6.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	We can also say, Look, if we	1807.5	5.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	break above here, you know this	1809.466	6.234
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	is a trend trade. But if it	1811.566	7.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	breaks below these recent lows,	1813.533	9.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	which are around 69 I want to	1815.8	8.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stop out of this. Okay So here's	1819.633	6.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	what I'm gonna do. I'm going to	1822.633	7.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	take 69. I'm gonna multiply it	1824.633	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	by 690.97. Okay That's going to	1826.533	10.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	give me a stop level. 66 93 is	1829.766	9.6
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	my stop. Where are we going to	1832.333	10.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	get in? We said we're only going	1837.533	8.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	to get in if it breaks above. 73	1839.466	9.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	OK 73 or above. Okay That's our	1842.466	9.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	entry. Now What about a target?	1845.666	9.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Well I'm not planning on using	1849.466	7.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the target here, and here's why.	1851.766	5.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	There's different types of	1855.466	8.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	trades. Sometimes we may	1856.633	8.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	automate. Or exit. Swing trading	1857.8	11.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	were very often automate the	1864.466	7.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	exit. But. When we're talking	1865.533	8.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	about trend trading, I'm willing	1869.7	6.666
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	to stay in this as long as this	1872.466	5.234
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	trend is going to continue when	1874.6	5.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	you go up. So I'm gonna put in a	1876.466	5.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stop down here and we said the	1877.8	6.666
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stop was going to be right	1880.533	5.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	around just below 67. Stop	1881.566	6.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	around here, so if it breaks	1884.566	5.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	down below here, we're going to	1886.6	5.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	say that That trend is likely	1887.766	9.6
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	breaking at that point. But as	1890.6	10.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	long as it continues to go up	1892.6	10.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	I'm willing to stay with this	1897.466	6.4
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	trade. Now We may move that stop	1901.466	4.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	up along the way. Periodically	1903.333	7.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	as the stock goes up. But for	1903.966	7.4
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	now, That's what we're that's	1905.6	8.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	what we're gonna do. I'm hoping	1910.466	5.234
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that makes sense. Okay, now.	1911.466	6.267
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Question The chat. Is there	1914.466	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	amount above resistance that you	1915.8	4.866
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	recommend as a minimum I've	1917.833	3.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	heard like 11 cents is one of	1919.466	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the questions. Okay, Fair	1920.766	7.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	enough. The answer is a lot of	1921.833	9.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	times what people will do is	1926.533	9.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	they will say, Look, this is a	1928.8	8.666
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	potential area, but I don't want	1931.566	10.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	to imply too much precision with	1935.666	8.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	this line. I just drew Right. Do	1937.566	10.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	I have this line right around 70	1942.466	14.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	to 87. Okay Does that mean that	1944.466	14.267
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	72 88 Uh huh. You get in. That	1950.333	11.133
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	kind of implies too much	1957.466	5.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	precision on your lines or so A	1958.833	5.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	lot of people will put some	1961.566	7.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	amount in the chat, somebody	1962.566	9.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	said 11 cents. 20 Cents is used	1964.833	9.533
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	. Sometimes could you use 1?	1969.466	8.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Absolutely you can. You could	1972.466	7.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	use 1% if you want. Yeah So I	1974.466	7.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	don't care is the bottom line	1978.5	4.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	like the answer is, I don't	1980.466	4.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	think whether you use 11 cents	1982.466	4.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	or 25 cents makes a difference.	1983.566	5.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Just be different. Speak	1985.5	5.066
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	consistent in what you do. In	1986.766	6.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	this case, I said I gave it a	1989.466	6.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	little bit of buffer above where	1990.666	9.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	my line was. And I set up around	1993.566	7.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	73. But, um But, yeah, I don't	1995.6	7.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	feel strongly on the exact	2000.466	5.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	amount there. I've heard. You	2001.633	4.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	know you people use some measure	2003.466	4.167
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	of an A tr above that, too.	2005.6	3.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	There's different ways to do it.	2006.666	4.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	So here's how we're gonna do the	2008.333	5.233

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	can do a stop limiting and	2053.466	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	change that if I want and I	2056.466	7.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	could say Look, my stop is at	2058.566	7.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	73, but I'm not willing If it	2060.533	7.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	was, if it shoots past 74, I'm	2063.6	6.066

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	We're only getting in if we	2080.6	6.866
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	break above here Or stop Well,	2082.533	5.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	our initial stop and we said,	2085.6	5.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Remember, I said, we may adjust	2087.566	10.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that stop along the way, I said	2088.6	11.2

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	here's what I want you to think	2098.466	5.167
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	about for a sec. How far is that	2099.9	5.666
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	? Stop our initial stop going to	2102.466	5.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	be below or entry? Well, it's	2103.733	5.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	going to be roughly 10% in the	2105.666	5.834
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	order, maybe just a little less	2107.666	8.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	than 10% below if we were to get	2109.466	8.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	in at 73 are stop is just a	2111.6	8.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	little bit below 67. That's	2116.466	5.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	about a 10% gap there, which is	2118.466	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	, by the way, a fairly typical	2120.466	6.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	type bulb. Park figure as to	2121.6	10.933

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	here, okay? Just as a recap. We	2165.566	9.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	use the ones that were showing a	2170.533	6.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	little more strength of late. We	2171.733	8.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	started. Look these went from	2175.466	6.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	red to green. They don't	2177.566	6.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	necessarily need to do that. But	2180.466	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that's often the case. These	2181.566	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	went from green to red. They're	2183.666	3.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	kind of going the wrong	2185.466	5.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	direction on us. But it's not	2186.566	6.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	just Buy cheap You can find	2187.7	6.9

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	can change this to make	2194.7	5.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	discretionary. We can just go	2196.466	7.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	here We can go down, change I t	2197.766	9.6
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	and go to discretionary. Okay	2200.5	8.166
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Run the scan. We got six results	2203.566	9.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	. Some of these, you may be	2207.466	7.167
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	aware of Um. D R. Horton home	2208.766	10.6
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	builder. Pulte is a home	2213.566	7.0

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	store. Hmm. We can look at those	2220.666	7.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	. Let's look and see what we	2225.466	8.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	got. Or or what. Okay So here's	2226.6	9.866
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	an example of one. That isn't	2229.333	8.233
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	doing what I wanted to do. Okay	2233.566	5.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	It's not a perfect scan. It's	2236.566	4.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	not going to give you all stocks	2237.666	4.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that are ready to buy right now	2239.6	5.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	. This is one that I was	2241.633	6.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	describing earlier of the trend	2242.733	7.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	actually hasn't been that great	2245.633	6.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	, but it just happened to shoot	2248.466	6.167
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	way up over the past couple of	2250.466	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	days. Above the 20 and the 50	2251.733	7.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Day moving average. So you move	2254.733	6.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	on. Okay so you can look for	2257.466	6.3
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	other other stocks. Here's	2259.7	6.666
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	here's D. R. Horton Okay, This	2261.466	7.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	is another one. That was how's	2263.866	8.5
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the trend? Pretty good. It is	2266.466	7.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	pretty good. Are we bouncing	2269.533	7.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	here? Looks like we're bouncing	2272.466	5.367
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	. And this may take us to our	2274.466	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	entry signals where we discussed	2276.633	5.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	before on the different, you	2277.933	6.467
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	know, different potential entry	2281.466	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	signals that people use.	2282.566	6.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Sometimes people will say, Look	2284.5	4.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	, I want to get it on a bounce.	2286.466	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Some people say well look to	2288.7	5.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	bounce off of potential support.	2289.533	6.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	That may be enough interest for	2291.466	5.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	some people to enter some people	2294.533	4.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	, though, may say Well, look, I	2296.466	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	want this to actually break	2297.533	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	above. Uh the most recent low	2299.466	6.267
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the height of the most recent	2303.466	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	low, which would be right here.	2304.6	4.866
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Either way, you know there's	2305.833	4.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	different ways you can tweak	2308.466	5.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	your injury, but in terms of	2309.566	6.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	trend I think this looks like a	2310.666	6.334
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	trend in terms of our industry	2313.6	4.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	group, in which industry report	2316.466	4.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	it was this industry group	2317.1	7.366
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Discretionary. Uh, we've got a	2318.466	7.167
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	nice nice bounce today. We could	2320.766	7.6
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	potentially enter right now. And	2324.566	5.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that case we don't need to use a	2325.733	8.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	buy. Stop. We could just buy it.	2328.466	7.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Should we buy a market or limit?	2329.7	8.666
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Well, let's do it. Let's let me	2334.466	5.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	go. But I'm gonna put a stop in	2337.333	5.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	on this. You don't have to use a	2338.466	6.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stop, but very often on trend.	2340.5	5.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Trades will use stuff. I'm going	2342.5	5.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	to go below a recent low we had	2344.566	6.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	here. Okay because my feeling is	2345.8	10.566
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	this If we have a low down here,	2347.7	11.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	okay? And our. Stuck breaks	2350.733	9.367
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	below this recent low in other	2356.466	6.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	words, if they're stuck, we're	2359.566	4.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	getting in here if it breaks	2360.2	6.4
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	below the last few days and	2362.6	6.2
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	breaks below this low, not only	2364.466	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	are going to be below the 20,	2366.7	5.666
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	but we're breaking into a lower	2368.9	6.666
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	low at that point and likely	2371.466	6.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	high. If it does go down, this	2372.466	6.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	would be kind of a lower high at	2375.666	4.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that point. It may be a sign	2377.6	4.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that trend is changing. Are you	2378.566	5.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	following me on that? So that's	2380.533	6.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	why I may consider putting a	2382.666	6.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stop down below here and I'm	2384.633	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	going to go again about 3% below	2386.7	10.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that, so I'm just going to take	2389.566	11.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	30.97 times. 94 points. 85 I	2391.7	14.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	come up with 92 bucks? Okay? $92	2397.5	12.1

8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	gonna right click. I'm gonna buy	2406.533	8.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	custom with stop. Let me start	2409.7	6.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	with the stop here for a second	2413.633	3.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	. I'm going to make that stop	2415.466	3.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Good, til canceled because I	2416.566	4.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	don't want to expiring. At the	2417.633	7.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	end of the day We said it was	2419.466	7.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	gonna be $92, okay? Some people	2421.466	9.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	don't like to use stops right at	2425.466	7.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	you know, uh, exact round number	2427.533	7.267
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	. I don't know that that really	2431.466	5.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	makes a huge difference, But I'm	2433.466	5.167
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	gonna put in that 91 99 star.	2434.9	8.566
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Okay if you want, so there's our	2437.5	10.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stop. Now. If we put in a limit	2438.733	12.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	order We're saying I'm not	2443.566	14.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	willing to buy this. Okay? Hold	2447.6	12.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	on one second. I just tweaked my	2451.566	13.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stop. We said 91 night. Okay.	2457.766	10.6
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	I'm not willing to buy this. If	2460.6	13.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	it's below. Excuse me, if it's	2465.533	10.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	more than 98 33. If I do put	2468.466	9.3
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that in, what if the stock jumps	2474.533	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	up to a few cents right away,	2476.333	4.267
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	then I'm it's not gonna fill and	2477.866	5.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	then by the time I go around,	2479.533	4.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	and I can adjust the price, it	2480.7	7.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	may be a much higher price.	2482.966	7.4
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Okay? That's the downside of	2484.6	8.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	limit orders. Now I could do a	2488.533	8.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	market order. And just buy it as	2490.466	8.267
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	soon as possible. Here's what I	2493.533	6.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	would say on that. If you were	2496.733	6.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	well. The market is open during	2498.833	6.633
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	trading hours. If you have a	2500.6	7.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	liquid stock, and it's an S and	2503.466	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	P 500 big company I don't have	2505.566	5.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	any qualms about anybody doing a	2508.666	7.7
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	market order hearing jumping in	2510.466	7.067
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	If the market is not open. Or if	2511.533	8.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the stocks more of a much less	2516.466	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	liquid stock, then maybe I would	2517.633	7.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	think a couple of times about	2520.6	5.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	doing that market order right?	2523.466	4.934
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	You may want to stick with that	2525.5	4.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	woman or and true with options.	2526.666	4.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	We're not talking about options	2528.5	5.133
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	today. But but options you're	2529.6	6.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	not. You're not. I don't see you	2531.733	4.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	doing a market one right? Unless	2533.733	3.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	there's some other contingency	2535.733	3.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	involved with that, okay? So we	2536.766	6.6
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	can do that. And of course,	2537.8	11.566
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	remember, uh, do the math 100	2539.633	15.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	shares Times. 100 shares times.	2543.466	13.167
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	$98 a share is 9800 bucks. Maybe	2549.466	10.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	that's more than what you want.	2555.6	6.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	I'm going to do 50. 50 share	2556.733	6.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	share and remember stops are not	2560.466	7.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	guaranteed, confirming sinned.	2562.6	6.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Yeah then that Okay, so Here's	2563.6	7.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	what we did. Folks. Let me just	2567.6	5.966
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	make sure I think that's kind of	2569.466	5.034
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	what I want to talk about. Oh	2570.733	6.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	When are we going to get out of	2573.666	4.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	these are initial exit rule is	2574.6	5.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	are stop. Okay Broken shred will	2576.866	5.5
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	get us out. Well we're we	2578.566	7.8
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	defined. Our stop would be a	2579.8	10.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	broken trend, okay? So, um The	2582.466	13.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	Um. But we will move that stop	2589.333	9.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	up. Along the way. Will review	2590.633	10.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	it in the future. At this point,	2596.466	7.967
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	though, Broken support breaking	2598.466	7.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	of a trend. Look, here's our	2602.333	5.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	turn. I can draw a line right	2604.533	4.0
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	under here, but really are 20	2605.666	4.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	day moving average is acting as	2607.466	5.134
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	a trend line here. That's a you	2608.633	5.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	know, that's a fairly tight	2610.533	4.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	stuff that you don't want to get	2612.7	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	out if just because we go down a	2614.466	4.9
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	little bit below it. But if the	2615.5	5.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	trend truly breaks that's when	2617.7	6.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	we'll exit there, Okay, A lot of	2619.466	6.134
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	times when you enter a trade If	2620.633	7.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	you're looking at injury trade	2624.533	5.1
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	when the market is just opens,	2625.7	6.766
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	there's a lot of volatility Lot	2628.5	6.033
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	of price movement. Right when	2629.733	7.767
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	the market opens, and for that	2632.566	7.867
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	reason some people avoid trading	2634.633	7.833
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	in that 1st 1st little bit. You	2637.6	6.733
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	may be more likely to do that	2640.533	6.933
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	limit order. Rather than the	2642.566	6.734
8eKqb5gYjoo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKqb5gYjoo	market order when the first hour	2644.433	7.1

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this up to a chart. And I use	396.0	8.666
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the term technical analysis	400.866	6.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	earlier. What is technical	402.1	9.566
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	analysis will technical analysis	404.766	7.967

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a stock and let me just pull up	415.633	6.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Cisco as an example, common	417.0	6.666
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock. What people will do	419.766	5.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	sometimes to analyze as they'll	421.833	4.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	go up to the man analyzed him	423.766	4.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and they'll click on	425.066	4.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	fundamentals, and they'll read	426.066	4.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	all about the financial	427.866	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	performance of the stock. That's	429.933	6.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	called fundamental analysis.	431.033	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Well that's not what I'm going	433.766	6.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to be focusing on today. Just	436.766	4.034
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	realize Today. I'm focusing on	437.966	5.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	technical analysis, but it	440.066	4.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	doesn't. It's not to the	440.9	5.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	exclusion. It doesn't mean you	443.766	3.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	shouldn't be doing fundamental	444.933	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	analysis. It just means it's a	446.066	8.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	different approach to doing it.	447.8	8.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Okay. So here's what we do	449.933	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Technical analysis. As we look	454.766	4.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	at the charts, we may look at	456.633	5.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	him and different time frames,	457.933	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and you can do that right at the	459.8	5.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	top of the page. Right now. I	461.766	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	have a one year one day chart up	463.033	5.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	there. You probably see that	465.0	5.766
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	right there one Why one deep I	466.866	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	can go up to where it says D up	468.8	5.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	here and change that. Sometimes	470.866	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I want may want to look longer	472.933	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	term. I can click on a five year	474.033	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	weekly chart and see what Cisco	475.966	6.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	has done over that period of	477.866	6.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	time. I can click on a Shorter	479.033	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	term chart a one day one minute	482.766	5.034
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	chart and see what it's doing	484.766	4.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	today, But for the most part,	485.966	4.734
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I'm going to use a more	487.9	5.766
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	intermediate term time period.	488.966	5.834
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Something like, say, six months	490.8	7.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. That's what I have. That's	493.766	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	what I have here. But when we're	494.9	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	analyzing these charts, what are	498.033	5.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	we going to focus on? This is	499.766	7.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	what we're going to focus on.	501.9	6.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Let me show you. I'm gonna Just	503.866	7.567
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bring up a blank document and	507.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	say, probably the most important	508.6	6.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	thing that most technicians	511.533	5.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	would identify as the most	513.533	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	important thing. Everybody has	514.733	5.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	different views on it, but I	516.8	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	think most trader most	518.633	5.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	technicians would say one of the	520.533	6.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	key elements of technical	521.733	7.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	analysis is the trend. Okay And	523.933	6.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	by the way, there is a survey	527.6	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	link in the chat, and we	529.533	6.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	appreciate your feedback on	530.7	6.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	those surveys. And when you ask	532.6	5.433
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	questions and surveys often all	535.666	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trying to dress those in our	537.533	5.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	subsequent sessions. The trend.	538.133	6.467
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	What's the stock doing? That's	541.666	4.034
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that's one of the key elements	542.766	5.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that we do with technical	544.7	4.766
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	analysis, other things that we	545.8	5.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	do with technical analysis.	548.533	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Probably that maybe I would	549.566	6.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	guess my opinion. I guess the	551.766	7.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	thing that most traders would	554.6	6.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	say is maybe the second key	556.633	8.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	thing to look at is what we call	559.533	7.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	support. And resistance, Okay,	560.766	9.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and we're gonna talk about each	565.566	6.267
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	of these items here today. Now.	566.733	7.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Other things that people look	570.533	4.533
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	at. Yeah people will look at	571.933	4.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	volume. I'm not going to focus	574.533	3.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	on volume today, but that's	575.4	3.4
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	another thing that people will	576.666	3.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	look at when they're talking	577.733	3.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	about technical analysis.	578.9	4.566
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Another thing they look at is	580.733	4.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	they'll talk about indicators,	581.733	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and there's a lot of different	583.566	4.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	indicators out there and you may	585.766	3.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	have heard of some of them	586.833	4.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Bollinger bands. Maybe you've	588.533	6.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	heard of him moving averages or	589.766	6.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	indicators. In there in the most	591.733	6.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving averages are actually	594.7	7.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	indicators that can use you can	596.533	8.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	use to help with the trend. So	598.533	7.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	for today, I'm gonna be using a	602.533	6.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving average to help help you	604.666	6.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	with that trend, but that is how	606.6	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that works. The other indicators	609.6	4.466
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I mentioned bowling Bollinger	612.4	6.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bands moving averages. Maybe a	613.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Mac D or an R s. I But but we're	614.166	9.267
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	probably getting to diminishing	618.633	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	importance here. When we start	621.533	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to get to some of these specific	623.533	4.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	needs, the biggest items trend	624.533	5.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and support and resistance.	626.633	4.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	That's what I want you to	628.566	3.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	remember here. That's the first	629.666	4.767

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and resistance now. You may say	634.533	7.267
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trend and for trend. Let me let	637.733	4.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	me just give you an example.	639.666	4.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Here. I'm going to bring up	641.9	4.533
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Chevron. It's a company you guys	642.7	6.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	all are familiar with. Probably	644.7	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and, uh, I'm gonna do Chevron	646.533	7.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and I'm gonna pull up a longer	649.533	5.3
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	term chart on Chevron. It's good	650.733	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to say a three year chart on	653.7	7.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Chevron. And I'd say What can I	654.933	8.5
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	ask you what Chevron doing? It's	657.733	6.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a well. Chevron has been going	661.533	7.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	up for the past three years.	663.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	More or less right. I mean, it	664.766	8.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	started down here and we're	668.733	6.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	going up here. That's a nice	670.533	9.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	long term upward trend. On	673.666	9.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Chevron. But sometimes you get a	675.6	10.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	different perspective. Let's go	680.533	7.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to nine month graph on Chevron,	683.533	6.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	who I'm gonna take off that that	685.733	7.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	longer term trend I had I'm	687.633	8.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	gonna clear that And now I want	689.666	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	you to just look at Chevron on	693.633	5.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this nine month chart, and we	696.6	4.166
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	started right here. And here we	697.666	4.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	are here in. What would you say	698.833	6.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	about Trevor on? Well you don't	700.866	6.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	really see that long term trend	702.7	6.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	as much do you? It's more of a	705.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	guess. Sideways is kind of the	707.566	5.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	way I view it has been up and	709.666	4.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	down, but more or less. It's	711.533	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	kind of gone almost nowhere over	712.733	5.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the last nine months. No I can	714.533	5.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	do the same thing and I can go	717.4	5.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to three month trend or a three	718.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	month chart, and you can say	719.666	6.134
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	well look of late. Chevron's	722.6	7.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	actually if anything, been going	724.533	11.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	down. Here. In other words. When	725.9	13.533
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	we talk about trend. It's not	730.633	10.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	there. There's not just a trend	736.6	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. There may be different trends,	739.533	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	depending on the time frame.	740.833	8.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Look you could look intraday on	743.533	8.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a stock. And come up with an	745.6	9.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	intraday trend on the stock. But	749.6	8.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	for our purposes for today, What	752.6	6.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I'd say. Is this in general,	755.633	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	when we're talking about trend,	757.7	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	we're focusing more on the	759.566	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	intermediate term. In other	761.533	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	words, we're looking at the	763.7	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trend with the trend has been	764.666	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	over the last several weeks. So	766.633	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	when I say trend without the	769.6	4.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	context of saying the intraday	770.733	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trend or the long term trend,	772.533	7.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	usually when I mean is Looking	774.566	6.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	at the last few weeks, and we'll	777.666	6.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	look at some examples of that.	779.733	6.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Okay so let's let's do that. Let	781.533	7.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	me let me pull up a stock and I	784.533	6.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	want you to just kind of give me	786.633	5.233
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a sense of what you view for the	789.4	4.166
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trend. Now This is a nine month	790.766	4.034
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	graph. Okay Keep aware of the	791.966	4.534
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	time frame. What would we say?	793.666	4.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	The trend? Well I'll tell you	794.9	5.533
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	what I would say on the trend	796.6	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	what I'd say, and sometimes	797.766	5.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	those drawing tools on, think or	800.533	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	swim can help. You can go down	801.7	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	here to this little so you	803.733	5.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	probably can't see that. Let me	806.6	5.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	let me make this up a little.	807.7	7.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Bring this up just a little bit	809.533	7.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bigger here. One quick sec here.	811.766	7.734
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Get that off the bottom of my	815.533	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trip. There we go. I want to	816.833	6.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	make sure you can see that. You	819.6	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	got this little tool right down	821.6	3.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	here the bottom and click on	823.533	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this little diagonal tool. And	824.6	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	sometimes that may Assist you.	825.6	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	You can kind of draw lines on	829.566	5.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that and you can go. This is	830.6	5.966
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	kind of been the trend of late.	833.6	6.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Down We probably call this a	835.533	7.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	downward trend. Now Visually,	836.666	8.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that may be obvious. It may help	840.566	7.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	after I draw that line in there.	842.766	6.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	But visually, you may be able to	845.533	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	look at this and say Yeah, I can	847.666	7.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	see it's been going down. The	849.633	7.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	technical definition of a trend.	851.6	8.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Whether uptrend or downtrend is	855.533	7.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a series of higher highs. And	857.4	9.166
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Higher lows for an uptrend or as	860.533	10.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Sherry said in the chat, lower	863.6	9.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	highs and lower lows. One of the	866.666	8.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	challenges becomes, though, is	870.733	7.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	sometimes it can be a little bit	873.6	7.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	tricky as we're looking at it.	875.733	6.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	What do I mean by that? This is	878.6	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	what I mean by it. When I'm	880.8	5.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	looking at lower highs and lower	882.6	5.166
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	lows on this one, you know this	884.7	5.766
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	one for the most part, adheres	886.633	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to that You can see Here's a	888.4	6.166
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Here's a high Here's a lower	890.566	6.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	high. Here's a lower high.	892.666	5.034
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Here's a you know, Lower high,	894.666	6.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	But what do you do about stuff	896.733	5.233
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	like this? There's a high and	897.8	4.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this high actually seems a	901.533	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	little bit higher. There on	902.066	6.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that. Or here's a low and that	902.7	9.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	loads about the same and that	907.633	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	loads about the same Or, you	908.766	6.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	know, here's a low maybe a	912.533	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	little highlights. In other	913.666	5.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	words, Sometimes there's maybe a	915.533	5.267
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	textbook definition of the trend	917.533	5.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	or downtrend. Lower highs, lower	919.533	4.267
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	lows. Sometimes it can be maybe	920.9	4.666
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a little bit more confusing.	922.8	5.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Let's look at another one that's	923.9	6.533
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	in a downward trend. Coke Maybe	925.666	5.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	not quite as much. It's maybe	928.633	4.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	leveled out a little bit, but	930.533	4.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	for the most part, it's gone	931.633	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	down. What's our trend on this?	932.733	8.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Uh more or less down? I guess I	935.566	7.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	would say. That's Coke, but	937.666	8.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	something that you can use to	941.633	7.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	help you identify the trend, and	943.6	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I alluded to this earlier is to	947.4	6.233
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	use an indicator to help you	949.6	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	identify that trimmed. I'm going	951.6	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to pull up moving averages to	953.733	5.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	help us with that. Okay So what	955.6	6.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I'm gonna do is I'm going to go	957.633	4.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to this little flask up here. If	959.6	4.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	you remember Chemistry class if	961.766	3.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	you ever had that. That looks	962.6	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	like a little flask. You click	963.833	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	on that. And I'm just going to	965.633	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	go over here. I'm gonna start	967.533	4.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	typing in the word simple as I	969.733	2.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	am quite simple because it's	970.566	3.867

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I'm going to double click on	972.7	4.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that and I'm actually going to	974.533	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	double click on it again because	975.7	4.3
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I want to put in two moving	977.533	3.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	averages just to illustrate	979.533	4.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	something. It brings those up	980.1	5.333
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	over here. The default is nine	981.6	5.166
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	days, which is a pretty short	983.633	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	term moving average. I'm going	985.533	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to actually extend that out a	987.4	6.333
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	little bit. To a couple that I	988.566	7.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	often use in class. But those	991.566	5.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	aren't necessarily. You'll see.	993.833	4.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	People use all sorts of	995.766	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	different moving averages.	996.766	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Shorter term moving averages may	998.533	6.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	help you identify shorter term	1000.766	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trends. Hence that nine day But	1002.766	5.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	let me do I'm gonna do something	1005.6	4.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	That's I think still relatively	1006.866	5.567
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	short, but a fairly common	1008.733	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving average. Which is a 20	1009.8	5.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	day moving average. I'm gonna	1012.533	5.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	leave that color on this one	1013.733	5.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	green and I'm going to make it	1015.733	6.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	just a little wider so you can	1017.666	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	see a little better click on OK,	1019.6	5.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and I'm going to modify this	1022.533	5.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	other one as well. I'm going to	1023.733	4.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	click on that gear. I'm going to	1024.766	5.734
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	make that a 50 period moving	1027.766	4.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	average, which is another one	1028.766	4.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that I commonly use of. You'll	1030.6	4.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	see people use all sorts of	1032.666	3.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	different moving averages,	1033.833	4.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	though I'm going to make this	1034.833	4.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	one red just so we can tell the	1036.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	two apart will make that too	1038.533	4.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	with as well. Click on OK and	1039.7	6.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	apply that and voila! I have two	1042.533	6.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving averages on the chart.	1043.6	8.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Now maybe you were wondering,	1046.533	9.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	you know, a little iffy on the	1049.566	8.034
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trend. Sometimes using these	1052.6	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving averages can help you.	1055.633	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Here's our shorter term 20 Day	1057.7	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving average. Here's our more	1059.533	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	, say intermediate term 50 Day	1061.533	5.267
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving average. Where's the	1063.6	4.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock in relation to those	1065.6	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving averages? And what do	1066.9	5.766
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	what What is the slope of those	1067.733	7.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving averages? Ask yourself	1071.7	5.166
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	those two questions. Where's the	1072.766	6.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock? In relationship to the	1075.6	5.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving averages? It's below them	1076.966	5.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. What's the slope of the moving	1079.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	averages? They're both sloping	1080.766	5.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	down. I'm gonna call that as an	1082.666	5.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	easy way to tell that we're in a	1085.533	3.267
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	downtrend without having to	1086.633	5.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	identify individual highs and	1087.866	7.567
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	lows. Okay Now, sometimes a	1088.9	8.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock, maybe say in between	1092.566	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	those two, and it may be a	1095.533	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	little bit more iffy in that	1097.633	4.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	case, but if we're clearly below	1098.666	4.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the moving averages, and those	1100.633	3.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving averages are sloping down	1101.733	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. I'm going to call that a	1103.533	6.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	downtrend. Okay let's look at	1104.566	7.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	maybe another one. Let's look at	1106.666	6.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Amgen. I'm doing Bilad Bear	1109.666	5.134
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	sucks. Dude, we'll do Bear bull	1111.733	5.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. Look at bullish here in a	1113.533	4.433
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	minute here. What's the slope of	1114.9	4.533
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the moving averages there	1117.533	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	sloping down? Okay, let me just	1118.066	8.567
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Clear. That I don't want that	1119.533	9.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	extra Okay, Whatever. What Let's	1122.633	7.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Let's do this. Uh What's the	1126.733	4.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	slope of the moving averages	1128.733	4.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	there sloping downward. Where's	1130.533	4.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the stock in relation to those?	1131.7	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	They're going down. There's your	1133.533	4.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	downward trend, So if you want	1134.633	4.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to scroll through charts quickly	1136.633	4.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	, you can use moving averages to	1137.8	5.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	assist you. You don't have to	1139.6	6.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	let's look at one on maybe the	1141.6	4.666
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	other end of the spectrum,	1143.6	4.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	something that looks a little	1145.766	3.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bit more bullish. I've seen a	1146.366	6.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	lot of bearishness in the market	1148.566	6.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. Look here's a stock that that	1149.533	8.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	is actually right a little bit	1152.533	8.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	below the 20 day, but we're	1154.766	9.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	clearly above The 50 day moving	1157.633	8.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	average. For the most part, this	1161.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	has been trending up. From an	1164.633	5.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	intermediate term standpoint.	1166.666	7.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Use the 50 day moving average	1168.533	8.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	for that. Shorter term. Are we	1169.8	8.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trending up? Maybe not. We're	1174.533	6.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	going to a little bit more	1176.666	5.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	sideways. In fact, let me draw a	1178.533	8.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	couple of lines in here. To help	1180.666	8.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	on that. Um I'm gonna draw two	1182.633	8.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	lines and for that I'm going to	1187.6	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	go to my drawing tools again.	1189.533	4.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Down here. This time. I'm going	1190.766	4.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to go this this drawing tool.	1192.533	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	And I'm just going to draw a	1193.766	7.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	couple of lines here that one	1195.666	6.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	there. Okay? And I'm gonna draw	1197.533	8.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	one right about here. Actually,	1201.533	6.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I'm going to bring that back.	1202.7	7.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Mhm. Now What did I just do? I	1206.533	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	just drew in support and	1208.566	7.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance lines. That's the	1210.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	second major thing that I want	1212.6	7.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to focus on today. We talked	1215.733	5.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	about trend and we'll we'll go	1218.533	5.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	back to trend and just a little	1219.7	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bit, But I want to talk about	1221.7	5.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	support and resistance as well,	1223.766	7.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	because I think those two things	1224.7	8.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	together. Really are the core.	1227.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Of technical analysis. Now why	1231.533	6.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	did I draw this line right here?	1232.866	7.567
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I drew this line right here	1236.4	7.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	because the stock went up to it	1237.833	6.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	several days. I mean, it went up	1240.533	5.233
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	there and then it kind of dipped	1243.533	4.433
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	down a little bit. Then it went	1244.5	6.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	up there and dip down a day. And	1247.4	4.366
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	then it went up there and it	1248.066	5.467
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	couldn't seem to get above that	1250.666	3.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	price. Now when we talk about	1251.866	4.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	support and resistance levels, I	1253.633	6.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	don't want you to get too caught	1254.733	8.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	up. On the exact price. Look, I	1256.666	11.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	draw a line through a line at	1260.7	8.4
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	60-40 and I drew a line at 56 24	1263.6	8.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. I could have easily drawn that	1268.533	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	line at 60 50, probably Okay, I	1269.2	7.333
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	don't have that much precision.	1272.6	6.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Not that accurate on that. It's	1274.566	7.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	an area resistance levels are an	1276.633	7.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	area support levels are an area	1278.8	6.666
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. What is resistance Resistance	1281.666	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	is considered to be a level.	1284.4	5.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	That's above worse stock is that	1285.566	6.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the stock has a target that that	1287.666	6.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this law this area is resisting.	1289.633	6.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	The stock going above some	1292.533	6.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	people may call it a ceiling.	1294.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Okay Works for you better. You	1296.533	7.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	can call it a ceiling. Now, does	1298.733	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	it mean this is forever going to	1301.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	hold right there at this level?	1303.7	5.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	No it doesn't. It doesn't if it	1305.4	6.233
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	very well may break at some	1307.533	8.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	point, But for now, the way I	1309.533	7.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	think of it as this When traders	1311.733	7.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	have looked at this stock and	1315.766	4.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	don't confuse this stock Dow	1317.6	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	with the Dow Jones industrial	1319.533	4.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Average, You're totally separate	1320.733	4.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	things. This is an individual	1322.7	5.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	company. This is a chemical	1323.766	7.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	material company, okay? Here	1325.533	7.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this when the stock when traders	1328.533	7.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	have seen the stock go up to	1331.533	8.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	around $60 or so People have	1333.6	11.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	viewed this as Um. It is	1335.766	10.834
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	expensive. And they've sold it.	1339.7	8.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Oh and when people sell the	1345.533	6.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock, it drives the price down.	1346.7	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Okay That's that's kind of the	1348.533	7.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	theory. I think the most clear	1351.666	6.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	explanation in my mind that of	1353.633	7.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	why resistance is where it is.	1355.766	7.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Okay And on the other hand, this	1358.533	8.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a level of support is a level	1361.533	8.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	below where a stock is. Where	1363.733	7.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	When the stock goes down to it,	1367.533	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	it's stuck seems to get to	1369.766	7.734
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	balance. Some people call it a	1371.7	6.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	floor. It supports the price of	1373.566	8.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the stock. So in this case when	1377.6	5.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the stock has gone down to this	1378.733	8.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	level about this level around 56	1381.666	8.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bucks When the starts going down	1383.533	8.333
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to about that level, it appears	1387.533	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that people have deemed that	1390.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock to be kind of cheap. And	1391.966	7.567
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	more buyers have jumped in. Mhm	1393.6	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Now, whether that's really going	1397.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	through people's minds or not, I	1399.633	5.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	don't know, but it's undeniable	1400.6	5.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. That's what's happened in	1403.533	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	terms of the stock has gone up	1404.733	5.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	when the stock is going to this	1406.533	5.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	level or down when it's gone to	1408.633	3.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this level that support and	1410.533	4.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance and these two	1411.833	6.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	together form what we call kind	1412.7	7.766
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	of a channel and right now. Yeah	1416.4	6.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	we'd say, intermediate term.	1418.533	6.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	This stock is going up. But	1420.566	6.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	there's there are we're kind of	1422.633	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	in this channel will have to	1425.4	7.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	wait and see whether that It is	1427.533	6.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a resistance level that That you	1428.733	8.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	know it bounces off of again. It	1432.6	5.966
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	may break through it. You know,	1434.6	5.966
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	there's a couple other things	1437.566	6.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	about support resistance. I want	1438.666	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to mention one is this Old	1440.666	7.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance is sometimes deemed	1444.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to be new support. In other	1445.666	8.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	words, let's go back in time.	1448.7	6.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Let's let's zoom back here. Okay	1451.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Here is a stock. Here's our	1454.533	4.533
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock going back in time, And at	1455.733	8.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this point, we'd probably say,	1458.533	8.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Oh, $56 is A resistance level.	1459.166	11.4
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Um well, let's go forward to	1464.566	7.3

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	do that again. Let's go forward	1471.966	9.534
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to today. Uh that was what we	1473.4	9.266
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	were looking at before. Um The	1479.533	5.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock eventually came up there	1481.6	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and broke through that the older	1482.766	6.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance we now deemed that to	1484.7	6.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	be a new support doesn't always	1487.7	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	work that way. No there's	1489.666	5.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	nothing 100% about technical	1491.733	5.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	analysis. In fact, I'll tell you	1493.7	5.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	, anecdotally or whatever.	1495.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	There's times when there's times	1497.566	7.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	when I see a beautiful.	1498.866	7.634
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Beautiful technical setup	1503.533	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	support level that seems so	1505.533	4.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	strong in the stock will break	1506.6	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	through it. You know, it	1508.633	6.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	certainly happens. So this has	1510.6	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	been to be an aide as a part of	1512.7	7.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	your overall investing. It's not	1515.6	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	everything okay? Now. There is a	1516.7	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	good question in the chat. I	1520.733	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	want to answer, okay. And that	1522.533	6.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	is Look, I kind of talked about	1524.4	6.166
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this intermediate term trend and	1526.633	6.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	we said this 50 day moving	1529.4	8.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	average. That is, that is are	1530.666	9.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	they related? Well, yes and no.	1533.533	8.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Yeah the and the time frame of	1537.533	6.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the chart. Look, I could go to a	1540.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	year chart and it's not gonna	1542.533	5.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	change. It's not gonna change	1543.7	8.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	anything I can go to three month	1546.533	7.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	chart. And this is still gonna	1547.8	7.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	look this, so we'll just be	1551.8	4.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	looking at the last three months	1553.666	4.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. We'll be cutting off the chart	1555.533	4.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	here. But there's something	1556.7	5.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	important that you need to know.	1558.533	8.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	And that is if I change the	1559.633	8.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	chart. From Daily data. In other	1562.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	words, these are daily candles	1566.7	5.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	here. Each bar represents one	1567.833	5.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	day of time. If I change this	1570.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	chart from daily data to weekly	1571.833	8.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	data These moving average change	1573.666	7.434
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	accordingly. Like right now look	1577.533	6.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	at where the moving averages are	1580.533	5.333
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the third. The 20 period kind of	1581.2	5.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	went up and it kind of flattened	1583.8	5.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	out and maybe even going down.	1585.966	5.567
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Just a smidge right now. This 50	1586.933	6.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	periods going up. Look at this.	1589.533	6.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Let me click this to a three	1591.633	6.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	year weekly charged. And now	1593.666	8.834
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	what do we see? We see the 20	1596.6	8.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	period. Going up and the 50	1598.6	7.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	period going down. Why is that?	1602.6	5.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Why would that change with the	1604.7	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	time frame of the chart? Well,	1606.533	7.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the answer is this. This	1607.766	7.134
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	indicator and this is true. Not	1611.633	4.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	just for moving averages. This	1613.766	5.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	is going to be true for your Mac	1615.0	7.433
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	D or your r s, I or whatever	1616.7	8.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	other indicator Is keyed off of	1619.733	7.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the ink the interval of the	1622.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	chart. In other words, the	1625.666	4.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	weekly So in this case, the 20	1627.633	3.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	day moving even average change	1628.533	5.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to a 20 week moving average	1630.533	4.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	because this is a W here and the	1631.666	5.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	50 period moving averages now at	1633.666	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	50 week moving average same	1635.6	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	thing. Intraday if I go to one	1637.633	5.367
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	day, one minute chart, and I had	1639.666	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a 20 moving average on there, it	1642.4	3.366
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	would be a 20 minute moving	1643.1	4.333
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	average. So just be extra	1644.666	3.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	cautious on that, but whether	1645.866	5.567
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	you choose to use a one year	1647.533	6.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	chart Or a six month chart.	1648.733	6.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Doesn't really matter to me.	1651.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Okay? I'm hoping that answers	1653.766	8.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	your question there. All right.	1654.933	9.5
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Now um, that's supports. That's	1658.533	7.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance. From a horizontal	1662.533	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	perspective. There are other	1664.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	ways of looking at support and	1665.833	7.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance. Okay You can use	1667.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving averages. Sometimes	1672.533	3.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	they'll act as support	1673.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance. In other words,	1674.533	7.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	let's take for example, this 50	1676.533	6.233
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	period moving average. This	1679.533	6.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock went to the movie	1681.633	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Aborigine kind of Looks like it	1682.866	5.834
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	kind of bounced off That movie	1685.766	4.834
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	now average, huh? Bounced off.	1686.733	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	It went to it and kind of	1688.8	6.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bounced off. It sometimes will	1690.7	6.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	deem that as a support level or	1692.633	6.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance level in the case of	1695.6	9.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	something that's going down. Now	1697.733	11.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I could draw a line. A diagonal	1699.6	11.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	line and I at the risk of	1704.7	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Cluttering. I don't want to	1709.533	5.267
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	clutter the chart too much, so	1711.533	8.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I'm gonna clear Off. Those Uh	1712.7	9.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	um. I don't want to affect. I	1714.9	8.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	don't. I don't want to. I don't	1719.7	5.766
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	want to get too much clutter on	1722.666	5.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	there, but But let's do this.	1723.6	9.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Let's go and let me just drop	1725.566	8.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Uh, trend Here and what I think	1728.533	7.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	you're going to notice is And	1733.633	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that may not be. I could may not	1734.6	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	be the perfect trend line I	1736.6	5.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	drew. But you'll notice that the	1738.566	4.467
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trend line almost like Over.	1739.6	7.966
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	It's on top of that moving	1742.566	7.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	average. So the so there you go	1743.133	11.3
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that you know that That could	1747.666	7.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	indeed Do you know that could Um	1750.533	7.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	, you could use either You could	1754.533	5.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	draw a trend or you dry, tight,	1755.7	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Jake Diagonal Trend line.	1757.766	4.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Sometimes that may be more	1759.733	7.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	appropriate. You can draw a Um	1760.633	7.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	You can draw a. You can use the	1762.533	8.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving average and that will do	1767.533	5.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	it as well. Let's do Let me go	1768.666	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	back to an example. We looked at	1771.533	5.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	honey. Honeywell before Oops.	1772.766	8.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Put Take it type in the ticker,	1775.666	6.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	right? Honeywell before and	1776.8	7.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	which moving average right now,	1781.533	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	would you say is more likely to	1782.733	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	be a resistance level? Well	1784.6	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	right now, more lately, it seems	1786.533	4.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	like it's been using that 20	1787.833	5.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	period moving average as a	1789.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance level. Additionally I	1791.566	8.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	could draw in a diagonal line	1793.8	7.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	here. Okay? Alright I could draw	1795.533	11.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	in a diagonal line. So we can do	1800.533	10.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that. Um And Sometimes what	1801.533	12.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	we'll do. Bring up another	1806.8	12.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bullish example. Maybe Let's do	1810.833	10.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	JPMorgan. Okay Um, General Trans	1814.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	were certainly above our	1819.633	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	intermediate term moving	1821.6	8.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	average. Kind of up and down	1822.533	9.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	below the 20 day. So which	1825.633	8.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving averages acting more	1830.633	6.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	support, probably the 50 Day.	1831.733	7.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Bounce here. Bounce here bounce	1834.533	5.567
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	here. The general trend would	1836.766	7.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	say it's probably been going up	1839.533	7.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	potential. Horizontal resistance	1840.2	8.4
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	on this. Do you see that? Let me	1844.533	7.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	draw it in in case you don't see	1846.666	6.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that. Is it possible we could	1848.7	7.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	call that a resistance level?	1851.7	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Yeah we kind of We got pretty	1853.566	6.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	close to it. There bounce their	1856.733	5.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bounce there bounced there. When	1858.633	6.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	you're drawing resistance levels	1860.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and support levels. Typically	1862.666	6.034
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	you want more than one data	1865.533	4.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	point. You wanted to bounce off	1867.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a level a couple of times at	1868.8	6.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	least. Three times, maybe even	1870.6	6.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	would be stronger. The more	1873.533	5.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	times often the stronger that	1875.633	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance level is or the	1877.633	6.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	support level. So there you go.	1878.666	7.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Let me show you this. We could	1882.566	9.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	draw that in. And we could draw	1883.8	16.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	in a Um. A trend line like this.	1886.533	16.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Right? And we come up. On a. We	1892.633	12.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	come up with this horizontal	1900.533	7.367
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	line here and a diagonal line	1902.733	6.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	here Now I'm not gonna get into	1905.633	5.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	price patterns. Today It's	1908.0	6.433
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	another way of doing technical	1909.633	6.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	analysis. It's a more advanced	1911.7	5.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	way of doing it. Technical	1914.533	5.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	analysis, but just as a little	1916.7	4.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	teaser if you will, or a little	1917.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	little foresight on what you	1919.7	8.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	will experience in the future.	1921.733	8.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Um The U price patterns or	1925.4	7.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	sometimes you can see This kind	1928.533	5.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	of view looks almost like a	1931.4	4.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	little triangle here, doesn't	1932.533	5.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	it? In fact, if I wanted to, I	1933.7	4.966
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	could even do this and make it	1935.566	4.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	really look like a triangle. You	1937.666	4.034
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	don't want it normally do this,	1938.766	5.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	but just to bring back maybe bad	1940.633	4.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	memories of a geometry class. We	1941.8	5.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	have a little right triangle	1944.533	3.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	there, right. Uh that's we call	1945.7	6.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this an ascending triangle.	1947.533	6.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Right here. Okay We call that a	1948.533	7.233
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	sitting triangle. Now again. I'm	1952.666	4.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	not going to get into a city	1953.8	4.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	triangles right now. But that's	1955.866	3.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	just an example of there's many	1957.533	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	types of price patterns you may	1958.633	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	look at. And so when people talk	1959.833	7.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	when people talk about price	1962.633	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	patterns, uh, that's an example	1964.533	6.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	of what they're talking about.	1967.533	6.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Trying to decipher. What the	1968.666	7.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock You know it may may or may	1970.7	7.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	not do Going forward Based on	1973.733	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	what the price pattern But for	1976.7	5.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	today, we're focusing on the	1978.666	5.834
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trend in the support and the	1979.833	6.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance. Let's let's just do	1981.866	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a couple more examples and more	1984.6	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	than I want to do, you know,	1986.7	3.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	maybe a practice trade. Oh,	1987.766	10.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	something I should mention.	1989.533	9.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Okay? Is this. When we identify	1990.533	13.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	support levels and resistance	1998.533	6.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	levels. There's it's more than	1999.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	just where the stock may go. We	2003.633	6.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	can. We can read more into that	2005.6	6.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	because If we view a support	2007.533	6.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	level is an area where this	2010.666	5.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock May go downtown would	2011.8	7.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	likely bounce, then it may make	2013.833	7.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	sense to set a stop level. If	2016.7	5.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	we're going to do a stop loss	2019.6	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and remember stop losses aren't	2021.533	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	guaranteed to get you out at the	2022.666	5.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	price but of the stop, but But	2024.533	6.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	it may make sense to set that	2026.533	10.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stop level below a support level	2028.533	10.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. So, for example, So, for	2030.766	10.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	example, where would we? Where	2036.633	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	would one place be that? Some	2038.666	5.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	traders may put a stop loss on	2041.633	4.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this. If they were getting in.	2042.533	5.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I'm just gonna get rid of this	2044.533	7.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	other line here right now. Okay?	2046.666	7.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Just to kind of clear this up.	2048.533	8.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Where may somebody do a stop?	2052.566	5.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Well, there's different places.	2054.733	4.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	You could just do a straight	2056.7	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	percentage Stop. You could say	2057.766	5.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I'm just going to put a stop 10%	2059.533	7.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	below or 8% below the stock	2061.7	8.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	price. Okay, Fair enough, but.	2063.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	You may decide to set that stop	2067.566	9.034
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	loss below. A recent support.	2070.7	7.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Now, maybe. That's the low price	2071.533	9.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	of this little bounce here. The	2076.7	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock went up, bounced off go to	2078.633	5.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the low price, but sometimes we	2080.633	4.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	do that. I'm not gonna do that	2082.6	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	today. We may look at Look, I	2083.833	5.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	said the moving average could be	2085.666	8.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	support. That moving averages at	2087.533	7.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	1 38 68 right now. Okay, That's	2090.4	6.333
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	where the moving averages now	2094.533	4.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	we're probably not going to put	2095.6	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the stop right at the moving	2096.833	11.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	average 1 38 68. But maybe we	2098.733	12.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	would go 3% below that 1 38.68.	2102.533	11.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Times 0.97. I'm using a	2108.566	8.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	calculator by the way. Gives me	2111.533	9.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	an answer of 1 34 51. I	2114.533	13.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	multiplied that moving average	2117.6	15.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	times 510.97. Okay? Um. 0.97	2120.8	16.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Wood is 3% below. That level.	2128.533	11.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Okay, 1 34. 51 I just jotted	2133.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that down on a piece of paper	2137.766	5.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	because I forget it otherwise.	2139.7	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Uh there. That's a That's	2142.266	4.267
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	certainly a place we could put a	2143.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stop like we could also draw	2144.8	8.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	horizontal line. Here. Do that.	2146.633	11.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Potential support. Potential	2150.533	10.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	support here. Possibly older	2153.7	9.066
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance, but certainly when	2158.533	5.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	we got here, we bounced off. It	2161.4	6.233
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bounced off. It bounced off it.	2162.866	8.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Bounced. There we go. And that's	2163.666	9.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	a slightly different level. I	2167.733	8.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	mean, I have two lines in there.	2171.566	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Let me just Get rid of one of	2173.533	8.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	those. So instead of 1 38 68 1	2176.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	38 13 Remember what I said.	2179.4	8.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Don't get too precise on the	2181.766	7.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	exact it's you know, in terms of	2184.533	7.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	our supportable, I call those	2187.6	5.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	both valid support levels can go	2189.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	3% below that remember	2192.4	14.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	multiplied by 30.97. Okay? No.	2192.9	15.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Um. What's uh, where is the so	2200.4	11.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	if we do a trade on this, we	2206.6	6.966
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	could use that as a potential	2208.6	6.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stop level. But 1 34.5 let me	2211.533	8.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	just draw that in here. Just to	2213.666	7.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	kind of give you. Probably close	2214.9	9.566
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	enough that gives our stop put	2219.633	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	would put our stop about there.	2221.7	5.166
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Now. Here's the thing If we're	2224.566	3.134
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	doing a trend trade where we're	2225.533	3.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	taking advantage of this higher	2226.966	5.467
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	hides higher lows. The general	2227.8	5.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trend going up if we were to go	2229.533	5.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	down and go all the way down	2232.533	3.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	here. At that point, we probably	2233.766	3.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	be saying that trend looks like	2234.766	6.834
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	it's breaking. Would you agree	2236.533	7.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	with that? But I think so. And	2237.633	9.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	so that may be a reasonable	2242.4	11.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	level to get out there, okay? Um	2243.733	11.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. And so you could put in a stop	2249.4	7.166
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	on that. How do you would you do	2253.533	3.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that? Well, here's how you do	2255.533	3.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	it. You just simply Well, you	2256.666	4.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	can go to the trade down. And	2257.533	8.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	enter the trade. Um You can	2258.8	13.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Right click. On the chart. Look	2261.533	12.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	on by custom. With stop. There	2265.633	10.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	we go. Now It's gonna default to	2272.633	4.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	100. Shares in that very well	2274.533	4.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	may not be the number of shares	2275.733	5.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that's appropriate for you.	2277.666	3.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Because look, 100 times $122	2278.7	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock. That's a $12,000	2280.9	4.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	purchase. That may be a little	2281.533	7.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	rich for you know your blood, so	2283.8	7.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to speak. That's fine. Maybe we	2286.4	6.266
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	do fewer shares. Okay, I'm gonna	2288.7	7.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	make it 50 shares. We're buying	2290.933	9.6
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	JPMorgan stop. In this example	2292.766	10.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trade. Where was our stuff? Well	2295.8	8.966
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I wrote it down. That's why I	2300.633	7.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	wrote it down. Now Look what	2303.566	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	happened here. It's same. That I	2304.866	6.734
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	happened to click on the chart.	2308.566	4.934
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	I think around the 1 22 level	2310.566	4.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and put it in there. I'm not	2311.7	6.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	buying this. It's not gonna buy	2313.6	8.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	at 1 22 or less that limit work	2316.4	8.166
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. Let me unclip that 1 42. And	2318.633	7.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that's moving around a little	2322.6	13.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bit, but that's my purchase	2324.666	16.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	area. And by stop. Is 1 34.51.	2326.533	15.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	For a stop loss. I'm going to	2336.566	7.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	make that gtc or good til	2340.766	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	canceled. Because if I enter	2342.6	8.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	this right now, Uh and it feels	2344.533	8.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	right away. I don't want my stop	2348.766	5.834
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	to expire the end of the day. If	2350.9	4.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	it's a day order, it would	2352.7	4.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	expire at the end of the day.	2354.7	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	No, I want this to be going on	2355.866	5.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	into the future. So we're gonna	2357.733	5.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	make that good til canceled.	2359.8	6.7
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Yeah Let me let me do this. Let	2361.766	7.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	me let me shrink this down. And	2363.6	7.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	just look now, for some traders	2366.6	7.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	. This may not make sense. This	2369.533	6.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	may not be the trade you want to	2371.533	5.1

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	absolutely could do that. In	2379.533	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that case, we could say I'm not	2381.7	5.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	going to get in now. I'm only	2383.733	6.867

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	In a did in it instead of doing	2402.533	6.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the trade right now, where would	2405.533	7.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	likely get in right now? I could	2406.766	10.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	change this to say this is gonna	2409.533	9.167

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	little variation, because	2427.6	4.066

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	think cell stop. It's going to	2431.766	9.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	get me out if the stock goes	2434.766	8.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	down to a certain level. But	2436.733	7.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	what that the question often is	2441.533	5.133

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	then the stock goes down to 1 36	2459.533	5.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	19 because those stops turn to	2461.4	6.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	market orders there. Okay? But	2463.6	6.166

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	the takeaways. Number one. In	2505.533	4.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	terms of technical analysis.	2506.8	5.733
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	There's a lot of things people	2507.933	6.5
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	can do. But probably the first	2509.666	7.834
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	and foremost thing that people	2512.633	6.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	often look at is the trend of	2514.533	6.0

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trends, but usually we're	2519.533	5.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	talking about more intermediate	2520.633	5.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	level trend in the intermediate	2522.533	4.167

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	investors. Hmm Let me restate	2526.8	8.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that most bullish investors deem	2531.666	5.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	it to be positive for their	2534.533	8.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trading when the trend is going	2535.7	8.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	up. Look for that upward trend.	2537.633	8.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Look for the stock to be going	2542.8	8.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	up recently from left. Too,	2544.7	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	right? Okay That's the common	2545.833	7.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	thing that people and if you're	2551.533	4.167
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	bearish investor, maybe you're	2552.7	4.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	doing a bearish shorting stocks	2553.766	5.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	are doing bearish. Put treasures	2555.8	4.833
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	something like that. Then you	2556.933	6.633
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	may look for the downtrend.	2559.533	7.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	Number two The kind of second	2560.733	7.867
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	thing You're and I'm gonna	2563.666	6.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	breathe yet it don't have to	2567.533	4.2
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	write it all out Support and	2568.7	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance. Look for support	2570.533	4.233
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	levels. You can help use those	2571.833	4.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	support levels to help you	2573.7	4.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	identify Stop levels Look for	2574.866	6.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	rose resistance levels as	2576.7	6.866
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	potential impediments. But keep	2578.6	6.966
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	in mind. There's no perfect	2581.633	7.8
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stocks out there on most stocks	2583.666	7.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	you'll see somewhere. Where	2585.666	7.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	you'll you'll see somewhere	2589.533	5.1
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	where there's maybe some	2591.533	5.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	potential resistance. So you do	2593.533	4.133
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	have to deem how strong that	2594.733	5.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	resistance or support is	2596.766	6.667
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	remember the more bounces. The	2597.766	7.734
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	stock makes off. A certain level	2600.6	6.966
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	probably gives more. Credence to	2603.533	7.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	that is a strong level. There,	2605.6	7.966
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	everybody, okay? All right. I'm	2607.666	9.834
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	hoping that makes sense. Really	2611.6	7.933
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	hoping that makes sense. Um So	2613.666	7.767
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	trained support resistance. And	2617.6	5.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	then there's indicators right	2619.633	4.033
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	you can use. I didn't get into	2621.533	4.9
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	indicators today. Things like	2622.7	5.833

Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	indicator. But today we use that	2626.533	4.967
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	moving average indicator	2628.633	6.0
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	actually to try and help us	2630.533	5.067
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	identify that trend so they can	2631.6	8.966
Z8zi0UHWVeU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zi0UHWVeU	be used for different purposes	2634.733	7.7

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	that I'm having is I'm not being	71.159	4.561

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	aren't you holding these plays you know	278.58	4.619
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	first Green Day with a news Catalyst	281.34	4.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	they should be Longs overnight	283.199	5.161
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	normally they should be but the market	285.9	5.34
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	is telling us otherwise so I listen to	288.36	5.399
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the market I don't listen to assumptions	291.24	5.519
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	from newbies I don't listen to patterns	293.759	5.16
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	that have worked for me years in the	296.759	5.101
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	past or months in the past for whatever	298.919	7.261
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	reason day twos are not working on otcs	301.86	7.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	that said what is working is dip buys	306.18	4.739
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	and this is the beauty of trading this	309.36	3.779
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	is the beauty of preparation	310.919	3.961
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um a lot of people get depressed when	313.139	4.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	their exact formulas like their go-to	314.88	4.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	patterns don't work I don't get	317.639	4.801
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	depressed I adapt I recognize sometimes	319.44	6.479
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a play or a pattern might not be ideal	322.44	5.16
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	or optimal	325.919	5.101
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um in any given Market but therein	327.6	5.52
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	creates new opportunity because a lot of	331.02	5.1
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	people don't adapt a lot of people	333.12	5.7
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um do buy these stocks on you know the	336.12	5.34
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	first Green Day like into the close and	338.82	4.379
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	then they're surprised when they open	341.46	4.019
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	down and then they panic and then they	343.199	5.901
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	create Good Dip buying opportunities so	345.479	6.181
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	fagi today I know it doesn't look like	349.1	4.78
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it had down traded most of the day but	351.66	5.099
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	in the morning you know it it dropped	353.88	5.759
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	basically you know 15 20 percent and	356.759	7.201
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	then it bounced 15 20 25	359.639	6.601
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um and I bought the bounce and I made	363.96	4.92
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	nearly a thousand bucks I laid this play	366.24	4.88
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	out in my watch list	368.88	5.52
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	pre-market how did I know you never know	371.12	5.919
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a hundred percent but guess what it's	374.4	5.46
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the same pattern that CL Envy which was	377.039	4.981
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a big first Green Day winner earlier	379.86	3.779
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	this week	382.02	2.88
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um	383.639	4.921
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	or is it right here uh this was the	384.9	6.0
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	first Green Day and I mean it looks like	388.56	4.859
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it it went up on day two but it really	390.9	5.88
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	didn't it closed here uh right just	393.419	6.84
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	under 11 it gapped down to 10-5 and did	396.78	7.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a morning Panic to 9-5 before spiking to	400.259	6.481
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	12. this doesn't look like much on a	404.34	5.16
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	chart but this is a 25 morning Spike and	406.74	5.28
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	then it did the same thing today too so	409.5	5.18
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	you know you see this little Panic here	412.02	6.36
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	uh from 10-5 down to like literally nine	414.68	5.98
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	six in like five minutes and then	418.38	5.34
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	straight up same thing today from the	420.66	6.479
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	high tens to the nines and then this	423.72	5.819
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	actually went even higher to the 12s so	427.139	6.9
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I'm looking for these panics f-a-g-i not	429.539	7.681
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a good downtrend on the whole day but a	434.039	4.801
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	perfect little morning panic and a	437.22	5.52
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	little 20-25 bounce the only reason why	438.84	5.699
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I made nearly a thousand on that is	442.74	6.12
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	because as I was prepared because of Cl	444.539	7.261
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	Envy because I see what patterns are	448.86	6.3

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	mystery here where people think it's a	462.479	4.381
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	an exact science	464.52	5.459
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um you know it's just not and you have	466.86	5.22
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	to adapt I'll give you a real world	469.979	3.541
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	analogy	472.08	3.54
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um you know this latest trip I've been	473.52	5.04
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	in Bali in Japan and you know it's	475.62	5.28
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	winter time right now but Japan every	478.56	4.979
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	March or April has Sakura season the	480.9	4.859
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	cherry blossoms is beautiful I highly	483.539	3.901
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	encourage you go	485.759	4.681
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um once upon a time I used to plan my	487.44	4.979
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	Japan trips in like December January	490.44	4.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	February like ahead of time and I would	492.419	4.321
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	look at like the Sakura calendar and I	495.06	3.06
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	would say okay this is the week when the	496.74	2.579
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	cherry blossoms are going to be there	498.12	3.359
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the first time I got to Japan and after	499.319	4.021
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	doing this I was like I'm ready I'm here	501.479	4.981
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	where the cherry blossoms and you know	503.34	4.859
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the concierge I was staying at the Ritz	506.46	4.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	in Tokyo fantastic hotel and concierge	508.199	4.321
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	kind of looked at me and like laughed	511.02	3.3
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	and he was like the cherry blossoms were	512.52	4.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	last week I didn't think that the cherry	514.32	4.44
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	blossoms calendar	517.02	4.379
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	updates it makes sense it's based on	518.76	4.98
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	whether it's gonna change but I didn't	521.399	4.681
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	think that way the first time second	523.74	4.14
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	time I nailed it and then I was there	526.08	3.12
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	for cherry blossoms and it was beautiful	527.88	3.959
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the stock market is very similar	529.2	5.28
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um why does the first Green Day not work	531.839	6.06
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I don't know I don't care I just adapt	534.48	6.299
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	if a first Green Day doesn't work I know	537.899	4.741
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	that many people are not going to adapt	540.779	3.961
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	they're going to hold overnight then if	542.64	4.139
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it drops a little they're going to panic	544.74	4.86
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	and that creates opportunity like we saw	546.779	5.101
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	in clnv which I missed because I was	549.6	4.739
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	actually flying the other day but fagi I	551.88	5.22
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	just nailed so also if you ever miss a	554.339	5.94
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	play guess what you can get right back	557.1	4.739
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	on the horse that's the beauty of having	560.279	3.481
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	a hot market like this where there's so	561.839	4.921
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	many different trading opportunities and	563.76	4.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	you could just practice and you can	566.76	3.18
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	practice with paper trading you can	568.38	3.6
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	practice with small size I wouldn't	569.94	4.86
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	encourage you to practice with bake size	571.98	7.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um also OC EA huge huge shorts squeeze I	574.8	6.84
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	even said this pre-market I said you	579.54	4.859
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	know they were spiking on this seemingly	581.64	5.28
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	positive press release but if you looked	584.399	4.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the press release was the exact same	586.92	5.22
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	press release from September or October	589.019	4.561
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I forget which one I think it was	592.14	5.28
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	October actually did I link it and I'm	593.58	5.759
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	sorry I I didn't uh	597.42	4.38
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I didn't link it properly like I have	599.339	4.68
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	typos I have a new laptop waiting for me	601.8	4.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I just literally haven't set it up	604.019	4.26
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um this was trade zero trade zero had	606.42	4.979
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	shares to short did I not link it I	608.279	4.321
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	don't even know what's going on right	611.399	4.021
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	now I'm so exhausted but you know I	612.6	5.4
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	linked it in chat um it's the same press	615.42	4.8
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	release so some people will say Tim if	618.0	3.839
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it's the same press release why did this	620.22	4.739
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	stock Spike from 4 to 26. this is a	621.839	5.341
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	short squeeze ladies and gentlemen	624.959	4.38
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um I often warn about short selling you	627.18	3.839
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	know I used to be like a big short	629.339	3.06
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	seller	631.019	3.481
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um now I'm pretty much a retired short	632.399	5.221
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	seller but I came out of retirement for	634.5	5.519
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	this one because trade zero had shares	637.62	3.839
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	the short this is why I think it's good	640.019	5.161
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	just in case to have a broker that has	641.459	5.761
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	shares available	645.18	4.74
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um you know this was all caused by over	647.22	5.52
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	aggressive shorts when they see the same	649.92	4.44
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	press release and they're like this is	652.74	4.74
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	wrong I apply logic I apply my short	654.36	5.64
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	selling narrow-minded you know pepper	657.48	4.979
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	toxic mentality of this play and they're	660.0	4.86
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	shorting it huge in the five six sevens	662.459	4.32
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	thinking that it deserves to go to the	664.86	4.919
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	fours or even the threes little do they	666.779	5.521
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	know because of their narrow-mindedness	669.779	4.861
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	because of their group think they create	672.3	4.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	this giant squeeze this is very similar	674.64	5.46
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	to a few months ago ilag several of my	676.8	4.92
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	top students who were in these group	680.1	3.299
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	think chat rooms and they don't like me	681.72	4.44
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	calling them out but I got to	683.399	5.641
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um they lost five six seven figures	686.16	5.22
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	shorting ilag which wasn't even a good	689.04	5.4
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	setup they just were like Chinese pump	691.38	5.399
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	shorted and they all squeezed each other	694.44	4.079
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	out even though eventually it did crash	696.779	4.68
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	same thing with Ocea so you know when	698.519	5.281

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	hundred dollars okay I didn't nail this	703.8	3.24
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	at all	705.48	4.32
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um you know I I didn't enter at the	707.04	4.919

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	should have this is not a great trade	711.959	5.761
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	but I called it pretty well in chat	714.0	5.16

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	from the time I'm filming this I said	783.06	3.24
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	you know shorting is too crowded when	784.68	3.659

l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	both will crash since they're up for the	790.68	3.42
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	wrong reasons but pray for the over	792.48	4.68
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	aggressive as they know not the risks	794.1	5.88
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	they take until it's too late	797.16	5.82
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um Sirius ilag Vibes and in case you	799.98	5.7
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	didn't know like this was at 9 42 a.m	802.98	5.7
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	Eastern I said both will crash let's see	805.68	7.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	what lunar did today 9 42 a.m Eastern is	808.68	6.42
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	where was it	813.3	4.039
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	uh like right here	815.1	7.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	uh 9 42 right here lunr was at 77. it	817.339	8.62
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	finished the day at 21. okay it crashed	822.72	6.96
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	73 but yesterday it had a giant squeeze	825.959	8.461
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	yesterday it spiked from 35 to 135. this	829.68	5.52
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	is	834.42	4.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	over crowded Short Selling not because	835.2	6.36
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	lunr is a good example or a good company	838.92	4.2
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	you can see here it's actually a great	841.56	4.2
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	example of a short squeeze in a crash	843.12	7.08
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um so I said both lunr and OCA are going	845.76	9.12
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	to crash Ocea this was at 9 42 A.M	850.2	8.4
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	this was when the stock was right here	854.88	5.42
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	it was like 10ish so I actually	858.6	5.039
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	underestimated how high Ocea would go	860.3	6.46
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	but I was dead on right with lunr and	863.639	7.021
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	again Ocea you know I I shorted it I had	866.76	5.579
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	some small profits but I should have	870.66	3.299
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	been more patient	872.339	4.081
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um this has been my problem lately where	873.959	5.281
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	you know I'm just not being aggressive	876.42	4.74
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	enough and I get it like short selling	879.24	4.56
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	is extra risky I don't want to be more	881.16	4.5
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	aggressive than this you know just even	883.8	3.96
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	taking a position I was just happy that	885.66	4.44
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	trade zero had shares to short	887.76	3.96
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	um but	890.1	3.66
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	I I shouldn't have covered all right	891.72	3.9
l7Ij9R4uHls	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ij9R4uHls	away you know this is also partially	893.76	5.22

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	stock out there. You know,	399.166	4.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	you'll see Walmart you walk into	400.2	5.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	walmart and think I wonder what	402.266	4.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Wal Mart stock is like. And so	404.133	5.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	you investigate you start with	406.033	5.2
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	the individual stock. Okay And	407.233	5.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	none of these stocks I talked	410.1	7.066
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	about today are recommendations	411.333	7.667
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	, but but basically what we call	413.033	7.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	a bottom up analysis. Where we	417.9	4.066
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	starting with the stock and the	419.1	4.933
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	qualities of the stock here.	421.033	4.233
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	What we're gonna do is we're	422.066	4.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	going to do something different	424.133	4.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	. We're going to start with the	425.366	4.567
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	market as a whole. Like I just	427.033	4.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	mentioned okay, and the markets	428.266	6.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	are pretty big thing, isn't it?	430.033	6.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	The market is lot lots,	432.033	8.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Thousands and thousands of	435.166	7.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	stocks in the market. But that	437.1	9.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	market we can break it down.	441.033	8.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	It's like this big funnel, okay	443.033	8.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	can narrow things down. Was the	447.033	5.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	market and then within that	449.166	5.834
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	market, we have sectors and	451.133	6.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	generally well identify, said 11	453.1	7.933
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	sectors out there in the market	455.1	11.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	, and the thing is At times some	458.033	10.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	sectors. Do better than others.	461.133	9.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	And at other times those sectors	467.033	5.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	that are doing bad now or we'll	469.033	5.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	do better in the future. But	470.266	6.834
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	right now we're focusing on	473.033	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	going to focus on Let's find it	475.1	6.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	stronger sectors and within	477.2	7.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	those sectors you may even	480.033	6.067
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	decide, I want to break it down	482.033	6.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	into sub sector or industry	485.033	4.3
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	group. But by the time you get	486.2	5.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	to the bottom of it, you can	488.166	5.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	narrow it down to a specific	489.433	5.667
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	stock the principle. The	492.033	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	principle is, we're going to	493.366	8.734
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	start by looking and identifying	495.2	8.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	the stronger sector. And then	499.033	7.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	look for the stock in that	502.2	7.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	sector, And the reason is this	504.133	10.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Because when a sector is doing	507.033	10.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	well. The stocks within that	510.033	9.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	sector tend to do better. You're	515.033	5.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	swimming against the stream. If	517.166	5.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	you're a stock that's trying to	519.233	7.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	do well in a poorly performing	521.1	7.133
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	sector. That makes sense.	523.033	9.067
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Europe. You've probably seen it	527.033	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	at times. Uh huh. Maybe Think of	528.9	8.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	energy. Maybe that's an obvious	532.2	7.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	example. You know when energy is	534.033	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	doing well, energy stocks tended	537.1	4.933
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	, maybe outperform the whole	540.033	3.133
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	market, and when they're doing	541.033	3.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	poorly, they tend to	542.133	4.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	underperform the overall market	543.266	5.667
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	and I don't want to say it	545.033	5.133
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	doesn't matter which energy	547.2	7.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	stock you get into it. That	549.033	7.233
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	point, but Did it the whole	550.266	7.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	sector is being pulled down,	555.033	5.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	you're gonna have a tough time	556.366	5.567
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	of it. So top down analysis is	558.133	6.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	this. We're trying to identify	560.233	5.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	the stronger areas of the market	562.033	6.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	to invest in before we look at	564.233	6.0

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	this one day's performance this	837.766	5.8

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	day's performance isn't really	841.333	8.367
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	the total the end all and be all	843.666	7.934

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	anything can happen on one day.	849.8	5.766
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	What happened was we had earning	851.7	6.866
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	season kicked off. We had some	853.8	8.766
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	companies released earnings.	855.666	9.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	JPMorgan Um Citigroup. Wells	858.666	7.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Fargo. Well here's JPMorgan can	862.666	5.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	see That's a pretty big	865.666	3.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	rectangle. This is how you	866.733	4.067
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	interpret this page, by the way	867.866	4.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	, is the size of the rectangle	869.666	4.134
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	is kind of the size of the	870.9	4.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	company, so that's a fairly big	872.733	4.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	rectangle. Look at this. This is	873.9	4.966
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	a big rectangle alphabet. That's	875.733	4.167
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	a big rectangle. Here's a pretty	877.666	4.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	big one. Procter and Gamble.	878.966	3.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	These are all big companies.	880.0	5.666
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	You've heard of some of these	881.866	4.434
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	maybe not so much. Let's go to a	882.833	4.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	little smaller, smaller company	885.766	3.067
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	here. Vida Maybe you've heard of	886.4	3.533
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	it. Maybe not, but that's it's a	887.666	4.034
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	smaller rectangles, a smaller	888.933	4.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	company and whether it's red or	890.033	4.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	green is telling you whether	891.8	4.933
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	it's up or down. We could see a	893.066	5.634
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	we have quite a few companies	895.533	4.2
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	that are up right now. But the	896.833	4.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	point is for our top down	898.8	4.233
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	analysis. We're not just going	899.833	5.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	to go with one day's action	902.533	5.167
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	because one day's action one	903.133	7.433
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	day's price performance Doesn't	905.733	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	really tell us about the trend.	907.8	6.866
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	For the trend Trader One day is	910.666	7.067
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	probably more noise. Than	912.733	6.133
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	anything. Therefore what I'm	914.766	6.067
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	going to do is I'm gonna go over	917.833	5.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	here to the right. And word says	918.966	6.6
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Change timeframe. And I'm going	920.933	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	to click on change Timeframe.	924.533	5.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	But I'm going to go to the last	925.666	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	30 days. 30 days is probably a	927.933	6.633
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	better indication of trend here.	929.666	7.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	And I'm going to click on it.	932.666	5.934
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	And it reloads and this looks a	934.666	5.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	little better. Little greener,	937.633	4.267
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	huh? And that's because the	938.7	4.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	market is done fairly well over	940.733	4.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	the last 30 years. But as I	942.0	4.6
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	mentioned before some sectors of	943.7	4.866
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	doing better than others, So,	944.866	5.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	for example, like communications	946.7	6.866
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	is up about 10% energy of about	948.666	7.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	7.5% over last thirties, whereas	950.833	6.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	on the bottom real estates down	953.666	7.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	, Industrials is up, but not	955.766	7.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	much. So the theory is we're	957.666	7.2
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	gonna We're gonna look to invest	960.766	6.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	in those stocks that are in the	963.666	4.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	better performing sectors. It	964.966	5.6
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	doesn't necessarily need to the	966.866	4.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	very top sector. But the better	968.666	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	performing sectors, whereas	970.666	7.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	maybe we'll avoid this now.	971.666	7.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Things change. And so just	975.666	5.2
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	because we invest in	978.666	3.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	communications or energy right	979.733	4.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	now does not guarantee going	980.966	5.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	forward. That's going to be the	982.666	5.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	K. It's going to continue to go	984.666	6.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	well, but the theory is the	986.933	5.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	trend is the trends and we're	988.666	5.134
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	gonna and it's and we're going	990.766	4.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	to stick with that train. Until	992.933	5.633
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	that trend changes. That's the	993.9	9.766
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	kind of the approach of being a	995.733	9.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Uh um trend trader. So we're	999.533	6.433
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	gonna narrow it down. Let's	1003.766	4.167
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	remember these for saying Let's	1004.933	5.667
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	just do communications and	1006.066	6.6
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	energy and maybe infotech,	1008.033	5.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	communications energy. And if we	1010.7	5.866
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	don't see anything here, maybe	1012.766	7.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	we'll go to infotech. Okay So	1013.866	8.767

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	of think is a fairly sensible	1181.8	6.966
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	approach. Is to click on index	1184.666	6.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	and just change that index to S	1186.666	6.367
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	and P 500 that does a couple of	1188.866	6.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	things number one. It narrows it	1191.733	6.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	down to an exchange number two,	1193.133	8.433
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	uh, it it gives us some more	1196.533	8.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	liquid type Stocks liquidity	1198.666	10.967

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	that's the end. It's more likely	1219.666	5.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	for our purposes. I like to kind	1221.666	5.0

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	you're more likely to be	1224.866	5.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	familiar with. Maybe and that's	1226.766	5.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	what going to S and P 500 does	1228.8	5.866
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	that You don't have to do it	1230.766	4.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	that way. There's certainly some	1232.766	4.934
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	great stocks out there. I'm sure	1234.766	4.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	that are not on the S and P 500,	1235.766	4.934
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	but that's what I'm doing today.	1237.8	4.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	But I've knocked that 15,000	1239.666	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	down stocks down to about 500	1240.8	7.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	socks. Mhm So, so that's a quick	1241.9	7.933
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	way. But look, we're not looking	1246.666	5.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	for any of these. This would be	1248.8	4.766
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	a top down analysis if we just	1249.933	5.633
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	looked at any stocks. Here's	1251.766	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	where the top down part when we	1253.666	6.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	already decided That we were	1255.666	6.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	going to be looking at	1258.766	6.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	communication. An energy I'm	1259.866	7.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	going to click on sector.	1262.733	6.167
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Industry and sub industry	1265.666	5.167
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	checked out and now what I can	1267.666	5.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	do is I can say communications	1269.533	6.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	or energy or anything. One	1271.533	8.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	little trick is you can actually	1273.733	6.433
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	select more than one and so I'm	1275.666	8.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	going to hold down the command	1279.666	5.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	key on my keyboard. I'm on a Mac	1280.266	7.3
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	, maybe a little different. I	1283.766	5.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	guess there isn't a command key.	1285.733	5.133
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	On maybe control on the PC. I'm	1287.666	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	not sure And notice. I've	1289.666	8.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	actually Selected and	1290.966	8.6
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Communications. An energy. I've	1294.666	7.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	excluded everything that's not	1297.766	6.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	highlighted here. And we've	1299.666	6.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	knocked it down by another 90%	1302.666	7.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	here, okay from 500 down to	1304.666	10.967

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	would suggest is You off your	1340.733	8.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	comment. There may be a common,	1344.666	7.034
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	I think misperception that the	1346.533	7.033

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	right way to do it. What I would	1357.866	7.767

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	and sometimes looking at	1767.433	4.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	different views on this May help	1769.366	5.2
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	. This is six months. Let's look	1770.633	6.633
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	at three months. Three months. I	1772.366	5.5
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	can kind of maybe see it a	1774.666	5.6
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	little more, and the trend is	1777.366	3.567
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	up. We're above that up,	1777.966	4.3
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	soaping, moving average. And if	1780.366	4.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	you look at the stock, it goes	1781.033	7.233
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	up and pulls back up and back	1782.366	7.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	and up and back and up back and	1785.366	7.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	it's been going up. That's one	1788.366	6.934
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	possibility. Let's look at some	1790.433	7.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	others here just for contrast,	1792.466	7.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	these are other stocks. That are	1795.4	8.866
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	on the list that came down that	1798.233	7.333
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	just came out. Okay Here's Uh,	1800.466	10.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Here's Warner Brothers	1804.366	10.067
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Discovery. Um What do you say	1805.666	10.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	about the trend? Yeah but maybe	1811.366	6.267
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	not right. This is not going to	1814.533	4.933
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	higher highs. Our lows were	1816.666	4.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	actually below the moving	1817.733	8.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	average now. Perhaps some	1819.566	7.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	support in this area. You can	1821.466	8.934
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	draw a trend lines on your by	1826.533	5.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	the way. Perhaps some support	1827.533	6.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	there, but just because there's	1830.5	7.6
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	support there doesn't mean it's	1832.5	6.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	bullish. So that's uh, that's	1834.366	7.734
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	another one. Let's look at some	1838.2	5.766
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	others and see what the kind of	1839.3	9.666
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	thing we're looking for here on	1842.2	7.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	this. Let's go to And notice all	1844.066	6.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	these this. This one is a	1849.066	3.934
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	communications company. It's	1850.133	5.933
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	going to be communications or	1851.133	7.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	energy trends. Yeah I'd say	1853.1	8.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	generally, I mean, if you look	1856.166	6.934
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	at the whole of it, it wasn't	1859.9	6.233
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	going up, but of late do we have	1861.233	7.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	higher highs or Look, there was	1863.2	7.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	a low here's a little bit of a	1866.233	8.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	higher low. Here's a little bit	1869.2	7.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	of a higher low and Hmm. Here's	1871.1	7.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	today. Now we may be looking for	1875.033	4.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	a bounce technically were kind	1877.033	5.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	of right at that moving average	1878.2	7.933
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	on that. Let's go through some	1880.033	7.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	others here. Um We're gonna	1882.133	8.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	change symbol. Here's the	1886.233	8.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	company you just may I have	1888.1	8.866
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	heard of alphabet. Same thing.	1891.133	9.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Okay so when we're looking,	1895.066	6.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	we're looking for the trend.	1897.066	5.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	We're above that moving average	1901.066	3.067
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	. The moving averages sloping	1902.033	5.133
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	up. We're looking for higher	1903.033	7.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	highs. Higher lows, which we've	1904.233	10.167
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	had One concern resistance.	1907.266	9.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Maybe. What would you say? Oops,	1911.033	7.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Let me see if I can get this	1914.5	5.5
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	fairly straight. This isn't a	1917.133	3.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	perfect line, but you may get my	1918.166	6.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	point. We bounced off this	1920.1	8.933
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	level. Here and here. We bounced	1921.2	10.866
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	off this level. Here. So some	1925.233	9.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	traders may say, Look, I'm a	1929.133	8.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	little bit worried about this	1932.166	8.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	resistance holding firm. Some	1935.133	7.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	traders would say Hey, look.	1937.233	6.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Actually let me draw that line a	1941.033	5.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	little bit differently. This is	1942.233	5.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	the general trend we've had This	1944.033	5.3
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	is actually kind of an ascending	1946.9	5.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	triangle we have here with this	1948.2	5.966
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	upward sloping support	1949.433	6.633
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	resistance. We're going to deem	1952.033	5.133
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	this to be likely a bullish	1954.266	5.667
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	breaker, but you may want to	1956.166	5.834
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	wait for the break out on that.	1957.266	8.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	And if you're interested in	1960.033	8.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	breakouts, by the way, I think,	1962.1	9.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	uh, we we've got a class on	1966.9	6.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	breakouts, okay, I think Barb	1968.233	6.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	teaches that class if I'm not	1971.233	5.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	mistaken. And you could wait for	1973.033	7.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	the break up if you want to put	1975.3	7.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	in an order. By the way to buy	1977.9	9.233
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	only if we've breaking broken	1981.033	8.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	above this level. The order we'd	1983.3	7.933
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	be talking about here is of buy	1987.9	5.133
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Stop order. You know Normally	1990.033	5.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	when we're talking about stop	1991.333	5.6
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	wars, I think probably what	1993.133	5.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	comes to your mind. Usually	1995.133	6.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	comes to my mind, at least, is a	1997.033	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	sell stop order, But if you only	1999.033	8.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	want to buy if a stock breaks	2002.033	7.067
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	above a certain level Then you'd	2004.033	7.167
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	use a buy Stop order now. Any	2007.233	5.067
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	stop Order sell stop order by	2009.2	5.733
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	software. It doesn't guarantee	2011.3	5.633
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	it's going to buy it at exactly	2012.4	6.533
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	what that activation price right	2015.033	5.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	with that saying is, oh, if the	2017.033	4.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	stock goes above a certain	2019.033	4.967
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	level, this is for a buy stop.	2020.166	4.4
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Then it's gonna trigger the	2022.033	4.9

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	very unlikely This would fill	2512.7	9.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	immediately. Okay so I can go to	2513.8	9.933

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	be careful because I just messed	2536.033	8.667
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	up my stop which was supposed to	2538.7	7.133

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	with stop orders and no,	2551.7	5.166
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	guarantee, Okay? So there's a	2553.766	7.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	paper trade. There's a paper	2554.933	7.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	trade. On that, but we've looked	2556.966	9.567
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	at we, you know, we looked at	2561.633	9.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	take two. But some of those	2562.866	12.534
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	others were mostly fitting. Uh	2566.633	10.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	the profile. Of the kind of	2571.566	7.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	stock that we were looking for.	2575.5	5.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Was this a close above the hide	2577.5	5.166
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	low day. I think so We go in and	2578.766	5.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	zoom in a little bit more. Just	2581.5	6.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	to make it a little easier.	2583.366	6.234
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Here's the low day. Here's the	2584.633	6.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	close above the high low day, so	2587.7	6.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	that would be another.	2589.7	7.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Possibility I'm sure we just	2591.5	8.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	went through a few. I'm sure	2594.633	8.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	That There would be other	2597.5	7.966
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	potential. Paper trades there	2600.5	7.166
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	for you. Now what did we do	2602.733	6.833
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	today? We talked about top down	2605.566	5.834
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	analysis. This A lot of this	2607.766	5.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	probably is very familiar. If	2609.666	3.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	you've if you've watched our	2611.5	4.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	webcast before, in the sense of	2612.866	5.667
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	finding a trend looking for a	2613.666	6.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	CAHOLD-- but notice how we	2616.5	5.966
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	started it differently. We said	2618.633	6.867
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	we were going to invest in	2621.366	6.2
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	stocks. We're going to do these	2622.566	9.834
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	sample trades in stocks that are	2625.6	8.066
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	part of A sector that has been	2627.666	8.734
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	outperforming we actually chose	2632.5	6.066
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	to sectors in this case, but by	2633.766	6.8
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	doing that the theory is that's	2636.5	5.1
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	going to help us ride the	2638.666	5.734
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	momentum of those sectors and	2640.666	5.834
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	hopefully help out those stocks	2641.7	5.966
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	. They're performed. Well when	2644.5	4.966
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	do we get out of trend trades?	2646.6	7.0
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	Well we set a stop loss. On	2647.766	8.634
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	them. And so that's one way we	2649.566	9.834
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	may look to move that stop loss	2653.7	8.7
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	up as we go there, So this was	2656.5	6.5
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	our agenda. Talk about what top	2659.5	5.9
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	down else. This is talk about	2662.5	5.033
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	how to identify stronger sectors	2663.1	6.5

CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	for those or squeeze a screener	2667.633	6.767
CXyQZ57Q-44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXyQZ57Q-44	for those stocks and then enter	2669.7	7.7

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	drop than the previous quarter but it's	821.579	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	not about this we always knew this it	823.92	4.68

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Q4 the guidance for q1 is is at a	3027.42	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	similar level and I appreciated the the	3030.119	4.521
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	granularity of kind of the Delta plan	3032.64	4.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	how are you thinking about you know Peak	3034.64	5.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	free cash flow usage you know is q1 and	3037.44	5.7
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Q4 a good run rate or is there you know	3040.38	5.76
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	some accelerators in there and just 2023	3043.14	5.459
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in general you know is that kind of the	3046.14	5.06
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the peak	3048.599	2.601
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	thanks Greg this is Doug uh so yeah we	3051.359	4.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	guided	3054.42	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um 135 to 145 uh million dollars of	3055.619	6.601
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	negative free cash flow in q1 and so you	3059.64	4.76
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	can see that's just slightly up from Q4	3062.22	5.52
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	uh what we're seeing right now is the	3064.4	5.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	ramp down of the effort on the	3067.74	4.52
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	enhancement period so there's some	3070.02	4.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	reduced spending in that area while at	3072.26	3.819
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the same time we're picking up the	3074.76	4.079
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	spending on the fleet development	3076.079	5.821
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	activities so this is building out a	3078.839	4.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Delta class and the Next Generation	3081.9	3.179
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Mothership so the design work in	3083.579	3.421
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	particular so what you'll see now is	3085.079	3.901
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that starts to ramp and going forward	3087.0	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	there will be some increases because we	3088.98	4.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	have the efforts on the fleet	3091.92	2.82
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	development as well as some	3093.72	3.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	infrastructure to go along with that but	3094.74	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the thing is we do have some	3097.5	4.38
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um some flexibility in how we Pace	3099.96	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	ourselves in this ramp so while it	3101.88	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	increases we can either	3104.88	4.14
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um you know continue to accelerate or	3106.98	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	slow down as we see fit we do see very	3109.02	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	attractive Returns on all of these	3111.96	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Investments so you know we want to lean	3114.0	3.72
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	into these opportunities as much as we	3115.98	4.379
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	can but we do have the opportunity to	3117.72	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	slow the pace if we need to to preserve	3120.359	4.621
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	cash or something like that but we do	3122.76	4.079
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	see attractive returns want to invest in	3124.98	3.24
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	those things because we think it'll	3126.839	3.841
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	generate great economic benefits for the	3128.22	4.32
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	shareholders so with with all the moving	3130.68	4.439
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Parts between the fleet and the	3132.54	4.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	infrastructure it's a little hard to put	3135.119	5.281
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	a number on the exact Peak spend but I	3136.8	5.539
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	wanted to give you kind of a directional	3140.4	5.699
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	guidance there on what to expect	3142.339	5.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	appreciate that and you know in the	3146.099	4.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	prepared remarks you mentioned regular	3148.319	5.341
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	intervals you know I I guess how far out	3150.359	5.821
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in advance do you plan missions and when	3153.66	3.899
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you think about that first commercial	3156.18	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	flight in Q2 can you reach kind of that	3157.559	6.241
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	one flight a month right away or is	3161.4	4.919
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	there kind of a learning curve or ranted	3163.8	4.259
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to generating that kind of regular	3166.319	3.481
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	interval	3168.059	3.3
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	hey Greg it's Michael	3169.8	6.059
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um I you know I think I would be kind to	3171.359	6.361
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	our space line technical operations	3175.859	4.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	teams to let them get a couple flights	3177.72	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	under their belt just to kind of work	3180.24	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	out the Kinks there but in in speaking	3181.74	6.24
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	with that group uh very capable we see a	3184.26	6.42
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	path to be on a monthly Cadence in	3187.98	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	reasonable short order so you know give	3190.68	3.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	yourselves two or three to kind of work	3193.02	4.559
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that out but there's there's nothing	3194.46	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	kind of	3197.579	5.161
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um specifically in our way of being at a	3198.96	5.159
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	monthly Cadence I think it's just kind	3202.74	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	of shaking out the operation and	3204.119	4.621
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	learning how to turn the ship on a	3206.7	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	consistent basis so we have our plans in	3208.74	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	place we're rehearsing them now actually	3211.2	3.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	now that we've got those shifts together	3212.76	4.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	so you know a few flights to kind of	3214.64	5.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	check it out and we should be on that	3217.44	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Target	3220.2	3.899
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and then just one last one for me I mean	3221.88	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	I don't think you mentioned imagine at	3224.099	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	all in the script any update there or	3226.98	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	how you're kind of thinking about that	3229.319	3.481
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	spaceship	3231.0	4.079
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	yeah same same as where we were last	3232.8	3.66
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	call so	3235.079	3.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um I've specifically directed all of our	3236.46	5.399
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	team members on two primary groups of	3238.619	6.541
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	work right first is uh leveraging Eve	3241.859	4.621
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	our Mothership that just made back to	3245.16	3.899
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Spaceport America uh with unity and	3246.48	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	let's just start hitting regular flights	3249.059	5.28
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to space uh do so safely do so	3251.52	5.4
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	exquisitely and create incredible	3254.339	5.161
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	experiences for people I think that's	3256.92	4.679
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	going to be very powerful in showcasing	3259.5	3.72
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to the world the power of this product	3261.599	4.681
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	so that's priority one priority two is	3263.22	5.46
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	uh the work that's going to create the	3266.28	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	value drivers for the company and that's	3268.68	3.659
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	getting a production vehicle that has	3270.24	4.379
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	relatively low variable cost so that we	3272.339	4.861
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	can bring money to the bottom line uh	3274.619	5.161
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that's the Delta class spaceship and the	3277.2	5.159
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Next Generation Mothership and I've	3279.78	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	moved everybody in the organization uh	3282.359	4.081
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and support teams onto those priorities	3284.88	3.959
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	so that leaves imagine and I'll call it	3286.44	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	an idle capacity right now and it's okay	3288.839	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	there we're going to make sure we have	3291.42	6.12
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	both of those aforementioned scopes of	3294.059	6.901
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	work just dialed in and well in hand and	3297.54	4.799
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	when that happens we'll come pick up	3300.96	3.659
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	imagine and see where we want to go but	3302.339	3.961
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	for now we're leaving it in idle	3304.619	3.181
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	capacity	3306.3	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	cool thank you	3307.8	4.799

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	contemplating that also as we as we look	3333.18	6.36
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	forward longer term is 400 flights per	3337.02	5.7
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	space port the right parameter still as	3339.54	6.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you as you scale and then as you think	3342.72	5.879

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	not sure I caught on the customer topic	3357.3	3.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we're more interested in what our	3359.46	3.24
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	astronaut experience will be as we start	3361.14	5.3
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	off or more long term	3362.7	3.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	customer lifetime value and optimizing	3366.54	5.279
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the membership once it once the	3369.18	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	customer's experienced it but but both	3371.819	5.401
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	topics are great thank you I got it okay	3374.4	6.36
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	no thank you um as as you well know we	3377.22	5.58
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	have an incredible group of what we call	3380.76	4.559
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Future astronauts uh we'll be bringing	3382.8	4.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	more and more of those people in their	3385.319	5.52
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	uh very interesting people and very	3387.0	6.42
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	passionate people about what we do	3390.839	4.621
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um in the notion of customer lifetime	3393.42	5.399
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	value we're starting the journey with uh	3395.46	5.58
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	these folks you know some in many many	3398.819	5.221
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	years but our our plan for anyone we	3401.04	5.34
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	bring in will be a two to three year	3404.04	5.88
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Journey very specifically building to	3406.38	5.64
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the moment of the space flight so that	3409.92	4.439
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we can anchor that memory in and there	3412.02	4.799
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in addition to just paying off the	3414.359	4.801
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	effort and delivering on the product	3416.819	4.621
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	I think that experience is going to be	3419.16	5.159
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	so compelling that these folks become	3421.44	6.0
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	are by far strongest Advocates not only	3424.319	6.121
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in recommending to other people to come	3427.44	4.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	but I think we'll be wanting to come	3430.44	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	back and fly with us again in other	3432.3	5.34
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	places I'll jump to International for a	3434.88	4.32
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	minute and then come back to the 400	3437.64	5.939
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	flights the notion of flying you know	3439.2	6.18
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	everybody who's gone has kind of come up	3443.579	4.321
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and said I would like to go again you	3445.38	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	know to a person that's gone with us so	3447.9	3.719
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	I think that is going to continue I	3450.0	3.119
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	think people want to bring friends and	3451.619	3.601
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	family along the way and that can happen	3453.119	4.681
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in the same location I think it will	3455.22	4.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	also be very powerful to see other parts	3457.8	5.34
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	of the Earth from space you've often	3459.9	4.919
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	heard us talk about wouldn't it be	3463.14	3.36
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	amazing to look down over the boot of	3464.819	3.961
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Italy or Over the Sea of Japan or other	3466.5	5.64
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	places so that International Spaceport	3468.78	5.76
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	concept is uh very important and strong	3472.14	4.919
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	for us which is why we're building a	3474.54	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	factory in Phoenix that can continue to	3477.059	4.441
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	produce spaceships not only for	3479.64	3.6
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Spaceport America but they can continue	3481.5	4.619
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to populate additional spaceports so	3483.24	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we've always said that's you know	3486.119	3.901
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	probably a four to five year exercise to	3487.26	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	be into a new Spaceport I guess probably	3490.02	5.76
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	closer to five and we thought we would	3492.24	6.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	be going back and reaching out to	3495.78	4.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	interested countries in that regard	3498.72	3.72
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	around the time we're coming back to	3500.52	4.14
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	flight so I think that that existing	3502.44	4.32
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	strategy still holds today	3504.66	4.919
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the 400 flights per year for Spaceport	3506.76	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	is a very important planning parameter	3509.579	4.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	for us we're building our capacity	3511.8	4.319
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	across all the different parts of our	3513.96	5.639
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	business around that objective uh we	3516.119	5.281
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	could do more or we could do less right	3519.599	3.361
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we're generally saying let's go out on	3521.4	4.199
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	daily flights and realizing that weather	3522.96	5.159
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	won't always cooperate with us as it did	3525.599	4.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in this last week you know it took us a	3528.119	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	few days to get out of Mojave with our	3529.799	3.481
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Mothership due to the weather in	3532.079	2.76
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	California	3533.28	3.539
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um we also want the ability to fly more	3534.839	3.841
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	than once a day at a particular	3536.819	4.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Spaceport so once we have that capacity	3538.68	4.919
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in mind you know conceivably we can do	3541.619	3.72
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	more than 400 flights at a specific	3543.599	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Spaceport but I think we'll probably	3545.339	4.321
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	First Look to leverage multiple	3547.559	4.081
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	locations in other parts of the world	3549.66	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	but we do have that flexibility to go	3551.64	5.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	higher if we so chose	3554.16	3.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	okay last question on the Delta class	3557.94	3.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	production which is very important for	3560.04	4.14
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	scaling what are the Milestones or or	3561.78	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	critical points we should think about	3564.18	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and on the r d spend growth over the	3566.4	4.679
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	next few years are there things we	3569.22	3.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	should be aware of thank you best	3571.079	3.361
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	regards	3572.76	4.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	uh thanks Oliver so just um you know a	3574.44	5.58
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	little bit more color on the Milestones	3577.5	4.619
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	around the Delta class as an example so	3580.02	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	this year uh we'll be completing designs	3582.119	5.521
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	after the ship and actually building the	3584.64	5.58
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	tooling uh for the parts and we will be	3587.64	4.979
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	starting Parts fabrication now the parts	3590.22	6.18
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we'll be doing in 2023 are the kind of	3592.619	7.621
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	big longer lead Outer Outer mold line	3596.4	6.36
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	which is already consistent uh part so	3600.24	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that would be in the fuselage the skins	3602.76	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	for the spaceship itself the	3605.46	4.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	foundational parts of the wing the parts	3607.38	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	of our feather assembly so those will	3609.72	4.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	actually start this year later in the	3611.46	4.139
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	year because we're still putting the	3613.98	3.66
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	designs uh and locking those down but	3615.599	3.901
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	those will actually start after we build	3617.64	3.9
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the tooling and then get that Parts tab	3619.5	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	going in 2024 you'll see Parts	3621.54	6.12
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	fabrication continue but will then start	3624.72	7.079
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the Assembly of the ships in 2024 and	3627.66	6.3
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that then wraps up so that when we get	3631.799	5.341
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	into 2 2025 we're doing first ground and	3633.96	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	then flight testing on the vehicles so	3637.14	4.199
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	those are are the details that are going	3639.18	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	through there we've got our supply chain	3641.339	3.24
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Partners	3643.26	3.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um signed on and already working with us	3644.579	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in this regard	3646.74	3.839
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um but you'll want to you know as we	3648.599	3.541
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	keep coming back quarter after quarter	3650.579	3.72
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	uh all right how those designs	3652.14	3.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	progressing right when are you starting	3654.299	3.06
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the tooling on that it's Parts	3655.98	3.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	fabrication still looking uh kind of at	3657.359	4.921
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the tail into 23. those will be	3659.76	5.099
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Milestones that will be checkpoints for	3662.28	4.14
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	making sure that we're continuing on the	3664.859	5.841
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	path to commercial service in 26.	3666.42	4.28
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	thank you just lastly on that r d	3673.559	3.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	question anything we should know for the	3675.48	4.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	modeling and also um it um it goes to	3677.099	5.161
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	capex is that correct from an operating	3680.28	5.18
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	expense over time	3682.26	3.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	yeah hi Oliver this is Doug	3685.619	5.821
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um yeah so we are in the design phase	3688.02	5.64
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	now so you'll see non-recurring	3691.44	4.379
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	engineering costs as we developed the	3693.66	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	first article and you know then we'll be	3695.819	4.861
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	investing in the tooling and the parts	3698.88	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	fabrication so you'll see the spending	3700.68	6.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	ramp up there it does shift over to	3702.9	7.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	capex once we reach a certain stage of	3707.52	5.579
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the uh you know finalization of the	3710.76	4.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	design and then we'll do the accounting	3713.099	5.041
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	adjustment to switch over to cap X	3715.5	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you'll see a change there in terms of	3718.14	5.179
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the magnitude of it you know we've got	3720.42	6.3
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	two two main suppliers helping us with	3723.319	5.681
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the Delta class and the way we've set up	3726.72	4.619
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	these contracts is it's a set of task	3729.0	4.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	orders that are under development we're	3731.339	3.841
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	doing you know what people would refer	3733.26	3.359
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to as a rapid aircraft development	3735.18	4.439
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	program where we do a lot of uh steps in	3736.619	5.161
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in parallel so we're doing things	3739.619	5.581
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	concurrently so we develop each of these	3741.78	5.579
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um cost estimates for the subsequent	3745.2	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	task orders as we go and we we have the	3747.359	5.101
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	model of course but it wouldn't be in	3750.18	4.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	our best interest to put those numbers	3752.46	3.24
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	out there right now because they're	3754.38	3.0
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	still under negotiation with our major	3755.7	3.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	suppliers so hopefully you can	3757.38	3.6
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	understand that	3759.24	3.24
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	foreign	3760.98	4.74

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Dutchman with wolf research please go	3772.92	5.179
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	ahead	3775.799	2.3
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	hey guys how are you this evening	3778.2	5.52
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we're great hi I'm Mike uh	3781.319	5.28
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	hi there uh just a quick question so	3783.72	6.139
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	first on head count where did head count	3786.599	6.841
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	arrive at the end of the year and uh	3789.859	5.141
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	secondly with that how are you all	3793.44	3.419
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	thinking about the pace of hiring in the	3795.0	4.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	next year	3796.859	2.361
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um headcount we ended last year talking	3801.72	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to Doug here is I didn't have that one	3804.599	3.841
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in my fingers I thought 1100 1200 or so	3806.16	5.639
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	on a headcount basis for the company and	3808.44	4.619
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you know we'll we'll do a quick double	3811.799	2.52
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	check on that one but I think that's	3813.059	2.221
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	about right	3814.319	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and uh last year was definitely a growth	3815.28	5.339
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	year for us in adding headcount as we	3818.339	5.401
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	ramped up our team uh we have a few	3820.619	6.24
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	places left to continue to build so	3823.74	5.46
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we're still in somewhat of a growth mode	3826.859	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	but we've hired the majority of the	3829.2	5.099
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	people and the roles that we need uh to	3831.359	5.101
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	carry us both in commercial operations	3834.299	4.921
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and on the development path kind of our	3836.46	4.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	programs in Engineering in developing	3839.22	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	these new ships now our partners right	3841.26	4.859
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	they'll be you know building up their	3844.14	4.439
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	teams or reallocating folks from some of	3846.119	3.421
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the larger companies we'll be	3848.579	3.24
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	reallocating as our work starts to flow	3849.54	3.24
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to them	3851.819	3.421
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and that will happen but what we're also	3852.78	4.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	able to do is now is we're finished the	3855.24	5.579
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	work on our enhancement program with Eve	3857.46	6.06
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in particular we're able to redeploy the	3860.819	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	talent that had been occupied on those	3863.52	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	efforts into our operating areas so both	3865.799	6.06
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	into our uh Baseline technical	3868.74	5.819
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	operations in New Mexico but also into	3871.859	4.921
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	helping as we get into final assembly in	3874.559	5.641
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Phoenix so I'd say modest uh growth in a	3876.78	5.72
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	few targeted areas mostly engineering	3880.2	4.76
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	when we get into	3882.5	6.819
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the 2024 period in Phoenix and we really	3884.96	7.839
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	start our assembly processes there that	3889.319	5.941
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	particular site will ramp up further as	3892.799	6.06
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we go but for 23 modest growth	3895.26	6.539
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	one other thing I can add um there is	3898.859	4.681
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that with the head count we did have a	3901.799	3.481
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	lot of contractors here during the	3903.54	3.66
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	enhancement period so	3905.28	4.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um as that has completed we've ramped	3907.2	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	down that that head count and so now	3909.54	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you're seeing us add more permanent head	3912.18	3.899
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	count for the next phase which is the	3913.98	4.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	fleet development so it's not a net ad	3916.079	5.701
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	of heads with the numbers we gave you	3918.66	5.639
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	but um those are the those are the	3921.78	4.019
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	full-time equivalents that will be here	3924.299	5.241
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	while we ramp down the contractors	3925.799	3.741
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	thank you and then one	3930.059	3.141
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	one future astronaut pipeline sorry if I	3934.5	4.14
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	may have missed this in the commentary	3936.96	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	but are you able to size that pipeline	3938.64	5.459
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	at the moment and do you all get as	3941.46	5.28
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	granular as the geographical spread of	3944.099	5.641
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the customer pipeline	3946.74	7.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	well a couple ways on that so the you	3949.74	7.379
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	know Tam if you will on on this industry	3954.0	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	is obviously one that's being built	3957.119	4.081
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	because the industry is being built a	3958.98	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	couple of your you know counterparts	3961.2	4.919
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	have uh done some good research I think	3963.42	4.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	into assessing that market and you know	3966.119	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	kind of leave those Works to stand on	3968.22	3.18
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	their own	3970.559	3.121
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	but we're obviously building this up as	3971.4	4.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we go the	3973.68	4.32
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um you mentioned International on our	3976.14	4.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	customers we have uh astronauts from	3978.0	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	over 62 different countries or I think	3980.94	4.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	62 maybe 63 now uh different countries	3983.04	5.34
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	across the world uh so we we obviously	3985.74	5.46
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	track our existing base there and note	3988.38	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we know where we have you know kind of	3991.2	4.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Greater and lesser momentum so that	3993.48	3.839
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	brings us to then as we consider	3995.88	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	International spaceports uh Europe is a	3997.319	5.52
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	logical place for us Middle East is a	4000.5	4.859
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	logical place for us Asia is a logical	4002.839	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	place for us I feel pretty good about	4005.359	4.921
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Spaceport America for North America you	4007.819	4.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	know right now and you know right there	4010.28	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	kind of gives you the where we think the	4012.2	3.379
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	big markets	4014.24	6.0
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	are aggregated and obviously the groups	4015.579	6.28
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that we're bringing in	4020.24	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um do travel and are are willing to	4021.859	3.781
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	travel to different parts of the world	4024.26	4.079
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	so I do think we can bring a global	4025.64	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	audience to any of our individual sites	4028.339	3.72
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that we'll eventually have but I think	4030.2	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	it's helpful to be located in proximity	4032.059	5.421
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to large markets as well	4034.16	3.32
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	great thank you very much both	4038.359	3.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	thank you Emily	4044.24	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the next question comes from Michael	4046.039	5.701
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	leshock with Key Bank Capital markets	4048.74	5.94
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	please go ahead	4051.74	5.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	hey good afternoon	4054.68	2.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	welcome Michael	4057.559	2.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um so	4058.819	3.181
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	first question I I appreciate the	4059.599	4.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Milestones you laid out for the Delta	4062.0	2.94
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	class	4063.859	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um I I wanted to ask on which Milestone	4064.94	6.599
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	or which year that you laid out do you	4067.819	6.72
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	expect to be the most Capital intensive	4071.539	5.701
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um so whatever that Peak burn rate is	4074.539	4.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and I know there are a lot of moving	4077.24	3.9
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Parts but I'm just trying to get an idea	4078.92	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	for the duration of that rate or what	4081.14	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	steps would require the larger cash	4083.42	3.619
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	outlays	4085.22	6.899
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	sure uh 24 right 24 you'll see the	4087.039	8.32
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	continuation of Parts fabrication uh the	4092.119	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	assembly is going to be going on not	4095.359	3.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	only at our Phoenix plan for final	4097.219	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	assembly but within our our supply chain	4099.199	6.321
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	partners for uh their major sub-assembly	4102.259	5.401
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	assembly so that's where you're kind of	4105.52	3.88
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	getting getting the the peak	4107.66	3.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	non-recurring Engineering in the peak	4109.4	4.859
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	assembly of initial ships and then as we	4111.14	4.619
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	move those into ground and flight	4114.259	4.201
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	testing that would start to come down we	4115.759	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	would expect	4118.46	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um as Doug mentioned yeah we have some	4119.839	3.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	uh	4122.42	4.279
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	good capability I would say to	4123.679	4.981
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	accelerate or kind of keep the	4126.699	5.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	accelerator down or uh Edge back up on	4128.66	6.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	our Pace as we feel we uh needs to we	4132.259	5.46
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	feel really good about the return on	4135.14	4.38
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	investment of the money that we're	4137.719	4.741
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	putting in and so we would like to go	4139.52	4.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	ahead and get this Fleet built up and	4142.46	3.839
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	start delivering on the experience but	4144.38	3.479
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we have flexibility in that if we need	4146.299	3.721
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to but you know specifically to your	4147.859	4.561
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	question I think 2024 is likely to be	4150.02	4.88
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	our Peak	4152.42	2.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and how far in advance of Delta's first	4155.779	4.861
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Revenue flight do you plan to begin that	4158.66	5.519
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	testing of the Delta ships you said 2025	4160.64	6.059
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	but is that a few months or is that the	4164.179	4.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	better part of the year	4166.699	3.301
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um and how does that compare to the	4168.56	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	length of testing for legacy ships is is	4170.0	4.679
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that the same amount of testing you	4173.12	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	needed for Unity uh for example or can	4174.679	5.281
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you check a lot of those boxes off for	4178.16	3.539
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Delta just given the testing that you've	4179.96	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	already completed on the Legacy Fleet	4181.699	5.881
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	yeah we don't um expect to see something	4184.52	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you know Unity was a very extensive	4187.58	4.38
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	flight test uh because it was breaking	4189.44	5.64
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	new ground almost on every flight uh	4191.96	5.94
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Delta's uh flight tests are going to be	4195.08	6.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	flying similar flight profiles	4197.9	6.839
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um with a outer mold line that's	4201.92	4.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	fundamentally you know the same or very	4204.739	5.341
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	similar to Our Last Ship and but with	4206.78	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	different material properties and and	4210.08	3.3
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	some different handling characteristics	4211.88	4.14
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	inside so the the scope of the flight	4213.38	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	testing	4216.02	3.659
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	is less than what you would see in unity	4217.34	5.359
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	but it is a new vehicle I know I put a	4219.679	5.461
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	parameter probably this early on the	4222.699	4.301
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	team of exactly how many months that	4225.14	5.34
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that will be it's measured in months and	4227.0	6.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and I think the focus of that is just as	4230.48	4.739
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we always do you know a nice sequential	4233.48	4.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	test learn expand the envelope and	4235.219	5.641
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	analyze go forward with that but it is	4238.28	5.399
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	off a much deeper base of knowledge uh	4240.86	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we'll also have many flights under our	4243.679	4.321
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	belt by that time that have also built	4246.08	3.72
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	up our knowledge and we're able to do a	4248.0	5.06
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	lot more modeling right with our Aero	4249.8	5.16
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	aerodynamic models and our flight	4253.06	6.099
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Sciences group that also help you know I	4254.96	5.4
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	could say make that as an efficient	4259.159	3.421
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	process as we can the other thing we can	4260.36	5.64
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	do uh by virtue of having built uh	4262.58	5.34
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	tooling and and getting that	4266.0	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	non-recurring engineering done with the	4267.92	6.299
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	tooling is uh we can have more than one	4270.02	6.12
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	ship embedded into the flight test	4274.219	4.081
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	program so that's something that we're	4276.14	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you know evaluating now is uh being able	4278.3	4.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to kind of work on different points with	4280.76	3.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	multiple ships in the process there	4283.04	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	because it doesn't take us relatively	4284.6	3.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that long	4287.12	4.82
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to do a final assembly on the ship so	4288.46	5.259
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	hopefully that gives you a little bit of	4291.94	4.739
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	color into that process	4293.719	2.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	yeah that's helpful and um lastly for me	4297.38	6.359
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the issuance of shares through your at	4301.06	4.9
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the market program was minimal in the	4303.739	4.021
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	quarter relative to the 100 million and	4305.96	5.6
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	3Q how are you viewing	4307.76	3.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	of any further issuance as we moved	4311.8	6.76
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	through 2023 given the 200 million or so	4315.38	5.779
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	remaining	4318.56	2.599
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	well we have the 200 million as you said	4321.679	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	there for us to utilize and it's always	4324.08	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	a it's based on you know market	4326.659	4.921
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	conditions and we're always watching	4329.0	5.4
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um and trying to optimize and it has to	4331.58	5.4

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	volume and that sort of thing so we'll	4336.98	5.219
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we'll use it appropriately when there's	4339.38	6.319

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um sort of capital spending capex	4369.86	6.6
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	so should should we basically broadly	4373.42	5.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	think that you know cash burn 23 24	4376.46	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	should equate to about a billion dollars	4379.4	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	I mean is that is that the right way to	4381.38	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	think about this	4383.84	5.52
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	uh so um thanks for the question	4386.36	5.16
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um as I mentioned it's it's not	4389.36	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	something we want to put a a total	4391.52	4.679
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	number on just because of the the number	4393.32	5.46
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	of moving Parts in between	4396.199	4.741
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um both the timing and the magnitude of	4398.78	3.419
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the span so I try to give you	4400.94	3.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	directionally what to expect and we did	4402.199	4.801
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	highlight here that it'll be growing	4404.78	5.399
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	most likely into 2024 but there's enough	4407.0	5.82
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	moving Parts in there that it's it's a	4410.179	4.861
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	little difficult to to put a total	4412.82	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	number on it that we want to put out	4415.04	3.659
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	there on a multi-year guidance basis	4416.9	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	just because you've got the Delta class	4418.699	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	plus the motherships plus we have the	4420.86	5.94
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the factory or the manufacturing as well	4423.679	4.921
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	as the Spaceport expansion and the	4426.8	3.3
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	astronaut campus so there's enough	4428.6	4.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	things in there that are all uh lining	4430.1	5.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	up in terms of being ready for service	4432.8	6.12
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	yeah there's a little movement in there	4435.64	6.579
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	I think it's it's be reaching to put a a	4438.92	5.279
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	specific number out there for a two-year	4442.219	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	spend at this point yeah I think part of	4444.199	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	what okay it goes into Doug's spot there	4446.239	4.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	is you know we have flexibility on how	4448.219	3.781
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	many of those things we choose to run	4450.62	3.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	concurrently or not	4452.0	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	okay	4454.4	3.72
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um fair enough and then it's just I mean	4456.08	3.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	are you guys comfortable with just	4458.12	3.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	having I mean we're gonna you're gonna	4459.92	5.06
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	have one shift in operation through 2026	4461.96	5.88
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	I mean is that from from an operational	4464.98	4.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	risk standpoint and sort of	4467.84	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	de-emphasizing imagine it's are you guys	4469.94	6.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	comfortable with with that kind of model	4473.06	3.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	well one we're I'm very excited and	4476.96	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	comfortable with unity and excited to	4479.3	3.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	have the mothership back there so we can	4481.04	3.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	get that going so that's that's just all	4482.78	6.0
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	good news uh second thing is uh we want	4484.58	6.24
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to really get the volume of this up	4488.78	3.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that's that's what we're all in this	4490.82	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	company for is to take you know hundreds	4492.56	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and thousands and you know tens of	4494.84	3.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	thousands eventually people in space is	4496.58	3.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	where we're trying to go to and that	4498.38	3.66
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	requires a production model so that's	4500.06	3.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	why you're seeing as Focus first on	4502.04	4.619
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Unity so that we can just regularly	4503.9	5.58
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	prove out and showcase The Experience uh	4506.659	4.321
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we'll continue to learn technically of	4509.48	2.88
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	course but I think it's really going to	4510.98	3.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	help normalize this to the marketplace	4512.36	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and showcase the power of what we do but	4514.52	5.4
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we really are needing to get Focus to	4517.4	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the production model so that puts	4519.92	4.4
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	imagine as an option value in the middle	4521.84	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and we can turn to it when we've got	4524.32	4.06
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	everything else you know well in hand	4526.76	4.439
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and and humming along as we want to and	4528.38	5.88
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	then come back to imagine but we uh look	4531.199	5.941
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you know here to have our Delta ships uh	4534.26	6.06
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	beginning flight testing in 2025 and	4537.14	5.34
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that's you know a couple years out now	4540.32	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	it's still to come but we're moving well	4542.48	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	ahead on that I think we'll get all of	4545.42	4.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	our learning on Unity so it's helpful to	4546.92	6.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	have imagine uh as that option to go to	4549.62	5.94
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	when we want to go to it but first	4553.46	3.779
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	things first let's deliver our	4555.56	3.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	experience with unity and let's make	4557.239	3.541
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	sure that we're building out the low	4559.04	6.119
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	variable cost production unit in Delta	4560.78	7.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	got it some sounds fair	4565.159	5.221
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um last one I guess or maybe two two	4567.86	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	quick ones is there any FAA	4570.38	4.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	certification uh neither required for	4572.48	4.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the modifications that were made to Eve	4575.06	5.639
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	is that part of the uh the validation	4577.28	5.399
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	right so you know two different things	4580.699	4.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we have a commercial operator's license	4582.679	4.441
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	uh we talked about that I think on the	4585.08	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	last call uh and that's uh good through	4587.12	6.059
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	July of 2024 I think those go on	4590.0	5.699
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	two-year renewals and then	4593.179	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um each of our ship has an experimental	4595.699	4.141
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	airworthy it's airworthiness certificate	4597.739	6.361
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in fact Eve just renewed uh hers and so	4599.84	6.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that's a yearly basis uh we'll go and	4604.1	5.76
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	renew unity's uh later this year	4606.62	6.72
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	okay perfect and uh last one I think the	4609.86	5.339
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	uh customer deposits on the balance	4613.34	3.839
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	sheet uh down a little bit sequentially	4615.199	4.681
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	can you talk to maybe ticketed	4617.179	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	passengers and backlog or any Trends	4619.88	3.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	there	4621.739	2.121
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um I'll I'll just in the general Trends	4624.38	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	so uh we are kind of the same place	4626.54	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	where we've been before we've we have	4628.94	5.88
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	right around 800 or so people uh on	4631.64	5.46
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	board in the future astronaut category	4634.82	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	uh we pulled a hundred of our first	4637.1	5.4
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	thousand seats off uh to use for	4639.86	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	research that we're going to call it	4642.5	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	feather in to the Manifest along the way	4644.78	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and you know we'll start by seeing the	4647.48	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Italians on a research flight you know	4649.76	4.32
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	first up in commercial service and then	4651.44	4.88
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we have a group that we're working with	4654.08	4.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	virtuoso that we've given an allotment	4656.32	4.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	of inventory to so I think my guess is	4658.82	4.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	virtuosa will probably pick up on their	4661.28	4.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	efforts as we move back to space so no	4663.5	6.659
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	real changes in that category we saw on	4666.08	8.159
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	last year 2022 some people of our you	4670.159	5.641
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	know 800 base	4674.239	4.261
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	on drop off wasn't our largest year of	4675.8	4.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	dropping off as you might imagine with	4678.5	4.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	everything in the disruption going on in	4680.48	4.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the economy in the world uh it was a	4682.76	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	little bit higher than some and we	4685.34	4.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	generally backfilled that with what I	4687.38	4.62

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	could be a free cash flow usage of 560	4724.52	3.36
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	million per year	4726.5	4.199
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you know um you guys have a 980 million	4727.88	4.38
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	dollar cash balance so that would only	4730.699	4.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	leave you with 420 Million by your end	4732.26	4.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you know Doug you mentioned that you can	4735.08	4.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	accelerate or slow down Investments to	4737.12	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	preserve cash can you quantify the	4739.28	4.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	flexibility is that in the tens of	4741.62	4.74
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	millions or hundreds of millions	4743.54	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um and maybe I'll stop there and I've	4746.36	5.16
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	got a few follow-ups on that	4748.64	5.519
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	yeah thanks Christine this is Doug uh	4751.52	5.639
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	yeah the ability to flex our spending is	4754.159	5.221
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	actually pretty significant um you know	4757.159	4.921
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	it's it's it's more in the hundreds of	4759.38	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	millions range versus tens	4762.08	4.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um yeah we we'd rather not do that	4764.6	3.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	because we see great Returns on these	4766.28	3.419
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Investments	4768.38	2.88
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um you know and we want to invest in the	4769.699	4.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	vehicles and the expansion because the	4771.26	6.12
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the economics of producing more ships is	4774.08	5.639
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	very attractive right because each copy	4777.38	5.16
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	is relatively inexpensive	4779.719	4.681
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um you know compared to the engineering	4782.54	3.9
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and the work that we do up front so we	4784.4	3.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	want to be able to make these copies get	4786.44	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	those uh economics running so we'd	4787.94	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	rather not slow down but we could if we	4790.46	5.52
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	needed to and spend less on on the	4792.56	4.82
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	infrastructure and the fleet development	4795.98	4.259
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	as needed so it would have some pretty	4797.38	4.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	significant levers there in terms of	4800.239	6.061
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	what we could do if if necessary	4801.92	6.42
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	great and is there a minimum cash	4806.3	4.439
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	balance you're comfortable with	4808.34	3.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um and then also when you think about	4810.739	3.361
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that ramp of those ships are there other	4812.12	3.66
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	creative financing solutions that you	4814.1	3.18
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	can look to so you can continue to	4815.78	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	accelerate uh production without	4817.28	5.399
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um you know compromising you know your	4820.4	5.16
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	your your cash position maybe like	4822.679	6.301
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	secured uh asset financing or anything	4825.56	5.28
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	like that are those available or are	4828.98	3.0
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	these two	4830.84	3.899
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you know our spaceship's still too niche	4831.98	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	for that	4834.739	4.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	yeah sure so on the Min cash now there's	4836.96	3.779
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	not a specific number we put out there	4839.12	3.599
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	but we we do like having a strong	4840.739	3.661
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	balance sheet um for the reasons I	4842.719	2.641
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	mentioned you know we see great	4844.4	2.46
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	opportunities	4845.36	3.42
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um in the Investments we have we want to	4846.86	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	have that flexibility so our preference	4848.78	4.379
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	clearly is to maintain that strength and	4850.94	6.06
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	not let it shrink so uh we will strive	4853.159	6.0
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to to do that but I wouldn't put a	4857.0	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	specific number out there in terms of	4859.159	4.801
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	alternative financing others	4861.44	4.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um there's Equity there's debt we	4863.96	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um and you mentioned some other secured	4866.3	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	methodologies we haven't pursued that at	4868.04	5.28
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	this stage because you know we have the	4871.34	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	980 million we have the flexibility we	4873.32	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	talked about the equity markets have	4875.9	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	been supportive we were able to raise	4878.42	5.22
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	debt um before and we have that	4880.46	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	potential again in the future and would	4883.64	4.14
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	look to that as an alternative but you	4885.5	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	know we can explore other Alternatives	4887.78	5.16
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um if we want to get more creative at	4890.0	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	this stage kind of sticking to the	4892.94	4.32
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	basics	4895.04	4.619
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and if I could squeeze one on Eve I mean	4897.26	4.32
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you've now had two successful test	4899.659	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	flights how is the operating data	4901.58	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	comparing to what you anticipated are	4904.159	4.801
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	there any surprises and is a hundred uh	4906.14	4.559
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	flights before the next major	4908.96	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	maintenance overhaul still where it's	4910.699	5.181
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	tracking	4913.58	6.3
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	so great questions Christine the	4915.88	5.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um just because it's a broad call and	4919.88	3.54
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	people listing in	4921.86	3.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um the we're using the word verification	4923.42	4.14
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	or validation flights uh what we're	4925.34	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	doing here with Eve is not trying to	4927.56	4.679
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	break new ground these are fundamentally	4929.84	5.1
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	regression testing flights so we use	4932.239	6.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	them to gather actual flight data uh we	4934.94	6.239
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	use that to correlate our flight	4938.719	6.121
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Sciences models because we made some	4941.179	5.581
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	structural shifts within the plane right	4944.84	4.76
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	specifically in the center Wing where we	4946.76	6.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	made a heavier and beefier launch pylon	4949.6	5.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	there's there's some different	4953.62	3.82
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	structural strength in that part of the	4955.4	4.759
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	wing and there's some actual small	4957.44	6.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	elements that have changed slightly	4960.159	6.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	kind of profile of the wing in fact if	4963.46	5.38
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you look in one of our slides whatever	4966.199	4.801
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	slide number was where we kind of showed	4968.84	3.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the launch pylon and the horizontal	4971.0	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	stabilizers if you look closely in that	4972.8	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you'll see see a couple small	4975.02	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	protrusions on the Leading Edge of the	4977.36	4.26
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	wing there's same on the back we use	4979.04	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	what we call them an exoskeleton	4981.62	5.64
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	approach to add a be the way that we	4983.54	6.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	would attach the pylon onto the wing and	4987.26	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that created a little bit more material	4990.38	3.0
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in those areas and so what you're seeing	4991.88	3.9
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	on those protrusions are fairings very	4993.38	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	small pharynx so we don't expect those	4995.78	3.959
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to have any impact and we're using these	4997.88	4.38
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	tests as an example to confirm that	4999.739	5.701
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	there's not any material aerodynamic	5002.26	5.58
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	impact to that so those tests have gone	5005.44	5.219
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	very well so far we continue to do them	5007.84	6.96
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	sequentially the next flight we will use	5010.659	6.901
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to kind of continue to expand if we've	5014.8	4.8
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	done regression testing to gather data	5017.56	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we're also looking to ensure that	5019.6	5.76
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	nothing that we did would create an	5022.48	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	opportunity to introduce any flutter	5025.36	4.799
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	characteristics into this area so that	5027.46	4.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we work our way up to that so that's	5030.159	3.481
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	what these first two flights have done	5032.14	3.3
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we'll do another flight and carry it out	5033.64	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to max speed in that regard but we've	5035.44	4.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	been very pleased with the performance	5038.26	4.14
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	of the ship it's correlating as expected	5039.64	4.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we're just going to continue on that	5042.4	3.779
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	process now Pilots said nice things to	5044.32	4.68

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	given the cast that you have on the	5068.739	4.081
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	balance sheet and the and the plans for	5070.54	5.4
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	production through 2026 do you expect	5072.82	6.419
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	that to yield one Delta class of orbital	5075.94	5.64
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	space plane and one next Generation	5079.239	4.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Mothership or do you expect additional	5081.58	3.659
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	units that you should be able to produce	5083.62	5.059
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	with with what you have on hand	5085.239	3.44

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	of we can tag team on this one I'd frame	5091.48	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the start of this Austin with our	5094.179	5.581
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	strategy is to invest a non-recurring	5096.46	5.219
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	engineering work though it's in the	5099.76	3.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	engineering design and in the building	5101.679	5.52
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	of tooling that allows us to build Parts	5103.54	6.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	in an ongoing basis and a final assembly	5107.199	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	infrastructure that allows us to	5110.02	3.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	continue to assemble	5112.179	4.621
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	copies of this production model both of	5113.88	5.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	these production model ships at uh	5116.8	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	relatively quite you know relatively low	5119.38	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	variable cost that's where we'll get the	5121.84	3.6
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	economics that's where we'll drive the	5123.94	2.7
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	margins in the business that's where	5125.44	2.279
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	we'll get to flow through from a	5126.64	3.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	shareholder value standpoint so that's	5127.719	4.621
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the same on both that approach is the	5130.12	4.559
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	same on both the Delta class ships and	5132.34	4.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	our next Generation motherships in both	5134.679	4.261
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	of these uh internally as well as with	5136.54	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	our supply chain Partners we're creating	5138.94	5.04
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the tooling and doing that in kind of	5141.1	4.98
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you know long wear tooling such that we	5143.98	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	can go ahead and continue to create	5146.08	4.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	replica of those as we both build out	5148.06	4.92
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	Spaceport America and then look even	5150.94	4.08
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	further ahead into being able to	5152.98	4.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	continue to populate space ports in	5155.02	4.679
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	other locations in the world so that's	5157.84	4.14
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	been our manufacturing strategy all	5159.699	5.101
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	along so obviously as we get into those	5161.98	5.52
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	ramp up years we'll also be flying ships	5164.8	4.5
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and then you have more income coming in	5167.5	3.84
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	and so that you can kind of balance that	5169.3	5.46
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	on an internal cash generation basis so	5171.34	5.64
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	going forward you know Doug you shared a	5174.76	3.479
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	lot on economics I don't know if you	5176.98	2.48
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	have anything else you'd want to add	5178.239	3.541
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	just regarding	5179.46	4.12
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um you know the cash we have and and	5181.78	5.459
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	then you know the the cost of vehicles	5183.58	6.659
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	um I think it's getting too close to uh	5187.239	5.521
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	quantifying the cost of a spaceship and	5190.239	4.44
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	a Mothership at this stage given what I	5192.76	4.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	mentioned about the negotiations that	5194.679	5.341
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	are ongoing so um I think we would go	5196.96	6.12
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	with Michael's description as as uh the	5200.02	5.82
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	colors gave this hopefully helpful to	5203.08	4.88
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	you	5205.84	2.12
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	okay and	5209.32	2.6
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	built New Mexico by 2026 but just	5213.58	5.639
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	thinking about incremental Revenue	5217.54	3.659
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	opportunities for the company have you	5219.219	5.821

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	training Service uh to to help add to	5227.8	6.419
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	revenue generation just in addition to	5231.82	5.78
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	the actual space flights	5234.219	3.381
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	I think um yeah just so I say the same	5237.639	4.441
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	thing to you that I'm saying to	5241.06	2.579
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	everybody in our team of Virgin Galactic	5242.08	3.36
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	right we're first going to stay focused	5243.639	4.921
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	on flying Unity to space uh with Eve and	5245.44	4.86
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	second on getting our Delta class and	5248.56	4.02
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	next-gen motherships up so that's that	5250.3	4.68
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	is very clearly where we're putting our	5252.58	4.2
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	attention right now and uh being super	5254.98	4.62
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	efficient with our spend as we do it uh	5256.78	5.879
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	so with that said uh I think there's a	5259.6	5.88
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	lot of opportunity uh for you know	5262.659	4.5

Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	flights to space but I do think uh the	5269.8	7.32
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	heaviest bulk of of getting the leverage	5274.36	4.56
Hv10aRuFZjk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv10aRuFZjk	to have additional revenue streams like	5277.12	4.079

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	crypto I got blown out on the downside	623.88	5.04
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and now it's going up and somehow	626.76	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	because it's gone up a lot or it seems	628.92	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to have gone up a lot just like stocks	631.26	4.139
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	off the bottom in 2009	633.18	5.099
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	everybody is afraid to buy it yes there	635.399	5.221
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	will be dips no the market is not going	638.279	3.721
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	straight up	640.62	4.56
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	no it's not going parabolic but the	642.0	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	market is re-raiding itself and going to	645.18	4.94
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	establish a range at much higher levels	647.1	5.58
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	metabyte says Bitcoin or ethereum if you	650.12	4.54
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	could only buy one and hold for five	652.68	4.339
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	years	654.66	2.359
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	ethereum is not going anywhere	659.94	5.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	ethereum is web 3. okay so the answer to	662.459	7.081
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that question for five years is ethereum	665.76	6.3
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the choice between Bitcoin or ethereum	669.54	4.08
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	even though it makes for good	672.06	2.88
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	conversation	673.62	3.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I don't think that's the right way to	674.94	4.74
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	phrase the crypto debate I think the way	676.86	4.8
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to phrase to crypto debate for crypto	679.68	6.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	spring is large cap versus small cap and	681.66	6.72
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	when are we going to like rotate	685.68	4.74
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	when are the rotation points like when	688.38	4.199
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	do we go from Bitcoin to large Capital	690.42	4.979
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	coins to small cap altcoins	692.579	5.161
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that's the new game	695.399	5.341
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	out five years I'd say out three years	697.74	6.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's eth okay iron alien says when the	700.74	4.92
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	fomo starts that's when the pullback	703.74	3.539
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	starts	705.66	3.9
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	yes but I'm not sure we've seen real	707.279	3.841
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	fomo yet	709.56	3.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you know we've seen rallies and then	711.12	3.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	stopping points but we haven't seen	712.8	4.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	anything absurdly emotional yeah it was	714.36	4.979
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	a little emotional over the weekend	717.18	5.7
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right downdrafts are possible but I	719.339	7.081
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	don't think we've seen people go bonkers	722.88	5.28
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	we certainly haven't seen retail go	726.42	3.18
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Bonkers because I think they're too	728.16	3.66
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	afraid to get in and crypto firms are	729.6	4.32
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	still laying people off like it's the	731.82	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	apocalypse people are treating this as a	733.92	4.32
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	bear Market rally	736.26	4.259
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I don't agree I'm sure you'll be shocked	738.24	4.62
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to know that so like I said I've been in	740.519	5.701
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	come get me mode on this market for a	742.86	5.7
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	while and I'm going to just stay in come	746.22	5.04
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	get me mode what is come get me mode uh	748.56	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	come get me mode means	751.26	4.8
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I have a view and the market can turn	753.24	4.74
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	around and prove me wrong and if there's	756.06	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	some huge dip then	757.98	4.979
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that's probably a buying opportunity not	760.32	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	investment advice right people are so	762.959	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	afraid of a repeat of last year every	765.42	3.599
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	down move scares them out of the market	767.459	4.021
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that's Choice that's how pain gets	769.019	4.921
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	created one way the other way is there's	771.48	4.14
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	just no downdraft	773.94	3.36
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and it sits in a range and everybody	775.62	3.719
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	goes oh well I'll have time and you	777.3	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	don't and then when people fomo in	779.339	4.021
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that's when the correction occurs we	781.56	5.339
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	have not seen fomo yet in my opinion	783.36	7.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay let's go to the market update	786.899	5.88
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	crypto equities	790.62	5.459

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	assets under management meaning the	804.24	4.14
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	amount of money that has piled into	806.579	5.101
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	these various crypto trading products	808.38	6.36
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	basically uh investor Invesco coin	811.68	4.74
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	shares is the only one that has	814.74	4.2
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	meaningful assets under management what	816.42	5.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	does that mean nobody is long crypto	818.94	4.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	equities	822.24	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	everybody is like crypto is toxic just	823.32	5.579
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like everything was toxic after 2008	826.74	4.2
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	nobody wanted real estate nobody wanted	828.899	3.721
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	any of these things and then years later	830.94	4.74
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	these things were like gold	832.62	6.659
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	nobody wants crypto and the marginal	835.68	6.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	buyer that comes into both crypto and	839.279	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	especially any crypto connected equities	841.92	3.9
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there's no seller	843.959	4.32
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there's no seller right if there's no	845.82	3.66
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	one is long	848.279	2.821
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there's no one to sell to when	849.48	3.78
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	additional buyers come in so buyers just	851.1	4.979
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	have to keep bidding up prices	853.26	5.94
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Tesla is Tesla a crypto connected Equity	856.079	4.32
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Maybe	859.2	3.12
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay Tesla	860.399	4.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	is a barometer for risk assets it's	862.32	4.86
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	probably better than S P	864.779	5.161
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so Elon like everybody else got re-rated	867.18	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	last year	869.94	5.459
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right Tesla normalized its valuation	871.62	6.959
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now since Tesla has long normalized its	875.399	4.261
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	valuation	878.579	3.661
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Tesla is now a good barometer like are	879.66	4.32
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you long freedom	882.24	3.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you want to buy freedom because that's	883.98	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	what Elon is let's face it Elon Tesla	885.48	5.219
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	his his whole universe	888.42	4.919
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Tesla isn't Tesla I think it's Elon	890.699	4.801
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	stock or Elon coin	893.339	4.86
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now Tesla has just recently created a	895.5	5.459
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	nine top which means there'll be a pause	898.199	4.681
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that could also mean a Tesla could turn	900.959	3.661
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	around and just keep rallying because	902.88	3.959
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you have the nine means you've got the	904.62	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	first part of the trend done and then	906.839	3.481
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	somewhere in there you got it on the	908.88	3.36
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	seven you get some sort of downtick or	910.32	6.06
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	pause and then you can have 13 updates	912.24	5.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	if it keeps going	916.38	4.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	who's bullish Tesla nobody	918.06	5.519
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Tesla could go to 183 because I'm not	920.76	5.04
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	really seeing much resistance in in	923.579	3.661
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Tesla	925.8	3.719
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay s p s p y	927.24	4.2
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	just for laughs	929.519	4.021
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	uh everybody is a pocketly bearish	931.44	4.259
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	stocks there is resistance in the s p at	933.54	5.22
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	410 if s p sat in this range I would be	935.699	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	just fine with that because it's not	938.76	3.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	going to create a drag on crypto or	940.199	3.841
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	crypto equities but if you look over	941.76	4.86
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	here on the right hand corner	944.04	6.419
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	uh there's no sign of a top matter of	946.62	5.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	fact it looks like a fledgling rally has	950.459	5.161
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	started and you could have nine updates	952.44	5.28
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so everyone's like the FED next week if	955.62	3.959
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I had to say that what's the chart say	957.72	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	about the FED next week it's that you	959.579	3.961
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	know s p is probably going to Rally into	961.98	3.479
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the FED correct off what they say and	963.54	4.46
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	then keep going	965.459	2.541
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay unless he goes full hawked hard and	968.519	5.581

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	p going up	978.42	5.219
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now back to crypto equities coinbase has	979.98	5.4
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	gone from setup and is about to head	983.639	3.121
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	into countdown	985.38	3.72
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay Kathy Wood bought this relentlessly	986.76	5.939
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	she took a tax loss in gbtc which I get	989.1	5.039
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it that's what the accountant said but I	992.699	3.121
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	think it's to sell Bitcoin	994.139	4.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	sorry I just think it's stupid she sold	995.82	5.28
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	gbtc which is the equity markets proxy	998.519	3.901
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	for Bitcoin	1001.1	3.659
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and she sold it with Bitcoin at a huge	1002.42	4.2
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	discount probably afraid that one of the	1004.759	3.781
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	parent companies	1006.62	4.44

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	bankruptcies so even though she's	1012.62	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	bullish she's bearish she's bullish and	1014.6	4.14
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Afraid	1017.12	3.42
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you don't get a correction until people	1018.74	5.76
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	are bullish and unafraid to be bullish	1020.54	6.12
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	this is how bottoms work this is the	1024.5	5.579
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	nature of the disbelief phase	1026.66	4.919
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now by the way you might be wondering	1030.079	3.061
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	how I know this	1031.579	3.421
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I know this because I got killed by	1033.14	4.14
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	staying bearish after equities made the	1035.0	4.919
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	bottom in 2009. I did not read this in a	1037.28	3.6
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	book	1039.919	2.76
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I found this out and learned this the	1040.88	3.66
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	hard way and Val this would never happen	1042.679	3.961
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	again ever	1044.54	5.22
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and now that the FTX fud is over and the	1046.64	5.7
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	tax law selling is done crypto is going	1049.76	5.22
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to Simply and plainly re-rate itself	1052.34	5.94
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so is coinbase right my friends are	1054.98	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	calling me going my girlfriend's friends	1058.28	4.86

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	crypto	1065.12	4.32
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	what do you think the 30 000 print in	1066.679	6.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Bitcoin does for retail	1069.44	5.52
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	or a summer rally so this whole idea	1072.679	4.141
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that coinbase can't go up is crazy	1074.96	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	coinbase is at 55.	1076.82	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the first part of the trend as	1079.64	4.2
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	represented by the nine is done there's	1081.26	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	probably already been a pause and you	1083.84	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	can have 13 more updates	1085.76	4.86
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	before you even have to worry about like	1088.28	4.98
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	a major correction	1090.62	4.439
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right Sands the FED doing something	1093.26	3.06
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	stupid	1095.059	2.941
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	but this thing looks like it wants to go	1096.32	5.099
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to 74 and I mean what is the Fed going	1098.0	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to do	1101.419	2.461
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	say we're going to tighten until the	1102.5	3.96
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	price of eggs go down where is it in the	1103.88	4.56
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	economics book that ties interest rates	1106.46	4.02

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's not there	1110.48	3.18
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so they can say what they want but the	1111.919	3.12
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Market's just going to go okay that's	1113.66	3.6
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	nice and keep going particularly as it	1115.039	5.221
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	related to crypto equities	1117.26	4.799
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	hot mining	1120.26	3.84
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	this is a weekly chart	1122.059	5.341
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so uh I don't know it was at like 16 I	1124.1	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	can't even put it on the chart but it	1127.4	4.98
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	went to 78 cents so they annihilated it	1129.2	5.339
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like it was going to zero now it's back	1132.38	3.539
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	at two dollars	1134.539	3.121
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there's resistance at two dollars and	1135.919	3.361
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	when it goes from 78 cents to two	1137.66	3.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	dollars everyone goes well it's up a lot	1139.28	3.84
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I can't buy it no actually it's not up a	1140.9	4.8
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	lot it's up a lot in percentage terms	1143.12	5.7
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	but if Hut goes through 222 on a weekly	1145.7	5.94
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	closing basis you can have six more up	1148.82	4.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	weeks	1151.64	2.52
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	foreign	1153.2	2.76
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now you might get some sort of pause	1154.16	3.6
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	next week around the FED because I'm not	1155.96	3.54
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	an idiot you know the market may go okay	1157.76	4.799
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you know we have to digest this but if	1159.5	4.799
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	they give you a dip in these crypto	1162.559	6.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	stocks like next week right even if that	1164.299	7.861
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	dip is off some scary fed statement	1168.799	5.401
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right I want to go into my Schwab	1172.16	3.72
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	account and I want to be there I want to	1174.2	3.719
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	do it so I can't give you advice because	1175.88	3.9
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you know this is about entertainment and	1177.919	3.12
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	information	1179.78	3.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	but when it comes to crypto equities you	1181.039	4.561
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	have not missed out if anything the next	1183.02	5.64
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	dip could be the last dip before a	1185.6	6.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	multi-month rally in these stocks worst	1188.66	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	case scenario these stocks are going to	1191.84	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	form a range to consolidate in and then	1193.82	4.08
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	by the end of March they're going to be	1196.28	2.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	gone	1197.9	3.96
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like absolutely gone to the upside	1199.1	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Marathon digital a hyper leveraged	1201.86	5.699

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that everybody was afraid was going to	1207.559	3.601
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	blow up	1209.539	4.621
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the stock got completely annihilated	1211.16	5.04
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now you could have eight more updates	1214.16	5.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	before there's a any type of Correction	1216.2	6.06
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and this assumes that any DeMark topping	1219.98	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	signal on this actually creates a	1222.26	5.88
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	correction it probably does	1225.08	5.28
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	but the thing is how high is it going to	1228.14	3.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	go	1230.36	3.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	before that correction occurs	1231.14	5.84
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and if you're too scared to buy it	1233.36	3.62
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's probably got more upside	1237.02	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	this is another Doctrine called fade	1239.6	3.3

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	probably a good trade because you have	1251.36	2.64

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	if you go back to actual technical	1280.7	4.979

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and these stocks are going to reflect	1301.1	4.14

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	more the more dramatic the correction	1317.659	4.02

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and the same thing goes for optimism and	1323.84	4.56
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	all these other big altcoins that have	1326.24	3.6

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	get liquidated if anything Bitcoin goes	1375.08	4.26

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	1605 is a support point this was	1388.84	5.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	adjusted from last night	1392.059	5.281
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so the the support is 1605. if Heath	1394.1	5.819
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	holds above 1605 or if he dips below	1397.34	5.28
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that and there's nothing but fires 1900	1399.919	5.64

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's called Pomo the pain of missing out	1430.1	7.02
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	if portfolio manager a buys a ton of	1434.12	4.2
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	crypto	1437.12	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and portfolio manager B only buys a	1438.32	5.099
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	small amount of crypto because he's	1441.38	3.72
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	afraid of the fud	1443.419	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	D portfolio manager a beats portfolio	1445.1	5.579
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	manager B and portfolio manager b gets	1447.679	4.141
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	fired	1450.679	3.601
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	if anybody lost money last year no one	1451.82	4.92
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	cares that was a Black Swan if crypto is	1454.28	4.86
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	going up and you don't own it and you're	1456.74	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	a portfolio manager you're an idiot	1459.14	5.88
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	or you will be considered an idiot now	1461.84	4.86
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	people have their views they do their	1465.02	2.76
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	research they have their own	1466.7	3.599
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	methodologies I'm not knocking this but	1467.78	4.56
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	if price is going up and portfolio	1470.299	3.841
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	managers don't have it	1472.34	3.66
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's going to go up more and the reason	1474.14	3.659
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there's no downtick is because every	1476.0	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	single it's like as soon as it stops	1477.799	4.981
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	guys start hoovering it up	1480.26	5.22
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so until this like up sideways up	1482.78	6.06
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	sideways stuff stops it's just not going	1485.48	5.819
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to stop going up	1488.84	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	uh ethereum on a wave count so this is	1491.299	5.941
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	d-wave so it's demarcs Elliott wave tool	1494.0	6.78
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so it bottoms at 800 in July 8th goes up	1497.24	6.66
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to 2000 then there's this sort of awful	1500.78	6.12
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	slump off FTX where we have to watch it	1503.9	6.54
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	go you know basically below 1100 as the	1506.9	6.6
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Wave 2 over here and you know it's the	1510.44	5.7
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	end of the world at 1100. it was the	1513.5	5.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Apocalypse Now eat is up only which is	1516.14	5.34
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	exactly what it should be because that's	1519.32	4.979
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	what happens in a wave three wave three	1521.48	4.679
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	provides Traders with huge amounts of	1524.299	4.321
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	gratification because again it's pretty	1526.159	6.481
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	much up only with almost no downticks	1528.62	7.32
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and wave threes usually start out slowly	1532.64	4.98
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and they put people to sleep they're	1535.94	3.839
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like okay it's going up but I don't have	1537.62	4.62
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to do it I can buy a dip	1539.779	5.52
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there's no dip oh I have to get it	1542.24	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and then it really accelerates have we	1545.299	3.901
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	gotten to that point in each absolutely	1547.34	3.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	not	1549.2	3.359
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you don't even talk about that until	1550.58	4.199
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	eighth is above two thousand	1552.559	4.321
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	each probably gonna go to 1900 then	1554.779	3.241
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there's going to be a pause because that	1556.88	3.06
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	was the high of wave one and then as	1558.02	3.48
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	soon as it goes above the high of wave	1559.94	3.719
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	one at 2000 is when people are going to	1561.5	4.799
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	lose their minds and you know	1563.659	4.981
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I'm going to be getting calls from you	1566.299	4.561
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	know my godson in college going how do I	1568.64	3.3
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	fomo in	1570.86	2.34
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	but	1571.94	3.839
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	we are absolutely not there yet	1573.2	4.2
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay near	1575.779	4.981
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so this is layer one web three	1577.4	6.06
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	everyone loved it at 20 hated it 1.25	1580.76	5.159
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now there's a 13 top on the daily chart	1583.46	5.099
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so this is the question does a 13 top	1585.919	5.281
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	produce selling	1588.559	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	or a pause	1591.2	3.359
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	in other words if you get one day of	1593.059	3.661
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	selling and it comes back	1594.559	3.961
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	then you know the market means business	1596.72	3.72
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like DeMark work is great when it works	1598.52	3.779
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and when it doesn't work	1600.44	4.14
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so if there's a 13 top and near and it	1602.299	4.561
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	doesn't go down or it goes down for a	1604.58	4.14
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	day and comes back	1606.86	3.9
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	then just look out	1608.72	4.199
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right just like over here when it was a	1610.76	4.74
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	13 bottom and there was no bottom	1612.919	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	because everybody needed the tax law	1615.5	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	cell and it went from 1.75 to 1.25 and	1617.179	5.701
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	sat down there and made it look like the	1620.6	4.559
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	absolute end of the coin end of the	1622.88	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	world you know and I don't blame anybody	1625.159	4.02
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	when it just crashes all year and then	1627.14	3.539
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it just sits down there	1629.179	4.321
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	which is exactly what happened in 2018	1630.679	4.441
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it looks like the end of the world but	1633.5	3.12
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	what it really is is the bigger the base	1635.12	3.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the higher in the space	1636.62	3.78
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	back to the 13 top over here on the	1638.12	5.28
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right you watch near okay there could be	1640.4	5.159
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	a dip there could be a top	1643.4	3.779
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	but if there's a dip and it comes back	1645.559	4.141
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	then that was your dip	1647.179	3.901
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you don't want to catch the falling	1649.7	2.88
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	knife I understand that	1651.08	3.959
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you wait for a dip if you don't get one	1652.58	4.74
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	then you know that 13 top signal no	1655.039	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	one's paying attention no one cares	1657.32	4.859
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's like okay it's a pause	1659.299	5.581
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	is it a top or is it like this is the	1662.179	4.98

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and then when there's a correction if	1687.679	3.961
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you're getting early enough you might be	1689.659	5.281
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	able to ride out the one month pause	1691.64	5.34
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that way you have trade location and you	1694.94	3.66
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	can just sit there with it or you take	1696.98	4.079
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	your trading profits and you look to	1698.6	5.459
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	grab it on a dip once people have just	1701.059	5.581
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	full mode in like crazy people	1704.059	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	but normally when you have fomo you have	1706.64	4.08
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like a v-top like it goes way higher	1708.559	4.141
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	than anyone thanks	1710.72	4.02
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like it just goes up up up and up	1712.7	3.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	because I still don't think we've seen	1714.74	4.08
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the god candle in any coin yet	1715.94	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	even though Salon has been up a lot	1718.82	3.239
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there has not been the god candle where	1720.44	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	stuff's up 20 in one day	1722.059	4.921
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and I don't think this rally initial	1725.12	3.539
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	rally in January is going to stop until	1726.98	3.96
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you get that God can't	1728.659	5.701
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	well in Bitcoin if it's above 22 800 25k	1730.94	4.979
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	is possible	1734.36	3.419
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay you look at Bitcoin on a daily	1735.919	4.321
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	chart yes there's a 13 top	1737.779	4.321
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's been there for two days does anyone	1740.24	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	seem to care they don't	1742.1	4.319
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there's resistance or there's an	1744.5	5.64
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	inflection point just under 23k Bitcoin	1746.419	5.161
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	is it budget	1750.14	4.019
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so it's sitting there either right below	1751.58	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	or right on top of resistance depending	1754.159	3.241
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	on what happens	1756.02	4.08
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so there's a top no one cares that the	1757.4	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	institution's buying it because to them	1760.1	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	22 000 isn't expensive or they don't	1762.5	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	even care what's expensive they just	1765.2	3.479
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	care that it's an object in motion and	1767.0	3.12
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	if it goes up again and if I don't have	1768.679	3.421
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it I'm fired	1770.12	3.84
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and this can work in your benefit if	1772.1	3.059
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you're a retail investor and you	1773.96	3.839
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	understand how to draw support points in	1775.159	4.321
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	a vertical Market which we show you on	1777.799	3.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the channel so please hit the like	1779.48	2.939
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	button and subscribe	1780.799	3.541
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	this is why Bitcoin is acting like this	1782.419	4.081
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	even though there are topping signals	1784.34	5.939
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay Avalanche support at 17.50 so if we	1786.5	7.62
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	do a Dipsy do okay whatever if it's back	1790.279	7.801
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	above 1750 if the target is 23. polka	1794.12	6.419
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	dot a redrawal on this looks like the	1798.08	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	support is at six dollars and 38 cents	1800.539	4.86
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and the uptight Target is 7.21 and	1802.52	4.56
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	frankly I don't think anybody should it	1805.399	3.061
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	just never should have been below seven	1807.08	3.599
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and the development that's going on this	1808.46	3.54
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	is massive	1810.679	3.12
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	today they pushed a button on this and	1812.0	3.539
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it comes online and interoperability	1813.799	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	becomes real the whole world changes	1815.539	3.901
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and of course it's naturally everybody	1818.059	3.48
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	gave up on that as the developers are	1819.44	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	just building building building building	1821.539	4.74
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Solana which eventually is going to come	1824.12	4.02
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	out with Solana phone in my opinion	1826.279	3.9
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	everyone gave up on this no one everyone	1828.14	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	loved it at 200 they hated it at nine it	1830.179	5.521
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	was dead now they're supported 23 people	1832.82	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	are scared to buy it and it could go to	1835.7	4.8
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	35 and I still think 45 is the ultimate	1837.26	6.019
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	upside Target	1840.5	2.779
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	seriously go back and look at how many	1843.98	4.799
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Solana is Dead videos were made when it	1846.08	4.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	was at Ted	1848.779	3.361
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you know like	1850.46	3.599
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	hedge funds have irresponsibly big	1852.14	5.039
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	positions it was an FTX holding all the	1854.059	6.72
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	tvl is gone the flood was unbelievable	1857.179	5.041
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now they're so embarrassed they can't	1860.779	3.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	even get turned around Peter Schiff is	1862.22	3.72
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so embarrassed about Bitcoin he's like	1863.779	4.14
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	yeah 18K is a great level to get rid of	1865.94	3.719
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	your Bitcoin he's on Twitter trying to	1867.919	3.841
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like save face turn himself around I	1869.659	3.9
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	actually feel bad for the guy	1871.76	3.419
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like when you tell everyone to	1873.559	5.161
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	aggressively sell a a like generational	1875.179	6.6
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	bottom or at least the end of a major	1878.72	4.559
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	bear Market	1881.779	3.421
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	into spring	1883.279	4.02
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that's tough to recover from	1885.2	4.8
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like Kramer telling people that you know	1887.299	4.74
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	18K or this was a good time to get rid	1890.0	4.32
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	of your Bitcoin and it goes up 40 in his	1892.039	3.601
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	face	1894.32	3.359
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you know like what's he gonna do like	1895.64	3.96
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	anytime anybody's if he comes out and	1897.679	3.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	says you know what I was wrong on crypto	1899.6	3.84
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I like it everyone's going to sell	1900.919	5.701
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's awful that's why when you get this	1903.44	4.979
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I've learned that when these bull	1906.62	4.2
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	markets start it's you know F around and	1908.419	4.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	find out you fight these things you get	1910.82	4.859
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	run over and you get run over and so	1912.799	5.221
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	does your reputation	1915.679	4.561
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay optimism there's a lot of	1918.02	4.92
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	resistance at 261 and this brings up the	1920.24	3.96
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	rotation game	1922.94	3.239
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so this is probably going to wind up	1924.2	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	being a monster winner during this	1926.179	4.321
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	crypto spring	1928.88	3.96
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay this summer it's probably going to	1930.5	4.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	be epic the only thing that's	1932.84	4.02
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	interesting about that is that everybody	1934.88	4.74
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	knows it in this particular coin	1936.86	6.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so if support at 207 holds they can take	1939.62	6.299
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it up to 261. interesting that they were	1943.1	5.459
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	too afraid to go up there so it could	1945.919	5.941
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	actually go beyond that if 207 holds	1948.559	5.281
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the thing about optimism and maybe even	1951.86	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	about Solana is if you get God candle	1953.84	4.319
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	type price action it's probably going to	1956.12	4.559
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	come back off but are you there yet no	1958.159	5.941
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	is two dollars or 207 a bad place to get	1960.679	5.161
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	into optimism	1964.1	3.72
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	non-investment advice but based on this	1965.84	4.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	chart the answer would be no	1967.82	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	in other words it's not a bull market	1970.22	3.66
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	until you can buy a dip and make money	1972.26	3.18
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and the only way to figure that out is	1973.88	3.6
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to buy a dip	1975.44	4.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like you have to test it for yourself	1977.48	3.9
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right if you don't believe that this is	1979.82	3.06
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	a bull market I don't blame you you have	1981.38	2.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to prove it to yourself	1982.88	3.899
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like I can bloviate all I want	1984.2	4.92
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I can pound the table but ultimately	1986.779	4.02
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's up to you because you're running	1989.12	3.48
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	your book	1990.799	4.62
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	xrp everyone hated it	1992.6	5.28

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	huge theme we've had this year we've	2137.68	4.02
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	said above 140 it's going to 280.	2139.54	3.84

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	tough particularly in this coin because	2147.46	2.879
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	if it's going to be a freight train to	2148.96	4.56

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	probably going to go straight to 190. so	2153.52	3.96
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	this could be like one of these things	2156.339	2.821

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	water and a pricing mechanism or no	2370.66	4.919
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	water think about it	2373.359	5.281

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	working on grains next	2429.82	3.48
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay if there's going to be a	2431.92	3.54
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	geopolitical shoe drop	2433.3	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	getting long grains in advance would be	2435.46	5.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the way to go	2437.8	2.66
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay somebody wants Ta on the water ETF	2441.339	5.341
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	e b l u	2444.22	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay and then Andre is looking at Aptos	2446.68	6.14
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so let's go to live ta	2449.38	3.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay so Aptos is ballistic right	2460.48	4.7
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	this is kind of like the you know this	2465.339	5.701
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	is what Solana was	2468.28	5.76
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	back in 2021	2471.04	5.34
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	where everyone was like I don't know I	2474.04	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	hate it or I don't understand it and now	2476.38	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's just indiscriminately moaning	2478.54	5.28
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now from my point of view when you look	2481.54	3.6
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	at this I'm going to go to the eight	2483.82	3.6
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	hour chart	2485.14	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so when I look at this I'm like well	2487.42	3.96
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you know	2490.3	2.94
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	1280	2491.38	4.56
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	was is resistance	2493.24	4.92
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so this brings up the idea of sector	2495.94	4.62
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	rotation so Aptos went	2498.16	4.86
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	through 1280.	2500.56	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	because of the intensity of the fomo see	2503.02	4.559
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you haven't seen this level of fomo in	2505.24	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Bitcoin ethereum and frequently what	2507.579	4.381
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	happens is like things that people don't	2509.5	4.92
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	own or don't think can go up they go up	2511.96	4.74
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there's massive fomo so here's like your	2514.42	4.199
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	God candle where this thing goes from 7	2516.7	3.419
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to 12.	2518.619	3.72
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	we have not seen this yet	2520.119	4.381
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now this could be an opportunity to	2522.339	3.061
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	possibly	2524.5	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	either take profits in Aptos and rotate	2525.4	5.939
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	them elsewhere like not all of them	2529.0	4.32
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so if you were able to get in at seven	2531.339	4.921
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you can huddle this but this looks toppy	2533.32	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	this looks like it's got to go sideways	2536.26	3.06
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	or go down	2538.0	3.839
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	or people just can store it just got a	2539.32	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	consolidate so there's nothing wrong	2541.839	3.541
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	with this but it may have to it may have	2543.82	4.019
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	to go sideways	2545.38	3.78
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and I don't think there's anything wrong	2547.839	3.361
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	with that Bitcoin ethereum basically	2549.16	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	unchanged right now	2551.2	6.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay xlm	2554.32	3.38
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	be really awesome if some of these old	2558.04	7.22
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	dead coins could wake up	2560.26	5.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay so if today's a down day in stellar	2569.14	4.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	depending on how you draw this	2575.5	3.56
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	support in Stellar is at .092	2582.099	6.601
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and the ultimate upside Target could be	2586.54	4.4
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	0.1	2588.7	5.52
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so this looks like a dip this could be a	2590.94	6.28
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	dip day or a sideways day	2594.22	6.119
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	give you the opportunity to get in so if	2597.22	6.54
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there's fear and fud Let It Drop	2600.339	6.441
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	let it find support	2603.76	3.02
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	in other words in a bull market	2610.0	5.28
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	red days are good	2612.46	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	like what did he say	2615.28	3.42
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	let me say it again	2617.14	5.959
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	in a bull market red days are good	2618.7	4.399
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	if you can buy it when it's down that's	2623.46	5.32
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the time to buy it	2626.26	8.46
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay so xdc wants to go to 0.03 cents	2628.78	9.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right xdc you know I got a lot of people	2634.72	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	looking at ICP	2637.78	5.28
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	red days are good now this may have been	2639.88	6.06
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	a little bit too much fomo here so you	2643.06	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	know you have a chance to come down to	2645.94	3.84
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	0.028	2647.74	6.72
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay we're gonna go to eblu	2649.78	4.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	foreign	2654.76	2.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay let's go to a weekly chart on this	2663.579	4.161
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so we're just going to do some standard	2670.66	5.179
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	FIB retracement stuff	2672.64	3.199
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so you know water infrastructure goes up	2677.92	6.78
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	from 2020 to 2022 gets hammered last	2680.8	7.319
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	year up where does it stop look at this	2684.7	7.919
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the 62 retracement the magical level	2688.119	7.141
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and then it starts to go the other way	2692.619	5.821
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so this is currently at 38 the high was	2695.26	7.02
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	52 and of course there's bark which you	2698.44	5.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	know people don't fully understand what	2702.28	4.62
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	this is yet that's okay because when the	2704.26	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	first big water order goes through and	2706.9	4.86
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the people pay and bark and people go	2709.42	4.56
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	did somebody just pay for water in	2711.76	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	crypto pick up that water and move it	2713.98	5.94
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	somewhere uh yeah these guys have	2716.92	4.98

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	problem through crypto yeah	2725.619	5.761
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	is there a blockchain mechanism for	2728.92	5.22
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Commodities that's actually useful that	2731.38	5.699
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	regular people can understand uh yeah	2734.14	4.56

sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay Pat said did we do chain link no we	2849.46	7.22
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	did not let me go back and do chain link	2852.16	4.52
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	foreign	2858.339	2.181
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I think when it comes to chain link I	2864.099	2.881
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	think when it comes to a lot of this	2865.9	4.219
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	stuff from the last cycle	2866.98	3.139
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I'm thinking the idea is stick with web	2872.38	4.76
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	3.	2874.54	2.6
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now here's the thing about chain link	2881.319	3.381
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's it's hard like you know what I got	2885.819	3.241
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	a great idea	2887.56	5.18
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	let's go over here and do it this way	2889.06	3.68
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay let's do chain link	2899.8	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	on a daily chart	2901.54	5.34
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	for DeMark	2904.24	5.42
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so in chain link there's resistance at	2906.88	5.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	762. it's not backing off but it's not	2909.66	5.439
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	exactly going up either	2912.7	4.2
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	chain link is one of these coins that	2915.099	4.881
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	needs a catalyst	2916.9	3.08
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so the good news is in chain link	2922.3	3.66
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	there's no sign of a DeMark top there's	2923.92	4.08
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	a d-wave top but it just means some	2925.96	4.379
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	consolidation may be in order	2928.0	5.22
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so I'm guessing that chain link is in a	2930.339	4.321
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	corrective phase and a lot of these	2933.22	4.02
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	other tokens that you know re-rated	2934.66	4.86
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	themselves off the low from the last	2937.24	3.78
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	cycle	2939.52	4.14
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	are just going to find a new range	2941.02	5.04
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so Chain Link stopped at the December	2943.66	5.64
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	High near seven dollars and it's coming	2946.06	6.299
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	off is it gonna blow up uh probably not	2949.3	5.4
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	but is this the thing you want to buy	2952.359	3.661
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the dip in	2954.7	3.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	if you've been huddling chain link I	2956.02	3.78
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	don't see any reason to not huddle chain	2957.94	2.639
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	link	2959.8	3.539
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	because you know the bigger the base the	2960.579	5.28
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	higher in the space and if chain link	2963.339	5.76
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	makes a base like this right where it	2965.859	6.421
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	goes sideways for you know an entire	2969.099	4.441
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	year	2972.28	4.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	that leads to upside assuming there's a	2973.54	5.279
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	catalyst sometimes you have to wait for	2976.54	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the catalysts right that's the thing	2978.819	5.161
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	about bark or about chain link or any of	2980.98	5.82
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	these coins Mark is what's next chain	2983.98	5.76
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	link was last Cycles news but that	2986.8	5.279
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	doesn't mean last Cycles news can't come	2989.74	5.4
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	back crypto pumps was from 2017 so it	2992.079	4.621
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	was chain link	2995.14	3.84
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so I'm not hating on chain link but it	2996.7	3.96
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	needs a catalyst if it gets one you've	2998.98	3.119
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	got the bigger the base the higher into	3000.66	3.84
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	space in the meantime I'm thinking about	3002.099	4.921
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	something that can like you know have a	3004.5	5.78
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	little bit more get up and go	3007.02	3.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay	3011.16	3.659
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	somebody's asking about algorand and	3012.54	3.84
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	sandbox	3014.819	4.5
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay so let's look at algorand	3016.38	7.04
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	no bit boy is very into this	3019.319	4.101
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	Wall Street love this for security	3024.24	3.9
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	tokens	3026.28	5.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay so an algorand on the daily chart	3028.14	7.26
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you've got a 13 top	3031.52	6.94
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and no one cares	3035.4	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	I mean someone cares because it went up	3038.46	4.08
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	today and they sold it	3040.56	4.86
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	uh do you have to fomo into algorand	3042.54	5.7
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right this second uh I don't think so	3045.42	6.899
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	but if Al gorand is above 24 cents it's	3048.24	5.64
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	probably going to wind up going back up	3052.319	3.54
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	again but you're probably going to get a	3053.88	3.3
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	dip	3055.859	5.641
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	so this would not be a fomo coin	3057.18	6.98
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	today	3061.5	2.66
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you know for for all I'm saying	3067.619	4.101
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right if Al Goran holds 24 or 25 cents	3072.18	6.06
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	it's actually going to hold above a	3075.78	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	prior resistance point so if algorand	3078.24	4.379
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	doesn't go down like I said if you get	3080.88	3.6
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the 13 top	3082.619	3.0
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	wait	3084.48	3.359
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	no he's wait a couple days	3085.619	4.861
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	if this doesn't go down	3087.839	5.941
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you're you've got your signal right the	3090.48	5.16
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	ceiling is now the floor	3093.78	4.98
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	let it prove itself give it two days	3095.64	4.979
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and then this could just go now if	3098.76	3.24
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	you've been holding this and suffering	3100.619	2.821
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	with it and you bought it at 50 cents	3102.0	3.42
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	leave it	3103.44	5.179
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	leave it give it a chance	3105.42	3.199
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	crypto discounts everything early crypto	3112.92	5.1
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	was down before the Fed rate before the	3115.2	4.56
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	the FED High grades and crypto was	3118.02	3.96
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	completely broken before the FED went	3119.76	3.299
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	ballistic	3121.98	3.06
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and crypto can turn itself around way	3123.059	3.841
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	before the FED turns itself around	3125.04	4.44
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	now sandbox coming off is kind of this	3126.9	3.78
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	kind of sucks	3129.48	3.78
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right it hit resistance around 86 cents	3130.68	4.56
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and it's coming off so let's look at the	3133.26	4.64
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	four hour chart	3135.24	2.66
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	okay so you have a demarc 5 wave top and	3140.339	5.881
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	this is the dip day or a dip week in the	3142.92	4.679
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	metaverse	3146.22	3.42
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	right if you're looking to add the	3147.599	4.861
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	sandbox and you get 67 cents that might	3149.64	5.219
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	be that might be Christmas	3152.46	4.98
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	and you might get two down days and some	3154.859	3.781
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	of these all coins that have been	3157.44	3.3
sllQlwagj7w	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllQlwagj7w	totally vertical	3158.64	4.199

LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Welcome to the Millennial 
Investing Podcast. I’m your host,	12.66	7.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Rebecca Hotsko and on today’s episode, I 
bring back Logan Kane. Welcome back, Logan.	19.98	5.377
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:02:09] Logan Kane: Yeah, thanks for 
having me back on Rebecca. I appreciate it.	25.357	3.296
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:02:12] Rebecca Hotsko: Thank you so much 
for coming back on. I’m really happy we got	28.653	3.747
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to do this again. I got so many great 
messages about your last episode and so	32.4	4.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	there’s a number of things I want to cover 
with you today, and I think a good place to	36.9	4.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	start is on one of the recent articles 
you wrote on how to be a better Bull.	41.82	4.8
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:02:29] Rebecca Hotsko: You 
talk about buying IJR in IJH,	46.62	4.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	which tracks the S&P 600 small cap index, 
and the ladder is the S&P 400 mid-cap index.	51.18	6.36
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Instead of just buying ETFs that track the 
S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 Index. And so I	57.54	7.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	think I want to cover this topic because 
I think it covers a few great things.	65.46	4.173
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:02:51] Rebecca Hotsko: First on how to 
just potentially improve your returns above	69.633	3.687
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the market. And then the second is just really 
understanding the underlying index that the	73.32	5.64
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	ETF tracks, because that can vastly lead 
to differences in performances just based	78.96	5.94
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	on that index. And so please walk us 
through your analysis on these two.	84.9	5.16
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:03:12] Logan Kane: Sure. I think the first 
thing that we can start with is the difference	90.06	4.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	between strategy and tactics for investors. 
So 99% of what you’re going to see right now,	94.98	5.58
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	this time of year on the market is going 
to be strategy. Where’s the S&P headed?	100.56	3.42
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	What earnings inflation, like where 
are we headed? But this is tactics.	104.76	4.717
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:03:28] Logan Kane: So the difference between 
strategy and tactics was first really dug into	109.477	4.643
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	by sun sue, Chinese military thinker, hundreds of 
years before the birth of Christ. He came out and	114.12	7.14
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	he said, okay, so there’s tactics and there’s 
strategy. So you gotta have good strategy and	121.26	3.54
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you gotta have good tactics. For example, like 
a strategy would be if you could predict where	124.8	5.58
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the market was going, but a tactic would 
be like, what’s the best fund to play?	130.38	3.3
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:03:51] Logan Kane: What we did on our 
last podcast when I came on was we did a lot	133.68	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	of tactics and I think that’s what people 
liked. We said, don’t buy Apple. You can	138.36	5.76
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	buy Berkshire Hathaway. because 40% of Berkshire 
Hathaway is Apple and Berkshire is much cheaper.	144.12	5.16
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	You buy the Google Class A stock rather 
than the Class C, it’s 1% cheaper.	150.36	3.48
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:04:08] Logan Kane: You see, you pick that 
up for free on the Grayscale, Bitcoin trust,	153.84	3.54
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you say you buy that instead of regular 
Bitcoin and you got the 50% discount.	157.38	3.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	There’s a big activist campaign that we’re 
going to talk about later. But I guess I’ll	161.04	4.98
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	refocus the question on the tactics with the 
S&P and why small and mid-caps are better.	166.02	4.297
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:04:23] Logan Kane: This 
is fairly uncontroversial.	170.317	1.943
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	It’s long-running academic research that typically 
small and mid-cap stocks outperform large cap	173.1	5.64
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	stocks. And there’s a few reasons why this is 
larger stocks are more popular, they get more	178.74	6.0
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	attention from investors. Smaller stocks have more 
room to grow. And historically, but not always.	184.74	6.037
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:04:41] Logan Kane: There’s often evaluation 
difference where you can get small cap stocks	190.777	3.623
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	for. This is very true right now, and it’s only 
been this big of a valuation gap in the 2000 tech	194.4	7.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	bubble, late nineties, early two thousands. 
So you have the S&P that’s quite expensive,	201.9	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and you have these small and mid-cap 
stocks, which are pretty cheap.	206.58	2.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:04:58] Logan Kane: So tactically, 
you move away from a lot of these mega	209.04	4.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	cap stocks that might be trading 40, 
50, 60 times earnings, and you go into	213.36	4.02
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	small caps that are trading 10, 12, 14 times 
earnings. It makes it a lot easier to make.	217.38	6.18
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	And the reason why IJH and I ijr is important here 
because the Russell 2000 is the most popular small	225.12	7.62
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	cap index, but it’s actually flawed, and 
this is just a classic tactic right here,	232.74	4.8
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but there’s a paper called Size 
Matters if you Control Your Junk.	237.54	4.177
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:05:27] Logan Kane: It was done by Cliff Asna 
if a QR. It’s the title’s meant to be ironic,	241.717	4.583
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	obviously, but it doesn’t matter if you invest in 
small cap stocks, if you invest in junk stocks,	246.3	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and a lot of small cap stocks are quite 
speculative. We’ve seen this with SPACs.	252.12	4.26
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	You could take anything public, it loses money. 
The beauty of the S&P 600, which is ticker IJR and	256.38	8.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the S&P 400, which is ticker IJH, is that you’re 
required to make money to be in this index and	264.84	7.14
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	a lot of small cap stocks, 30 40% of the broader 
universal small cap stocks lose [00:06:00] money.	271.98	5.557
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:06:00] Logan Kane: If we were going to invest 
in a brick and mortar business on Main Street,	277.537	3.443
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	we would not want to invest in one that 
loses money. But in the stock market,	280.98	3.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	there’s this idea that people take in 
efficient investing too far. So they say, yeah,	284.94	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	let’s just build an ETF with all the companies 
that lose the most money and we’ll invest in it.	289.62	4.237
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:06:15] Logan Kane: No, you invested that. 
You’re going to get crushed. The beauty of IJR	293.857	6.023
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and I G H, it’s these profitable companies and 
historically, if you go back to the late nineties,	299.88	5.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it outperforms by about 2% per year versus the 
broader index with the money losing companies.	305.34	5.52
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	This is related to the academic trend 
of quality, so that size matter.	312.18	4.837
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:06:34] Logan Kane: So if you control your junk 
paper by Cliff aau, he’s the founder of aqr. It’s	317.017	3.743
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	one of the world’s biggest hedge. That’s the key 
insight is that you need to tilt towards quality	320.76	6.36
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	in your portfolio at all levels, but especially 
in small cap stocks, cause it’s kind of hard for	327.12	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	them to get financing, especially when the 
economy turns down, if they’re losing money.	331.8	3.06
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:06:52] Logan Kane: I really like that	334.86	3.453
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:06:53] Rebecca Hotsko: article. I 
think it pointed out so many great things,	338.313	2.787
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	all of which you just mentioned. And I was quite 
surprised at the [00:07:00] mid-cap performance,	341.1	5.28
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	which was very close to small cap over time. And 
so that’s actually a segment of the market I’ve	346.38	7.02
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	kind of ignored, to be honest, just 
because I’ve been factor investing.	353.4	4.293
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:07:11] Rebecca Hotsko: But there is a lot of, 
I guess, research on how the small cap premium	357.693	5.547
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	could be dwindling. And I actually had a. On 
who talked about, they don’t view small cap	363.24	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	as a factor anymore or a premium. They just 
view it as an extension to get more stocks,	369.06	7.08
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	more exposure to stocks with these other 
qualities. It was an interesting view	376.14	4.8
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	because at the end of the day, we just want to 
earn the most money by doing the least amount.	380.94	5.373
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:07:36] Rebecca Hotsko: And so small 
cap stocks, there’s so many more of them,	386.313	3.327
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and so it just gives you a wider 
variety for diversification.	389.64	3.48
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:07:44] Logan Kane: I think if I might hear, 
I would probably push back on the idea that the	393.12	6.54
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	small cap premium is dwindling. I think you 
can attribute all of that to junk stocks	399.66	5.16
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	in the small cap universe for the Russell 
2000 versus that’s the index with the junk.	404.82	5.797
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:07:57] Logan Kane: It’s got about 80, 90% 
[00:08:00] market share with small cap index	410.617	3.983
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	funds. S and d 600 has much less market share. So 
a lot of the money that’s going into small caps	414.6	6.48
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	is simply being lit on. You invest it in these 
companies and they’re trying to do space tourism,	421.08	8.64
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	or they’re trying to do just like wacky 
zany stuff and they get this money.	429.72	6.697
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:08:20] Logan Kane: Cause you know, your 
401K provider says, Hey, this is the Russell’s	436.417	3.743
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	2000 just but it there’s no quality control and 
that’s kind of the genius, these indexes. That is	440.16	8.58
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	going to be a debate and that’s an argument for 
mid-caps, I think, because they are so ignored.	448.74	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	But I like IJR and I, like IJH and 
we could probably run it in a horse	456.18	4.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	race against AVUV and I think 
you mentioned some other funds.	460.56	3.3
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:08:42] Logan Kane: So, I guess	463.86	3.333
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:08:44] Rebecca Hotsko: that message is 
small cap. You believe the premium still	467.193	4.347
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	exists when quality is controlled for, 
and so IJR is one that does very well at	471.54	9.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	that and avoid the Russell 2000 indexes 
or ETFs, subtract that. But then, yeah,	481.2	4.62
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	last time we [00:09:00] also touched on small cap 
value because that gets into different territory.	485.82	4.893
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:09:04] Rebecca Hotsko: There’s a bunch of 
ETFs. Give you exposure to small cap value and	490.713	5.307
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	out of the small cap value ETFs, which would 
you say is your preferred way to invest in that	514.38	6.397
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:09:14] Logan Kane: segment? We kind of 
let back and forth before the show unplug	520.777	5.603
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	some of these ETFs. And Rebecca mentioned AVUV 
for the listeners. It’s a really good etf.	526.38	6.217
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:09:24] Logan Kane: I looked at it and I 
think there’s a good chance that if I were to	532.597	4.643
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	choose ijr and if she were to choose that and 
we were to say, Hey, let’s place a bat and see	537.24	4.2
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	which one does better in five years, I think it 
could win. I think A B U V could win. The expense	541.44	5.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	ratio is a little higher. She’s spotting 
me about 20 basis points per year on this.	546.54	5.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:09:41] Logan Kane: If you were to 
choose that and I were to choose IJR	552.84	2.04
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but I think AVUV could have the advantage. You 
gotta watch sector exposure in some of these	554.88	6.78
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	ETFs because it can, if you had a 
lot of energy exposure last year,	561.66	2.94
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it could make you look really good and if 
you didn’t it could make you look really bad.	564.6	3.397
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:09:56] Logan Kane: Historically, it’s not that 
insane with like energy being up [00:10:00] 60%	567.997	5.543
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	in the market, being down 20, that’s pretty 
extreme for a sector outperform, I mean, 80,	573.54	6.48
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	80 percentage points about performance in a year 
is pretty extreme. But I think small value is	580.02	7.2
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	among the most well-known like areas of the market 
that you want to be and most people really don’t.	589.32	4.897
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:10:16] Logan Kane: It seems like everybody’s 
doing factors, but most people really don’t. I	594.217	4.283
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	mean, a lot of people are just putting money 
in Tesla and like just, they’re just chasing	598.5	4.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the hottest stocks. There are a few areas of the 
market where factors might be a little overplayed.	603.42	5.76
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	The easiest is probably momentum. Momentum funds 
are pretty notorious for not being able to live	609.18	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	up to there, because anytime you’re betting 
on the behavior of others, it becomes reflex.	615.06	5.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:10:40] Logan Kane: I prefer the kind 
of anomalies that correlate to better	621.3	4.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	businesses rather than kind of anomalies that 
correlate to other investors being irrational,	625.8	4.44
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	unless there’s like hard constraints 
that are going to cause them to do	630.24	3.84
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	that for a long time in the future, 
which we can get into later. That	634.08	3.993
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:10:55] Rebecca Hotsko: is such a good 
point because the momentum premium actually	638.073	3.507
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	has [00:11:00] the highest odds 
of out performance in every year.	641.58	3.993
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:11:03] Rebecca Hotsko: But I would argue 
it’s the hardest to actually achieve because	645.573	3.507
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it’s such a high turnover strategy 
and I think it’s often implemented,	649.08	5.22
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	perhaps ineffectively, and it’s just, it’s hard to	654.3	2.557
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:11:14] Logan Kane: capture. 
It’s very hard to capture with the	656.857	2.543
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	ET T F, especially if it’s a multi-billion 
dollar et t f. As a tactic, if we’re like,	659.4	5.64
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	if we own some socks and they’re going up 
a lot and we want to write the momentum,	665.04	4.08
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it’s great, but it’s very hard to build a 
fund around it because your fund is so big.	669.12	5.737
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:11:30] Logan Kane: You become, if you’re 
not the predator, you become the prey with	674.857	3.023
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	some of this momentum stuff. Zero sum. Like if 
we invest in these businesses, right, our return	677.88	8.64
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	is the return of the business. So if you invest 
in a better business, you get a higher return. I	686.52	5.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	personally think that’s easier than just playing 
poker against people in like SPACs or something.	692.16	6.42
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:11:50] Logan Kane: Like I said, unless you 
have like institutional advantages or you have	698.58	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	a better capital stack, it’s very hard 
just like, beat people on this because	703.26	4.8
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you know you’re going against computer [00:12:00] 
programs, you’re going against all kinds of stuff.	708.06	3.48
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	It’s hard to beat, in my opinion. So I also want	713.4	56.853
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:12:04] Rebecca Hotsko: to talk 
to you about a few specific stocks.	770.253	3.6
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:12:08] Rebecca Hotsko: Now we’re going to 
get into it because our listeners really loved	773.853	2.667
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	your deep dive on Google and Apple, where last 
time you mentioned how you don’t like Apple,	776.52	4.98
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but you do like Google and you think that 
it would give investors sufficient returns	781.5	4.98
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	under $80 per share. I think also under $90 
per share you said wasn’t too bad as well.	786.48	6.24
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:12:27] Rebecca Hotsko: I wanted to follow up 
on this because of new AI that has been getting	792.72	6.6
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	a lot of attention lately, like chat, G P 
T, which has just been, I don’t know, it’s,	799.32	6.48
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	we were talking about this before the interview. 
There’s just so many applications and maybe some	805.8	5.22
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	concern that AI could dominate the search engine 
space now, and so I wanted to get your views on.	811.02	7.121
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:12:51] Rebecca Hotsko: And this 
new disruptive technology, how you	818.141	3.799
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	think that could, is it a big competitor 
to Google and should they be worried?	821.94	4.44
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:12:59] Logan Kane: I did [00:13:00] an 
article on this and I did some research on	827.24	5.08
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	chat G P T and, and Google. And I was 
like, huh, I was like, the media got	832.32	7.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	very ahead of itself on the metaverse, 
and I’m like, is this for real or not?	839.64	4.237
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:13:12] Logan Kane: But then I actually 
tried this thing out and it’s really good if	843.877	4.163
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you haven’t tried this thing out, like go try 
it. And I mean, this thing is doing people’s,	848.04	6.0
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it’s doing kids like homework. It’s like, 
they’re getting a’s on the homework. Like	854.04	6.06
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you can have it write cover letters 
for like if you’re applying for jobs.	860.1	2.983
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:13:27] Logan Kane: I was having it 
write poetry. That’s. This startup has been,	863.083	7.697
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	so they come out with this bombshell 
AI chat bot, and people are saying,	870.78	5.22
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	can this take on Google? The answer is maybe it 
depends on the type of chat. I reached out to my	876.0	6.12
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	friend in Dubai who runs a tech startup, and she 
was like, this is legit. Like this is for real.	882.12	6.397
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:13:48] Logan Kane: I was expecting her to 
just be like, oh, don’t worry about it. But	888.517	3.683
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	since, since we’re talking about Google here 
and AI disruption, I think Google is probably	892.2	6.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	one of the last companies we have to worry 
about being disrupted by ai. [00:14:00] They	899.1	3.6
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	have substantial investment in ai. They have 
their own ai. It costs more money to run.	902.7	5.64
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:14:05] Logan Kane: Some of my readers 
have commented that ChatGPT. Sorry,	908.34	6.48
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I can’t pronounce it. It’s G P T, but I’m just 
going to say G P T because it’s easier for me. ,	914.82	5.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it’s costing them a lot of money to run this and 
they’re not making any revenue off of it, which	920.88	4.2
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	is likely why Google hasn’t made the upgrade yet. 
They’re bringing in Microsoft, they’re likely to.	925.08	6.577
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:14:22] Logan Kane: Microsoft is, I don’t know 
if it’s announced yet or if they’re negotiating	931.657	3.443
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it, but Microsoft’s going to pump in like 
10 billion and then they are going to try	935.1	5.52
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to take on Google. And again, I think this 
is a case where you could probably buy both.	940.62	3.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I think Google and Microsoft are 
among the cheaper stocks in tech.	945.12	3.18
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:14:38] Logan Kane: Apple and Amazon. 
And Tesla being the more expensive than I	949.44	2.94
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	would avoid. If you can get Microsoft 
10% lower, I’d buy it. If you can get	952.38	3.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Google at today’s price, I would buy 
it. It’s really interesting. I mean,	956.04	4.26
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the world is continuing to evolve 
with tech and AI just has tremendous.	960.3	5.52
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	What’s going to be disrupted, I think is more 
likely to be a lot of brick and mortar businesses.	966.9	4.057
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:14:58] Logan Kane: Like if you’re a 
pharmacist, I would be a [00:15:00] little	970.957	2.603
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	bit worried about what AI could do to your 
job. If you’re a writer on Seeking Alpha,	973.56	4.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	maybe a little less. I asked it to recommend 
me some investment strategies, and they were	978.06	4.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	pretty plain vanilla. I don’t think Chat 
G B T is ready to manage your money yet.	982.98	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:15:13] Logan Kane: That’s so	987.66	1.473
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:15:13] Rebecca Hotsko: funny. Yeah, 
I got it to do quite a bit for me too.	989.133	2.727
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I got it to write me lease agreements 
and that’s one thing that I think is so	991.86	4.62
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	crazy how accurate it was. And you still 
need to know what to put in what inputs,	996.48	6.6
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but it’s just going to get better over time. 
And so I’ve had a lot of fun using it as well.	1003.08	7.363
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:15:31] Logan Kane: The more formulaic, 
what you’re doing is the more trouble AI	1010.443	3.617
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	can cause. It is interesting, like since the 
pandemic, you go to McDonald’s or somewhere and	1014.06	6.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	where somebody might have checked you out, 
a cashier, you might go to a computer now,	1021.02	4.2
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and AI really accelerates the ability of 
machines to replace man in a lot of cases.	1025.22	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:15:50] Logan Kane: In the end, I don’t 
think it’s going to save the world or ruin it,	1031.1	5.4
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but I think it’s going to be a huge 
incremental improvement on technology.	1036.5	3.84
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	It can really increase productivity. Like if 
you’re [00:16:00] a software programmer and	1042.62	3.54
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you have this right code or edit your code and 
then you look at Oprah, it’s, it’s pretty good.	1046.16	4.357
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:16:05] Logan Kane: I mean, 
it’s, it’s pretty powerful.	1050.517	2.203
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:16:08] Rebecca Hotsko: 
I haven’t done that yet,	1052.72	2.44
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but I have seen so many videos of people 
asking it to write them codes for trading,	1055.16	5.22
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	for anything, and it works. And so lots of 
applications. And I guess the other thing is,	1060.38	6.6
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I was just trying to think about how this 
could disrupt the advertising on Google,	1066.98	5.28
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	because when you type in chat G P T, it’s like 
what are the 10 best restaurants in Colonna, bc?	1072.26	7.293
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:16:31] Rebecca Hotsko: They would have to 
come up with some type of search algorithm based.	1079.553	4.047
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Because Google, you pay a certain amount 
per click to have your business show up,	1084.2	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and so it’s just interesting to see 
how that could compete with the open	1090.02	5.077
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:16:45] Logan Kane: ai.	1095.097	0.623
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	One of my readers also commented on this, 
I’m lucky to have some really smart readers.	1097.46	3.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:16:52] Logan Kane: There’s two kinds of 
searches. There’s informational searches,	1101.42	4.14
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and then there’s transactional searches. So 
informational searches. AI potentially has	1105.56	5.4
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	a [00:17:00] pretty large advantage, but let’s say 
somebody searches car wreck lawyer, Dallas, Texas.	1110.96	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	The AI is probably not going to have a lot 
to say, but if you search that on Google,	1117.5	5.04
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	then you know you get these lawyers and they’ll 
pay big bucks to Google to be top on that.	1122.54	5.497
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:17:14] Logan Kane: Cause personal injury 
attorney leads are worth a ton of money. That’s	1128.037	4.763
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	actually one of the highest value keywords on all 
of Google. I think this is potentially a threat	1132.8	4.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to Google. It’s also potentially an opportunity 
if Google stock is getting cheaper because of.	1137.72	4.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I remember people thought Amazon 
was going to take over healthcare,	1142.88	3.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	or people think Apple might 
take over the car business.	1146.84	2.977
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:17:34] Logan Kane: It’s just not 
going to happen. Not that the car	1149.817	5.543
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	business is generally automaker stocks aren’t 
typically the best places to put your capital,	1155.36	5.04
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but anytime people get caught up in some of 
these narratives and they overplay them, I think	1161.24	5.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	there’s potential. And Google remains cheap here. 
I think the long-term compensation is pretty good.	1166.34	5.497
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:17:52] Logan Kane: I mean, 15 
plus percent annual returns is what	1171.837	3.323
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I would expect over the next 10 years. Partly 
because of AI and partly in spite. [00:18:00]	1175.16	3.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:18:00] Rebecca Hotsko: I will have you 
back on again and we’ll get updated views	1179.12	4.86
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	because I think the interesting thing 
about company’s competitive advantages,	1183.98	4.08
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and I talked about this in my year end episode, 
my learnings from guests is that they can change	1188.06	5.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	what was once considered a moat or a company’s 
competitive advantage can change over time.	1193.52	5.313
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:18:17] Rebecca Hotsko: And so like 
you said, AI could benefit Google or it	1198.833	3.987
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	could really hurt it in the long term, and we 
don’t know right now. And so it’s just worth	1202.82	4.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	knowing about and I guess watching it as it 
evolve. And so I guess the other thing though,	1207.2	4.86
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I wanted to ask you before I get 
into your top picks for 2023 is	1212.06	4.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	how to be a better bear because you 
talked about how to be a better bull.	1216.44	4.26
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:18:38] Rebecca Hotsko: On the 
flip side though, if investors are	1220.7	3.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	just bearish and they don’t perhaps want to 
deploy capital into the market right now,	1224.36	5.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	what are their other options and how can 
they make money while still being a bear?	1229.82	5.16
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:18:52] Logan Kane: We’re going to do more 
tactics here. If you’re bullish on the market,	1234.98	5.16
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it gave you some choices if you’re bearish 
or about to give you some more choices.	1240.14	3.337
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:18:58] Logan Kane: The best I have 
[00:19:00] found for right now is Vanguard	1243.477	4.403
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Money Market Funds. You can theoretically 
get a little more from treasury bills	1247.88	3.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	under some of these auto roll programs, 
but for a lot of investors it’s not worth	1252.56	4.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it because if your broker is charging 
you a bid ask spread, you really have	1256.88	4.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to run it in Excel and see if the bid asks 
Spread is exceeding the yield in the money	1261.44	3.72
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	market or exceeding the difference in the yield 
between the money market and the treasuries.	1265.16	3.937
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:19:21] Logan Kane: Treasury directs an 
option that people have kind of said it’s a.	1269.097	3.683
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	The Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund is paying 
about 4.2% right now, 4.34. 4.4. By the time you	1274.52	8.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	hear this, I think that’s your best bet. And 
the reason why this is a tactic is because when	1282.62	6.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you just stick your money in a brokerage 
account, chances are you’re getting zero.	1289.28	3.937
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:19:41] Logan Kane: And a lot of people don’t 
know this because over the last 14 years, interest	1293.217	4.463
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	rates have been zero for almost all of the time. 
So people got trained to not expect interest.	1297.68	5.7
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	And this is part of why I like the financial 
sector this. Americans alone are leaving 40,	1303.38	6.18
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	50 billion a year on the table just from not 
caring about interest [00:20:00] anymore.	1309.56	3.997
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:20:00] Logan Kane: I think they’ll 
eventually learn, but they’re not learning yet.	1313.557	4.403
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	If you put money in Vanguard, they’re pretty 
classy about it. They’ll automatically put	1321.26	3.3
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it in this money market fund, but if you put 
it in like E-Trade or Fidelity, they’ll just	1324.56	4.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	put it in a sweep account and it doesn’t 
pay as much in the the broker profits.	1330.5	3.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:20:15] Logan Kane: If you use one 
of these brokers, you can still put	1334.16	3.42
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it in money market funds. You just have to 
know that. You just have to know that this	1337.58	4.14
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	is a thing and that you have to manage your 
cash. The other thing with the money market	1341.72	5.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	funds is Vanguard has a municipal money 
market fund and then they have a federal.	1347.18	6.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:20:32] Logan Kane: The advantage of the 
federal is that you don’t pay state income	1354.08	3.42
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	tax. The advantage of the municipal is that you 
don’t pay federal income tax. There’s a set of	1357.5	5.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	calculations that you can do here, but the break 
even is around 20%. Right now with the tax rate,	1362.6	4.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and this is pretty typical actually, 
and this is interesting because we	1367.52	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	might talk about market pricing being fairly 
efficient, but everybody has a different tax.	1372.2	4.783
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:20:53] Logan Kane: Some investors pay zero tax 
because they’re institutions like pension funds.	1376.983	6.497
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Some investors are in the top [00:21:00] bracket 
and they might pay, like, for example, if you’re a	1383.48	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	New York taxpayer top bracket, you might pay 50% 
on interest on just ordinary income interests.	1389.36	6.84
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	These different people who are in the market have 
different preferences and different tax rates.	1398.0	4.357
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:21:13] Logan Kane: That creates opportunities. 
If you know your own situation and you know how	1402.357	3.203
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	stuff is priced, you can compare stuff for 
a tactic. 3.5% of the municipal money market	1405.56	6.18
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	fund versus 4.2 is an easy win for somebody in 
a top tax bracket, you’d have to get almost 6%.	1411.74	4.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	And this is a classic tactic that like advisors 
and like just savvy investors are able to use.	1417.14	6.157
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:21:32] Logan Kane: But it, it’s good to 
know if you’re in the top tax bracket in the	1423.297	3.083
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	US and investing in taxable account, the municipal 
money market fund is the best place for your cash,	1426.38	5.34
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	almost always. And if you’re in a lower tax 
bracket, then the federal has probably going to.	1431.72	6.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:21:47] Rebecca Hotsko:	1438.38	1.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	And then I was looking into it. I 
couldn’t find it on my brokerage account.	1439.94	4.413
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:21:52] Rebecca Hotsko: 
But are there any, I guess,	1444.353	2.727
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	because typically, sometimes you’re held up for 
a certain amount of time when you invest in these	1447.86	4.86
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	type of [00:22:00] securities. But that’s 
not the case with this Vanguard fund. Right?	1452.72	3.06
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:22:03] Logan Kane: It should be one 
day. It’s like a mutual fund. So you	1456.68	4.02
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	redeem and then you get your money in one 
day. People have like, ask me about this.	1460.7	6.637
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:22:10] Logan Kane: So like, what if the 
market crashes in one day and I want to buy,	1467.337	3.503
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and you give up that one day of flexibility. But 
like if the market has the massive one day crash,	1470.84	7.98
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you can just buy in the morning. I don’t think 
it’s worth paying a hundred basis points a year	1478.82	6.24
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	for the ability to buy. I mean, you’re effectively 
paying a hundred basis points a year for the	1485.06	4.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	ability to buy at two 30 in the afternoon 
rather than wait until the next morning.	1489.62	4.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:22:34] Logan Kane: That makes sense.	1494.44	3.133
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:22:35] Rebecca Hotsko: Now I 
think onto the fun stuff. I want	1497.573	9.987
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to get your top picks for 2023. I 
know you’ve written some articles	1507.56	5.7
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	on this. Please share what you 
think your top picks are for the	1513.26	3.877
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:22:47] Logan Kane: year. The best 
place to be last year was energy. I mean,	1517.137	4.643
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	energy had a historic year. I think the best 
place to be this year is going to be financial.	1521.78	5.737
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:22:57] Logan Kane: And it’s for the 
same reason we were just talking about	1527.517	2.543
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	on the Be [00:23:00] A Better Bear is that 
people are not used to earning interests on	1530.06	4.44
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	their bank and brokerage accounts, but the Feds 
continues to hike rates, so the difference just	1534.5	4.62
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	goes straight into profit for the banks. 
Now we’re recording this January 13th.	1539.12	5.857
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:23:12] Logan Kane: So the big banks reported 
earnings today and they’re all pretty good, but	1544.977	4.403
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	some banks more than others have started to 
put money in loss reserves for consensual	1549.38	4.86
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	recession. So on one hand you have big net 
interest income coming in from the Fed,	1554.24	7.44
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and then on the other hand you 
have this fear of recession.	1561.68	1.957
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:23:28] Logan Kane: But I think if you do a 
half decent job of picking the banks, I think	1563.637	4.763
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you can get some good stuff here. 
Cause evaluations are pretty low.	1571.04	2.76
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	The dividend yields are good. And 
by the way, on those lost reserves,	1573.8	3.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	if they don’t end up incurring the losses in the 
end, they can add them back into their net income.	1578.18	4.717
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:23:42] Logan Kane: It’s just a reserve. 
It’s an accounting thing. Like this happened	1582.897	3.383
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	during Covid. They thought they were going to take 
a ton of losses and then they didn’t. So they got,	1586.28	4.2
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	they had big earnings in 2021 when the 
losses weren’t as bad as expected. So,	1590.48	4.8
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I mean, we were talking earlier, the pricing 
for banks within the sector is pretty efficient.	1595.28	5.797
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:23:59] Logan Kane: I think [00:24:00] the 
pricing for the sector as a whole is wrong, and	1601.077	5.603
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the reason I think it’s wrong gets back to this 
14 years of almost zero interest rate environment.	1606.68	7.62
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	This compressed the margins for banks that. 
QE is often thought of as helping the economy,	1616.04	6.24
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but the problem with the QE and the 
zero interest rate policy is that	1622.28	4.44
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	anybody who earns interest is not 
going to earn very much interest.	1627.56	3.42
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:24:24] Logan Kane: I think investors are not 
fully appreciating the earning power of these	1630.98	5.4
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	banks that have kind of slept over the past 
14 years. You get back to a normal interest	1636.38	4.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	rate environment, the earnings just explode. It 
depends on their recession. Like it depends on,	1640.76	7.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I’m not particularly bullish on the housing 
market if you really want to take a flyer.	1648.68	10.537
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:24:41] Logan Kane: Canadian banks 
are very cheap. They’re very exposed	1659.217	3.683
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to the Canadian housing market actually. I mean,	1662.9	3.0
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I say that the lending standards are a lot more 
conservative in Canada, but they’re still going	1665.9	6.24
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to have a lot of exposure to the housing 
market in Canada. So they could take losses	1672.14	4.62
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	that’ll be more severe than American banks, 
which have fixed rate [00:25:00] mortgage.	1677.36	3.54
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:25:00] Logan Kane: If you think the 
compensation’s enough, you can get five,	1680.9	3.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	six, 7% yields in a lot of cases. Bank stocks in 
the us I like Truist. I like Truist because it has	1684.86	8.52
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	a funny name and it’s less popular than Bank of 
America and JP Morgan, but the business is pretty	1693.38	6.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	good. The business performs pretty similarly. 
JP Morgan has a higher return on equity.	1700.04	5.58
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:25:20] Logan Kane: I think this is in part 
due to its investment banking business. The JP	1706.46	3.84
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Morgan has a very good investment bank. Truist is 
more, it’s more like you go down to the branch,	1710.3	5.34
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you might get a loan for your business, you go 
deposit your money. But the demographics are	1715.64	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	very good for Truist being. They 
have a lot of branches in Texas.	1720.32	3.877
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:25:36] Logan Kane: A lot of branches 
in Florida. I’m the Mid-Atlantic. It’s a	1724.197	3.563
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	good place to. So I like Truist. Citigroup 
is probably the cheapest bank you could buy	1727.76	5.22
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	in the us It’s trading about half of its 
book value. They’re getting out of some	1732.98	4.98
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	unprofitable international businesses. And 
once that’s done, I think Citi’s okay here.	1737.96	5.983
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:25:53] Logan Kane: The Bank of America 
looks good. The only one I would really avoid	1743.943	4.217
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	of the big banks is Wells Fargo. This week 
they announced they’re [00:26:00] getting	1748.16	4.02
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	out of the mortgage business except for 
minorities and existing customers. So I	1752.18	5.34
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	immediately read this as trying to reframe the 
narrative in their poor earnings this week.	1757.52	4.08
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:26:08] Logan Kane: Without getting too much 
into the politics, anytime companies emphasize	1762.44	4.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	things other than earnings around earnings, 
it tends to be that the earnings are not that	1766.82	4.08
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	good. If a company has really good earnings, 
they’ll just emphasize their earnings during	1770.9	4.86
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	earnings weeks, which brings me to. Tim Cook 
just had the board vote him a 40% pay cut.	1775.76	8.377
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:26:26] Logan Kane: So if you’re looking 
forward to what Apple earnings are going to	1784.137	2.243
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	be later this month, that might be a little bit of	1786.38	2.34
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	trouble for Apple up. He’s cutting 
his pay in half or almost in half.	1788.72	3.24
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:26:35] Rebecca Hotsko: It’s really 
interesting to see how cheap they are	1793.1	34.86
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	relative to almost every other sector. And 
so I do like those picks that you gave.	1827.96	5.733
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:26:44] Rebecca Hotsko: I was looking 
into them a bit more last night and it	1833.693	3.267
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	just does make me wonder though, 
what is the threshold where. Yes,	1836.96	4.02
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	rising interest rates improves their net interest 
margin, and I was even reading an article last	1840.98	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	night that was talking about the deposit 
beta for Citigroup. [00:27:00] For example,	1846.8	4.26
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	every time interest rates rise by it was like 
50 basis points that has the potential to	1851.06	5.64
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	increase their net interest income by it was 2.5 
billion, which is quite crazy if you think about.	1856.7	8.34
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:27:14] Rebecca Hotsko: Okay, so the 
expectation is that there’s still going	1865.04	3.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to be a couple more rate hikes. That’s what’s, 
I guess, expected by the market so far. And so	1868.94	5.7
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it does seem quite promising, but then you 
have to weigh what you were talking about	1874.64	4.02
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	with the increased potential of bad things 
happening, people defaulting because of that.	1878.66	6.12
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:27:31] Rebecca Hotsko: Is your view 
then still that the positive increase	1884.78	5.58
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	in net interest is going to outweigh 
the negative effects in the economy?	1890.36	4.94
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:27:40] Logan Kane: I think some investors 
might be fighting The last war here,	1895.3	4.6
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	bank stocks were destroyed in 2008.	1900.44	3.84
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	In the last recession. Before that, in the 
early two thousands, bank stocks they did okay.	1904.28	5.137
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:27:52] Logan Kane: I mean, they’re 
down about half as much as the market,	1909.417	2.003
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but the Fed also cut rates from 6% to zero. 
During that time, not zero, they come to about 1%.	1911.42	5.04
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	You [00:28:00] have this huge 
like IT pressure on banks,	1917.3	3.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and then they came back, and then 2008 
dumped. If interest rates stay high here,	1920.96	4.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	obviously you have this tail end getting really 
good compensation and a lot of times, this is how	1926.42	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I think of stocks in terms of compensation 
rather than in terms of like binary events.	1932.24	5.04
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:28:17] Logan Kane: If you’re paying 10, 9, 
10 times earnings for these banks, then getting	1937.28	5.52
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	pretty good compensation, they can take some 
losses because you’re getting a lot of points	1942.8	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	on the spread. We’ll see. I mean, in the 2000, 
2002 recession, I mean, unemployment led to 6%.	1948.68	6.54
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	If unemployment goes to 6% 
here, I mean, that’s no problem.	1956.96	2.857
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:28:35] Logan Kane: If 
unemployment goes to 10 or 12,	1959.817	2.183
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	then we’re, we’re not going 
to make money in banks. But	1962.0	2.7
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I’m not sure what other stocks you will make money 
in. If unemployment goes to 12% in the us, I mean,	1965.72	4.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	everything will go down. You might as well cover 
the most number of scenario of likely scenario.	1970.1	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I think you’ve got 90% of scenarios covered with 
banks here of either interest rates staying higher	1977.12	5.16
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and the economy does well, the economy going 
into recession, because interest rates stay up.	1982.28	4.597
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:28:58] Logan Kane: Inflation [00:29:00] 
isn’t a huge deal for the banks in my	1986.877	3.803
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	view because the fed’s fighting it, but 
customers are still trained to get zero,	1990.68	4.02
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	so like inflation can actually benefit them 
here. I think the setup is good. I think	1994.7	6.12
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	people aren’t appreciating them, and I think 
that’s the essence of value investing. Right.	2000.82	4.02
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:29:14] Rebecca Hotsko: I agree.	2004.84	1.953
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:29:15] Rebecca Hotsko: It does look 
very attractive right now. And I guess just	2006.793	3.687
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	on that point, because you just talked about how 
unemployment, if it reaches 10% or 8%, that could	2010.48	6.84
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	signal things. It’s going to be issues for the 
bank. What else would maybe change your thesis?	2017.32	4.44
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Would it be if the Fed perhaps pivots because 
something breaks in the economy before that?	2021.76	5.913
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:29:34] Rebecca Hotsko: Because there’s 
lots of. That I’ve at least had with other	2027.673	3.147
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	guests how it could happen just because 
something breaks in the economy and even	2030.82	5.16
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	in the global economy that forces them 
to pivot. So it might not even be within,	2035.98	5.28
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I guess, the US that really causes that, 
such as they’ve reached their inflation	2041.26	4.297
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:29:51] Logan Kane: target.	2045.557	0.383
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:29:52] Logan Kane: So, I mean, a lot of 
people are clamoring for the Fed Pivot. I mean,	2045.94	5.4
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	we’re not talking a whole lot of macro here, 
but stocks are very [00:30:00] expensive. Yet	2051.34	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	people think the fed’s going to. People view 
the Fed cutting interest rates as a solution.	2057.22	5.52
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	But I think to some extent the Fed keeping 
interest rates too low is actually the problem.	2063.52	4.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:30:10] Logan Kane: I think that can make 
growth lower. For example, let’s say you’re	2068.68	4.86
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	retired, right? And the Fed cuts rates is zero. 
Retired people look around and they say, Hey,	2074.2	5.4
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you can’t get a return anywhere, so I’m going 
to cut back my spending. See that’s a problem.	2079.6	4.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	It increases certain areas, the economy and 
stimulates certain areas, see the economy,	2085.3	4.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but it holds back other areas, 
like classically, like in Europe,	2089.86	3.84
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	they did this negative interest rate thing 
and then their banks couldn’t make any money.	2094.54	4.417
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:30:34] Logan Kane: So in the end they found 
it hard to get banks to loan people, money.	2098.957	3.443
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Consumers who might have a million, 2 million 
euros in the bank are like, well, I guess I	2102.94	5.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	can only spend 20, 30,000 euros a year because 
I’m not getting any return on my investment.	2108.04	5.28
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I’m not convinced that cutting interest rates 
to zero would actually help the economy.	2116.86	3.757
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:30:51] Logan Kane: I mean, the mainstream 
theory would tell you that it would,	2120.617	2.663
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but I’m, I’m not sure here, especially with 
inflation, cause over the last 15 years,	2123.28	6.12
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	inflation has been [00:31:00] very benign 
and now it’s, it’s the opposite of that.	2129.4	4.14
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	If we shift regimes here, banks sucks are where 
you want to be. If we go back to the old regime,	2134.14	5.52
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and I don’t know, we go back to a slow growth, 
high unemployment world with zero interest	2139.66	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	rates and you don’t want to own banks, but you 
really don’t want to own anything else either.	2145.48	3.157
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:31:16] Logan Kane: You’d probably want 
to own government bonds in that case. That’s	2148.637	4.856
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:31:20] Rebecca Hotsko: a good point. And then 
maybe that goes back to your tactics of how to be	2153.493	3.807
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	a better bear, but then we wouldn’t even want 
that. Cause then interest rates would be zero.	2157.3	5.76
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:31:29] Logan Kane: You would just take as much	2163.06	2.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	duration as you could and you go 
buy a bunch of 30 year treasury.	2165.52	2.857
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:31:33] Logan Kane: You go buy 
long-term corporate bonds, and then they,	2168.377	4.103
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	they’re paying 5% now on the corporates and 4% 
close to 4% on some of the treasuries. You got	2172.48	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	your duration locked in and then, and then 
you would earn the difference. Okay, so we	2178.3	4.893
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:31:46] Rebecca Hotsko: just talked about your 
top picks for 2023. And now I want to talk about	2183.193	5.427
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	another strategy that you got me interested 
in, and that is called return stacking.	2188.62	5.133
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:31:58] Rebecca Hotsko: And so last time 
we were talking about [00:32:00] how you tend	2193.753	3.267
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to like quantitative strategies and now they’re 
available to investors through a lot of low cost	2197.02	6.84
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	ETFs are just really not that 
hard to implement these days,	2203.86	3.3
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but a lot of us don’t know about them. 
And so I found this strategy super,	2207.16	4.74
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	super interesting and I was hoping that you could 
explain it for our listeners and how it works.	2211.9	4.26
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:32:20] Logan Kane: Sure the strategy is 
return stacking. It’s been popularized by	2216.16	7.2
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	some people in Boston. There’s newfound research 
in Boston. There’s Resolve Asset Management in	2224.14	5.7
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Toronto. They have some funds around this. It’s 
not a new idea, but it’s a very good spin on it.	2229.84	5.76
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	As early as the 1980s, PIMCO came out with 
their stocks, plus was the name of the fund.	2236.62	5.257
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:32:41] Logan Kane: And this is still a great 
fund, but the idea is that you can use futures	2241.877	4.583
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to get exposure to stocks and well, you might 
only need 10% of your money downs, do that,	2246.46	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and then you get another 90 to play with. So you 
could put that in bonds, you could diversify,	2252.34	6.48
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you could do some commodities. There’s 
a lot of stuff you can.[00:33:00]	2258.82	3.36
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:33:00] Logan Kane: Now there’s ways to do this 
wrong and there’s ways to do this, right? Like	2262.18	5.58
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it wouldn’t really be return stacking 
if you just, I mean, you could do this,	2268.42	3.42
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you could just lever the S&P two to one, 
and you’d make a ton of money if it went up.	2271.84	4.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	But I think the most classic approach with this 
is to take that money and to put it into bonds.	2277.36	7.26
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:33:17] Logan Kane: Now for a kind of a neat 
tactic here, what you could do is you could	2284.62	5.28
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	invest in one of these funds and then you could 
just put the money in municipal bonds to get	2290.62	4.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	tax-free interest. So you get exposure to stocks, 
and then you get tax-free municipal bonds in one,	2294.94	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you, you gotta manage the risk here, but 
you should be able to handily beat the S&P	2299.62	4.8
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	by doing this because you have both stocks 
and bonds, they’re stacked on top of each.	2304.42	4.83
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:33:40] Logan Kane: Now I started 
to get into return stacking in 2021,	2309.25	4.47
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	kind of as a result of seeing how bad the expected 
returns for assets were. In the end. This didn’t	2315.16	9.24
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	this wasn’t the best time to be thinking about 
return stacking. The best play would’ve just	2324.94	3.84
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	been to sit in cash, but it was the right 
idea at the wrong time in my mind.[00:34:00]	2328.78	5.58
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:34:00] Rebecca Hotsko: So kind of walk us 
through why it broke down in 2021. Because I	2334.36	10.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	think what’s interesting about the strategy is 
that in normal times when stocks and bonds are	2344.68	7.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	not positively correlated, it can actually reduce 
volatility. Even though it’s a leveraged strategy,	2352.0	7.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you get higher returns for lower volatility, 
which almost seems like a free lunch.	2359.38	5.913
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:34:24] Rebecca Hotsko: 
It seems too good to be true,	2365.293	1.587
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	which it can be in some cases. 
And. What happened in 2021?	2366.88	5.72
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:34:32] Logan Kane: In late 2021, the strategy 
stopped working. I don’t want to say failed,	2372.6	8.62
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	because a lot of these funds are back 
to the prices they were in. 2020,	2381.22	3.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	everything went down. It didn’t matter whether 
you had stocks or bonds or international stocks,	2385.6	6.36
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	or preferred stock, or pretty much everything 
went down except for commodities which went up.	2391.96	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:34:52] Logan Kane: So if everything goes 
down, leverage is bad because there’s no way	2397.84	5.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to diversify if everything goes. But in the last 
two [00:35:00] bear markets in 2008, I guess we	2403.3	8.52
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	can call the Covid Dip a Bear Market in 2008, and 
then in 2000, this strategy was extremely helpful	2411.82	6.24
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to the point where you could about break even 
if you did it right, versus losing 50% or more.	2418.06	8.22
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:35:15] Logan Kane: Historically, concentration 
of risk inequities is more dangerous than leverage	2426.28	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	on a broad set of asset classes. In this case, 
meaning stocks, bonds, and commod. Stocks have	2432.16	5.94
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	gone down 50 plus percent a few times, and 
I think it’s, it’s more likely to happen now	2438.1	6.42
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	because the Fed seems to be more involved. That 
also became the problem with the return stacking.	2444.52	4.597
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:35:37] Logan Kane: I think we 
compared some of the policies to,	2449.117	3.383
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	like the policies where they put out every 
fire and like in the western US and Canada,	2452.5	4.74
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and then you can’t stop wildfires from happening 
this way forever. They just, they just happen	2457.24	7.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	later and they become worse when they do happen. 
The Fed, they can’t stop the business cycle.	2464.74	6.337
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:35:56] Logan Kane: And I think they’ve 
begun to realize that, that they shouldn’t	2471.077	3.863
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	just [00:36:00] peg interest rates at zero. 
It creates chaos and do massive qe because it,	2474.94	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but I mean, where we are now, I mean, if you 
have bond yields at three and a half percent	2480.76	4.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	on the 10 year and it’s more symmetrical, 
it could make money or you could lose money.	2485.08	6.517
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:36:13] Logan Kane: And I think bonds in 
some ways may be priced better than equities and	2491.597	4.643
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	commodities can offset some risks from. I might 
not be selling the strategy very well because of	2496.24	7.74
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the brutal performance in 2022. But I mean the 
research on this goes back a very long time. And	2503.98	7.02
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	in as much as 80% of the market environments, 
you’re going to do better if you lever,	2511.0	4.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	rather than you concentrate all your risk 
inequities over any given 10 year period.	2515.5	4.297
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:36:37] Logan Kane: I mean, the 
drawdowns will be longer with equities,	2519.797	4.223
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the worst drawdowns will generally be worse. It’s 
just outperforming, like the theory shows that	2524.02	6.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	your risk will increase by the square root of the 
amount of diversified investments you can make,	2530.98	4.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but your return will go up linearly. And 
Cliff Asmus was a big proponent of this.	2535.9	5.677
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:36:56] Logan Kane: He wrote a paper 
called Why Not 100% Equities? And what	2541.577	4.043
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	he [00:37:00] recommended was, anybody who’s 
considering going a hundred percent equity	2545.62	3.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	should also consider a leverage 60 40 
portfolio. And in that case you go 90, 60,	2549.58	7.26
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and this has been shown to outperform a hundred 
percent equity. So, I think probably the best	2556.84	5.34
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	way you could think about this is not just let’s, 
like take a ton of risk to try to hit long-term	2562.18	7.26
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	return targets, but rather just start with a 
more diversified portfolio and use leverage	2569.44	4.62
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to get your desired volatility rather than go 
all out just to try to hit a return target.	2574.06	5.917
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:37:29] Logan Kane: And by the way, it showed 
that it outperformed by about 1.52% per year,	2579.977	6.623
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the 90 60 versus the a hundred percent equit.	2586.6	4.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:37:37] Rebecca Hotsko: Yeah, that 
was so powerful when I read that and	2590.98	3.54
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I love Cliff’s work. He puts out exceptional 
research and he’s been doing it for so long,	2594.52	5.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and it’s just so interesting to think 
that, yeah, instead of going 100% equity,	2599.98	5.52
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	which I think a lot of investors are who 
are in their accumulation or growth phase,	2605.5	5.28
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	there’s actually a better way and you can get 
a higher [00:38:00] return for less volatility.	2610.78	5.073
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:38:02] Rebecca Hotsko: But not in these times. 
But nothing works in the current times we’re in.	2615.853	5.307
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	And so that’s where it’s run into trouble. And 
so you talk about a few different ways that	2621.16	6.06
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	investors can get exposure to this strategy in 
your article, so you talked about the PIMCO one,	2627.22	5.4
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and then there’s another ETF, NTSX. 
And so talk a little bit about the	2632.62	6.3
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	differences between those two because they 
implement the strategy a bit differently.	2638.92	3.397
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:38:27] Logan Kane: Okay, so the 
PIMCO fund is called PS Ldx. It’s a	2642.317	4.343
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	firecracker of a fund. I mean, it went up 
at a very high rate for a very long time,	2646.66	4.74
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and then since 20 20, 21, it’s come down a 
lot. It’s come down to early 2020 prices,	2652.06	6.0
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but this has created a lot of wealth over 
time. It’s basically a hundred hundred,	2659.2	3.54
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	so a hundred percent stocks and then a 
hundred percent long duration bonds on.	2662.74	4.14
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:38:49] Logan Kane: This fund is useful if 
you want to lever up. This fund is also useful	2666.88	5.28
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and with the idea of the return stacking here is 
if you want some exposure to stocks and bonds.	2673.36	5.4
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Let’s say I want, I want to go [00:39:00] 60 40 so 
I could get, if I could put some money in this and	2678.76	6.72
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I could get a lot of that exposure towards that 
60 40 without having to post all of that money.	2685.48	6.12
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:39:10] Logan Kane: It’s efficient in terms 
of capital. So you could do 30%, or I don’t know,	2692.74	4.74
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	20, 30% in this fund, and you’d get double the 
exposure per every dollar that you throw in. Now,	2697.48	6.18
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the reason why you would do this again is so that 
you can diversify the rest of your portfolio.	2703.66	3.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Commodities are a good 
thing to add to a portfolio.	2708.64	2.017
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:39:26] Logan Kane: The research 
shows that it’s kind of dead money to	2710.657	2.723
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	put money into commodities because you can’t 
maintain the same equity or bond exposure.	2713.38	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	But if you add a fund like this to your 
portfolio, even if just for a very small amount,	2719.2	4.02
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you can maintain your exposure to stocks and 
bonds, but you can also get some exposure to	2723.22	5.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	commodities which has been shown to 
hedge those two when they go down.	2728.32	2.7
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:39:45] Logan Kane: Like we said, there’s been 
right ways and wrong ways to execute this. NT SX	2731.02	5.34
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	is the other one you mentioned. NT SX is a lower 
octane version of this fund. It actually close	2736.36	6.12
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to follows the original Asmus paper. It’s 
90, 60 and the sixties and treasury future.	2742.48	6.24
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:40:00] The PSL DX is kind 
of the higher octane version.	2749.8	4.177
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:40:04] Logan Kane: NT SX is another good 
version that’s lower. It’s the 90 60 NT sx. Like	2753.977	6.743
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	if you really wanted to just do a two or three 
fund solution, you really could put a lot of money	2760.72	5.04
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	into NT SX without having to worry about risk 
management or anything because it’s not a super	2765.76	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	risky fund. It’s a good S&P 500 alternative that 
can free up money for some alternative stuff as.	2771.58	6.06
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:40:25] Logan Kane: You could go very low 
risk with this by adding municipal bonds,	2777.64	3.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	or you could use it to use your equity 
exposure. You could get some commodity	2781.54	3.3
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	exposure with this. It’s a good fund. It’s, 
it’s from Wisdom Tree Professor Jeremy Siegel.	2784.84	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	He’s on the board of of Wisdom Tree, and 
this fund was designed after Aspen’s work.	2791.98	5.257
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:40:42] Logan Kane: I think a lot of people 
are very down on financial theory after the last,	2797.237	4.703
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	after the last. Financial theory 
missed a lot of things due to the	2801.94	4.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Fed really making the fastest pivot in 
history from zero interest rates to now	2806.26	4.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	going all out to fight inflation. But going 
forward, this should be a good strategy.	2811.36	5.52
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:40:59] Logan Kane: [00:41:00] I, I think 
these strategies are very useful. And there’s one	2816.88	3.54
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	more fund, by the way, it’s called TYA. This is a 
classic strategy that takes advantage of treasury	2820.42	5.04
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	constraints. Basically, a lot of investors 
are forced to buy long duration treasuries,	2825.46	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	which makes intermediate treasuries have 
a better risk reward than long duration.	2831.28	4.117
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:41:16] Logan Kane: In almost all 
countries, in almost all time periods,	2835.397	2.663
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the intermediate is going to perform better 
than the long term. The exception that should	2838.06	5.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	be like if they picked interest rates to 
zero and you’re earning like half a percent	2843.16	3.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	in intermediate term bonds or so. You don’t want 
to add leverage on an asset that returns nothing,	2847.12	5.04
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but it works very well in environments like this.	2852.94	3.277
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:41:35] Logan Kane: If you can get intermediate 
term bonds in the right part of the yield curve,	2856.217	4.883
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you can kind of take advantage of the fact these 
long-term bonds tend to be a bit overpriced.	2861.1	4.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:41:45] Rebecca Hotsko: Hey, 
that was super helpful because yeah,	2865.48	2.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I think that was good pointing out that it’s 
not even just implemented stocks and bonds,	2868.3	4.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it can just be a pure bond fund as well.	2872.8	2.973
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:41:54] Rebecca Hotsko: So TYA was 
that. And I guess the other thing I	2875.773	4.287
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	just wanted to ask you [00:42:00] is in 
what case would someone be implementing	2880.06	4.98
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	this wrong? Because it’s leveraged 
exposure. Who might it not be Right for.	2885.04	5.76
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:42:09] Logan Kane: You don’t want to 
inadvertently take more risk than you’re	2892.3	3.72
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	comfortable with, which I think some people did.	2896.02	2.197
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:42:13] Logan Kane: With p s Ldx,	2898.217	1.103
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it’s a hundred hundred funds. So I think a lot of 
people saw, especially because PIMCO was paying	2900.4	4.44
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	a high dividend yield on the fund, I think people 
bid off a little more than they could chew because	2904.84	4.2
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it, it’s capable of, even in 2008 this fund went 
down a lot. I think people, they loved the 10,	2909.04	6.6
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	15% distributions when it was going up, but 
then they saw that leverage is two-sided.	2915.64	5.557
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:42:34] Logan Kane: In this case, it’s not 
going to sink you because it’s well diversified,	2921.197	4.463
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but you don’t want to take more risks than you 
need and you can track the risk in your portfolios	2925.66	6.18
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	by tracking the volatility. Longer term volatility 
scales pretty well with shorter term volatility,	2932.98	5.94
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	so you’ll get a lot of warning signs 
like your portfolio’s swinging too	2938.92	3.0
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	much and that you might not want 
to take as much risk as you are.	2941.92	3.78
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:42:54] Logan Kane: It’s not yet time to lever 
up on the stock market because I think we have a	2945.7	7.44
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	ways to go down. [00:43:00] But you know, if you 
get the 10 year treasury at 4.5%, if you get the	2953.14	6.36
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	S&P at 3,200 or maybe even below 3000 and you 
want to make that money back once you think we	2959.5	6.3
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	got a bottom. And once the volatility subsides 
a little bit, like once we have some signs of a	2965.8	4.8
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	bottom and the down trend is broken, you can make 
a lot of money really quickly and funds like this	2970.6	5.22
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and you can cover a lot of.	2977.02	1.14
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:43:21] Logan Kane: That’s fun to buy these 
wait for higher yields and lower stock prices.	2978.16	4.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	That was what I was	2985.72	0.933
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:43:26] Rebecca Hotsko: going 
to follow up with because it	2986.653	2.287
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	seems widely expected that the market still 
has farther to drop. We would expect that	2990.16	6.24
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	this fund has a lot more pain to come, but 
then on the bond side, that would act as,	2996.4	6.06
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	so the bond side would perform better 
perhaps when interest rates start to fall.	3002.46	4.353
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:43:44] Rebecca Hotsko: And then 
bond prices appreciate because,	3006.813	2.727
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	or is that the right way to 
think about the bond portion?	3009.54	3.08
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:43:51] Logan Kane: If we’re buying bonds, 
we want lower prices. If we’re selling ’em,	3012.62	6.58
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	we want higher prices. So it just depends 
on, on when you buy. I think with some of	3019.2	4.62
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	these strategies, I, I [00:44:00] think they’re 
going to be very useful and it’s good to know for	3023.82	3.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	like, on the be a better 
bull and be a better bear.	3028.98	2.58
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:44:05] Logan Kane: It’s good to know that 
these tools exist because they can help you	3031.56	3.3
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	express opinions in more efficient ways. And they, 
they can help you be more diversified. That’s the	3034.86	5.34
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	true inside of this. It’s not that, let’s use 
a bunch of leverage, try to beat the market, or	3040.2	5.04
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	let’s go all cash to try to time the market.	3045.84	2.137
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:44:20] Logan Kane: It’s good to know that 
these tools exist so that you can have a wider	3047.977	6.743
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	range of efficient tools that you can 
use for different market environments.	3055.68	4.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Then you can use these tactically to help you win.	3060.24	2.22
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:44:31] Rebecca Hotsko: And I guess 
the last thing I’ll ask you on this	3062.46	3.6
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	is that some leverage strategies 
when say they’re daily leveraged,	3066.06	4.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you can run into trouble if you 
hold them very, very long term.	3070.98	4.113
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:44:42] Rebecca Hotsko: And so is this more 
of a short term play or is this something that	3075.093	4.407
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	could potentially take a bit of your portfolio 
away from Disinvesting in a total S&P index?	3079.5	6.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:44:53] Logan Kane: Yes. The daily 
rebalancing funds are actually pretty	3086.4	5.22
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	interesting. I actually did some 
cool quant research on. [00:45:00]	3091.62	3.12
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	There’s a mathematical relationship between the 
return, the interest rate, and the volatility.	3096.66	6.163
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:45:05] Logan Kane: In these leverage funds, 
you can actually predict the prices of these	3102.823	4.097
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	leverage funds if you’re able to predict 
the volatility. But the long story short	3106.92	4.26
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	on the the leverage funds is that they’re 
dangerous, but they’re useful for trading.	3111.18	4.14
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	You can hold them long-term, but 
what you’re better off doing is just	3116.16	3.72
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	investing in funds like these because they’re not 
mechanically required to rebalance into down days.	3121.44	7.02
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:45:27] Logan Kane: It’s called volatility drag 
on these, and it’s actually kind of interesting	3128.46	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	because all of these leverage ETFs have to 
rebalance at the end of every day. They get picked	3133.14	5.16
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	off by the prop desks at the banks and hedge 
funds. Basically, imagine the S&P goes down 3%	3138.3	5.82
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	on Monday. These funds have to mechanically 
sell, I don’t know, billions of dollars in this.	3145.14	6.877
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:45:46] Logan Kane: And guess who’s going to 
take the other side? That’s obviously the banks.	3152.017	3.023
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	This will really blow your 
mind on the leverage funds,	3156.78	2.28
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	short leverage funds, right, and long 
leverage funds. So let’s say we got	3160.68	4.62
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	triple short S&P and we got triple long 
S&P. So at the end of [00:46:00] the day,	3165.3	4.92
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the short fund and the long fund, what you 
think the rebalancing would cancel out?	3170.22	5.497
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:46:05] Logan Kane: It’s a trick question.	3175.717	1.223
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	They actually don’t cancel out, and this is 
the key insight. They actually compound each	3179.58	4.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	other. The triple leverage short fund has to 
make the exact same rebalancing as the triple	3183.9	5.22
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	leverage. Long. So if it’s down, they sell 
to reset the leverage. If it’s up, they buy.	3189.12	4.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Now this obviously creates problems because 
people are, they think they’re betting on opposite	3194.34	5.28
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	things, but they’re actually betting on the same 
thing for this last half hour of the market.	3199.62	3.3
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:46:29] Logan Kane: And it creates a 
pretty decent wealth transfer based leverage	3202.92	4.86
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	ETFs to the prop desks and 
the banks and the hedge funds.	3207.78	3.6
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Now, the leverage ETFs where they’re 
useful is if volatility is really low,	3212.82	5.34
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you can make big returns. I think where they’re 
not useful is you can always beat them generally	3218.16	8.76
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	by using features or something where the 
rebalancing is discretionary rather than	3226.92	5.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	where the rebalancing is forced, because that, 
that’s just something to get picked off every day.	3232.02	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:46:57] Logan Kane: I don’t recommend 
the use of long of leverage [00:47:00] ETFs,	3236.7	3.84
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	long term daily rebalance leverage ecfs that 
now that’s distinct from funds that use the	3240.54	7.8
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	futures market to get moderate amounts 
of leverage. Those are fine. And there’s	3248.34	7.14
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	especially in the mutual funds, there’s 
often better risk management frameworks.	3256.38	5.017
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:47:15] Logan Kane: The leverage ETFs are 
kind of toys for people. They’re very popular	3261.397	3.683
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	on Reddit or to bet on big moves, but you’d be 
better off, especially in the options market,	3265.08	5.28
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and this is important. You’re better off 
buying more calls on the S P Y than you	3270.36	6.06
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	are buying calls on the leverage et tf 
because of this volatility drag thing.	3276.42	3.937
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:47:31] Logan Kane: And there’s actually some 
trading strategies that go around that. I know a	3280.357	3.623
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	hedge fund manager in Canada who does pretty well 
trading some of these anomalies. I was going to	3283.98	11.973
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:47:40] Rebecca Hotsko: ask you, why would 
someone implement this instead of just buying	3295.953	4.827
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	options? And I guess perhaps just because 
it’s easier, it’s already done for you.	3300.78	4.8
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:47:50] Logan Kane: Yeah, 
that’s the main reason it’s.	3305.58	3.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	Options. You really gotta know how they’re priced. 
For example, like if we were to use options on a	3310.92	5.64
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	stock and [00:48:00] if the average listener is 
not paying attention to the implied volatility	3316.56	5.76
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	or what’s going on in the options market, weird 
stuff happens all the time in the options market.	3322.32	5.437
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:48:07] Logan Kane: Well, the way stuff gets 
priced, it’s stuff will get priced strong. And	3327.757	4.103
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	then you don’t want to be on the wrong side 
of something that’s priced strong. But what’s	3331.86	4.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	what’s cool about the options market, and 
I think people would like some of this,	3336.36	4.2
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	is you can do some nice tactics with 
options like you can with future.	3340.56	3.757
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:48:21] Logan Kane: Like on heavily 
shorted stocks, you can use the options market	3344.317	3.803
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to, you can buy calls. Yeah, you buy 
calls and you sell puts, and you can	3348.78	5.16
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	earn the short borrower rate through the options 
market. Your broker won’t share this with you.	3353.94	4.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	For the most part, the best you can do is 
like get half of Fidelity or IB so you can	3359.34	4.44
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	earn the whole thing if you use the options 
if you buy some of these speculative stocks.	3363.78	3.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:48:41] Logan Kane: Conversely, 
if you want to short something,	3367.74	2.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you can use the options 
market to get a better deal.	3370.62	2.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	You can earn the cause when you short something, 
you get the cash rate, but you give the return of	3375.96	4.62
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the stock. So if your broker isn’t that nice, then 
they’re, they’re going to pocket a lot of the cash	3380.58	6.42
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	rate options and features are incredibly 
useful to get around some of these, like,	3387.0	6.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	get [00:49:00] around a lot of these antiquated 
like rules and just middlemen and stuff like that.	3393.96	5.077
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:49:03] Logan Kane: They’re 
very useful. Maybe we’ll have to	3399.037	3.656
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:49:06] Rebecca Hotsko: dive into some of those 
strategies in another episode because that is	3402.693	4.287
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	something I used to use options as more of a way 
to, I guess, get a lower cost basis for shares,	3406.98	7.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and so some OP strategies like that. But I would 
be very interested to learn more about those.	3414.66	5.553
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:49:22] Rebecca Hotsko: But the one last 
thing I wanted to ask you before I let you go	3420.213	3.867
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	today is on Bitcoin because last time we spoke 
FTX was just unfolding and nothing had really	3424.08	6.06
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	happened or hadn’t been solidified yet. And so you 
were talking about the Grayscale Bitcoin trust,	3430.14	6.3
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and I just wanted to follow up. On how you’re 
thinking about Bitcoin now after all of that	3436.44	5.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	unfolded and specifically even that ETF, 
because I remember you said it was perhaps	3441.9	6.18
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	largely determined on what happened because 
now maybe it might not be approved in the us	3448.74	5.4
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:49:55] Logan Kane: So 
that’s the last time we talked.	3454.14	3.96
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:49:57] Logan Kane: The crypto world 
has been a little off . [00:50:00] That’s,	3458.1	2.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	there’s been some drama in the crypto 
world. There’s more people in jail than	3460.56	4.38
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	there were during our last podcast. I, 
I guess some people are out on bail,	3464.94	3.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but grace. The best way to own Bitcoin, I 
believe, is the Grayscale Bitcoin trust.	3468.84	6.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	And this is tied to this fund that basically owns 
Bitcoin and Coinbase and it trades at a discount.	3475.74	7.477
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:50:20] Logan Kane: It got 
as bad as 50%, but now it’s 40.	3483.217	2.903
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	There’s an activist campaign underway, so there 
there’s, there’s two ways you can win here. The	3487.14	4.74
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	first is Grayscale, issuing the government 
to try to get them to allow a open-ended	3491.88	5.64
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	et t. This might work. It’s a little 
less likely to work since everybody	3497.52	3.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	seems to be under investigation or 
indicted already in the crypto world.	3501.42	3.337
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:50:40] Logan Kane: But I think it’s important 
that Bitcoin itself is blameless. Bitcoin did not	3504.757	7.763
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	hurt anyone. It did not steal anyone’s 
money. It’s actually a fantastic idea,	3512.52	3.66
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but a lot of hangers onS&People who just wanted to 
get in the crypto world to make a quick buck came	3516.72	6.3
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	in. I mean, 20,000 alt coins. It’s crazy. All 
this junk happened with [00:51:00] Crypto, but	3523.02	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	what we have here in Grace Skill, Bitcoin Trust is 
actually a very old school activist opportunity.	3528.9	4.597
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:51:05] Logan Kane: And basically you can 
win if Grace Gill is converted to an open-ended	3533.497	5.183
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	ETF, because the 40% discount will go to zero 
Mechanically, they can just redeem the shares and	3538.68	5.76
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	cash everybody out. And then there’s also another 
activist campaign by a guy named David Bailey.	3544.44	5.4
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	He’s the publisher of Bitcoin Magazine. He 
does not like the management of Grayscale,	3550.38	5.1
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and he is organizing a campaign to kick them out.	3555.48	2.7
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:51:29] Logan Kane: And in December, they 
had about 1% of those shares, and last I check,	3559.26	3.78
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	they had over 25. They’ve got some hedge funds 
involved. According to his Twitter, they’re	3563.04	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	completely inundated with calls and requests 
every day for people to pledge their shares	3568.92	4.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	because the idea is if you buy something 
for 60 cents on the dollar and you kick	3573.6	4.08
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the management out and redeem 
it for a hundred, life is good.	3577.68	2.4
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:51:49] Logan Kane: Also, Grayscale itself is 
trying to do a tender offer. Something’s going to	3580.08	5.76
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	happen. This discount is like, there’s a saying 
in physics that nature of bores with vacuum.	3585.84	6.42
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	So there’s a big vacuum here. So 
[00:52:00] something is going to	3593.04	2.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	happen to close this discount cause 
there’s so much money on the table.	3595.92	2.52
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	One way or another, I think Grayscale is going 
to be redeemed at a hundred cents on the dollar.	3599.82	5.373
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:52:08] Logan Kane: And all you have to 
do if you have any interest in Bitcoin at all	3605.193	3.927
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	is you buy this for about 60 cents in a dollar, 
and then if it goes to a hundred, you get	3609.84	5.04
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	a hundred. And I was way too early to this 
trade traded for a 20% discount in 2021,	3614.88	6.18
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	and we thought it was a great idea, and now it’s 
50. But it’s either your downside’s not so severe,	3621.06	7.98
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	because like I said, if there’s a hundred cents on 
the dollar worth of Bitcoin at Coinbase, and then	3629.04	7.68
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	you can buy it for 60, eventually something can 
always happen, which will always keep it value.	3636.72	4.117
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:52:39] Logan Kane: Or if you win, 
then you, you get the whole hundred.	3640.837	3.743
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	I think the downside is, is not so severe, but 
the upside is very clear, and crypto being the	3645.84	6.48
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	least efficient segment of the market. I think 
you get opportunities like this. Historically,	3652.32	6.24
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	there’s been a lot of opportunities like this in 
crypto, and I think this is another one of them.	3658.56	3.42
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:52:57] Logan Kane: We’ll 
see maybe next time I come on,	3661.98	3.0
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	if Grayscale is redeemed, we can 
take a victory lap. If it’s not, then	3664.98	4.32
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	we can do a postmortem, but I think 
the risk reward is quite good. Yeah,	3669.3	5.673
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:53:07] Rebecca Hotsko: it’s definitely 
interesting. And then I have been looking	3674.973	3.447
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	more into the Canadian ETFs, because we 
actually have a ton already in Canada.	3678.42	4.773
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:53:15] Rebecca Hotsko: And so there’s a lot 
of interesting ones in how they’re trading for	3683.193	3.627
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	a discount to their net asset value. So it 
does seem like a very efficient way to get	3686.82	5.22
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	exposure to Bitcoin, although you give up 
some of the things that maybe people like	3692.04	4.5
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	to buy Bitcoin for in the first place. You don’t 
hold the Bitcoin, it will never be your Bitcoin.	3696.54	4.473
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:53:32] Rebecca Hotsko: And so I guess 
that’s potentially a downside and maybe	3701.013	3.027
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it doesn’t. I don’t know. It just, maybe 
that’s one of the reasons people buy it	3705.12	4.14
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	in the first place, so it might 
go against some people’s values,	3709.26	2.7
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	but I find it’s quite a good deal 
if you want to get exposure to it.	3711.96	4.26
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:53:47] Logan Kane: Yeah, I mean if we can get 
a safe Bitcoin like trust and Grayscale is safe,	3716.22	6.0
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it’s just problematic because of the 
discount and because it’s a closed end fund.	3722.22	5.437
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:53:55] Logan Kane: I think that’s a great 
way for a lot of investors. There’s people	3727.657	2.723
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	who are Bitcoin maximalist who say, this is 
not what Bitcoin’s about. It’s like people,	3730.38	5.88
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	it’s the perfect parallel is gold. Like people,	3736.26	3.0
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	like why are you buying gold ETFs? Like 
when it hits the fan, like you want gold,	3739.26	6.48
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the gold in your house or at your business 
rather than at a bank or in an ETF.	3745.74	4.717
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:54:15] Logan Kane: So it’s a similar debate. 
I’m comfortable with Grayscale. I view the risk	3750.457	4.943
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	of something bad happening with Grayscale as low. 
It’s not FTX, but obviously people who are more	3755.4	5.76
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	on the side of the Bitcoin world 
where they want that control over,	3761.94	3.78
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	the Bitcoin keys. Then you 
obviously do it a different way.	3766.8	3.277
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:54:32] Logan Kane: You don’t, 
you don’t invest in an ETF.	3770.077	1.763
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:54:35] Rebecca Hotsko: Alright, so I 
think we’re going to end it here today. I	3772.44	4.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	want to thank you so much for coming back 
on, Logan. Could you remind our listeners	3777.0	4.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	where they can go to connect with you and 
learn more about everything that you do?	3781.56	3.9
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:54:47] Logan Kane: In the description here, 
we should have a link to Seeking Alpha, so you	3786.48	4.08
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	can get my work and hundreds of other authors for, 
I think right now we got a sale for $10 a month.	3790.56	4.56
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:54:55] Logan Kane: I encourage anybody 
who has any interest at all subscribe,	3795.96	2.46
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	support our mission, you’ll support our 
business. And then I also have a substack,	3799.02	3.84
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	which is my own, so anybody 
who wants to read some of my	3802.86	4.08
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	occasional work and musings and thoughts 
subscribe to that too. So that’s it.	3806.94	3.78
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:55:08] Rebecca Hotsko: Thank you so much.	3810.72	2.04
LGQRRiCJetg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQRRiCJetg	[00:55:10] Logan Kane: Absolutely.	3812.76	1.5
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Is on its way to one trillion dollars 
a year some estimates point to it being	0.0	3.9
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	maybe 1.3 trillion dollars every single 
year by 2030. memory chip gets sold into	3.9	7.44
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Data Centers more frequently than they do 
smartphones as early as next year on their	11.34	5.28
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	software business and they said it's 
in the hundreds of millions of dollars	16.62	3.06
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Welcome to the Millennial Investing Podcast. I’m 
your host, Rebecca Hotsko. And on today’s episode,	19.68	9.0
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	I’m joined by Nick Rossolillo. 
Welcome to the show, Nick.	28.68	3.66
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:02:18] Nicholas Rossolillo: Hey Rebecca. 
Thanks for having me on. Excited to do this.	32.34	3.6
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:02:21] Rebecca Hotsko: Thank 
you so much for coming on today.	35.94	2.52
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	I’ve been really interested in learning 
more about the semiconductor industry,	38.46	4.62
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	and as I was doing my research of who I 
should bring on, your name kept coming up.	43.08	4.053
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:02:36] Rebecca Hotsko: You have such a 
great YouTube channel, Chip Stock Investor,	47.133	3.507
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	which I’ve already learned a ton from, and 
so I’m really interested to know how long	50.64	5.58
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	have you been investing in chip stocks 
and how did you get interested in it?	56.22	3.66
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:02:52] Nicholas Rossolillo: 
Almost right from the get-go,	59.88	4.38
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	I started buying chip stocks when I started buying 
individual stocks like 17 years ago. In ’05, ’06,	64.26	8.52
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	a chip stock got added to my portfolio right 
off the bat. Uh, so at that time it was,	74.46	4.56
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	I bought a company called On Semiconductor, which 
I think we might talk a little bit about later.	79.56	5.7
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	That was my first pick. I 
had no idea what I was doing.	86.46	3.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	In hindsight, I should have bought something like 
Nvidia or Texas Instruments and just sat on it.	90.72	4.648
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:03:28] Nicholas Rossolillo: But I bought on 
Semi, which at the time was a very commoditized	95.368	3.932
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	manufacturer of power management chips. Yeah, 
I’ve been buying chip stocks for a while.	100.2	7.26
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	I’ve always been interested in electronics,	108.48	1.92
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	and so when I started investing, I 
got interested in semiconductors.	110.4	5.4
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:03:45] Rebecca Hotsko: Yeah. So I wanna dive 
into a ton of the stocks that you’re interested in	115.8	6.06
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	today, but first, I think it’d be super helpful 
to just go through an overview of the industry	121.86	5.04
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	as a whole because today our economy can kind of 
be described as a chip economy because microchips	126.9	5.4
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	have been applied to so many technological 
advancements and different industries.	132.3	4.353
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:04:04] Rebecca Hotsko: So can you 
walk us through a brief overview of the	136.653	3.447
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	semiconductor industry? How big of a market is 
it today, and which sectors use the most chips?	140.1	6.0
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:04:14] Nicholas Rossolillo: Yeah, it’s 
massive, and I think we’re at a really interesting	146.1	6.48
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	inflection point in the economy right now. 
So obviously, semiconductors are not new.	153.3	7.44
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	They were invented like 70 years ago, but we’re 
reaching this point in time where I think they’re	160.74	6.12
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	coming out of the office. Historically, 
you have maybe like an army of office	166.86	6.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	workers using computers and maybe they have some 
computing network shoved in a closet somewhere,	173.28	5.88
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	but we’re reaching this interesting point where 
both the power of the chip, or I should say the	179.94	6.84
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	computational power of the chip, is increasing 
to a point intersecting with the affordability	186.78	8.04
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	of that computing power where it now makes sense 
for all [00:05:00] sectors of the economy to start	194.82	7.5
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	using semiconductors. It makes sense for 
every sector, every industry, and again,	203.22	6.96
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	not just office workers using computers, using 
PCs, actually embedding those chips into daily	210.18	5.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	operations. So it could be an energy or a 
utility company. It could be a medical company	216.6	8.28
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	that wants to connect its medical equipment to 
a network. Obviously, electric vehicles and the	224.88	7.92
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	smartification of the car, of the cockpit, 
of the car. So all of these different things	237.3	5.82
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	kind of happen all at once, and the 
demand for chips is skyrocketing. So	243.12	5.82
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	I’ll throw some figures out here. Some 
pre-pandemic figures: 470 billion was the	250.5	7.14
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	global purchase of chips, the 
chips themselves, back in 2018,	258.9	4.68
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	and I start with 2018 because 2019 was actually a 
down year, if you remember the US-China trade war.	264.42	8.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	And fast forward today in 2022, global chip 
sales were just shy of 600 [00:06:00] billion.	274.92	6.06
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	So it’s a huge, huge market. That’s again, 
just the chips themselves, excluding a lot	281.94	6.06
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	of the software, a lot of the equipment, 
the raw materials, excluding all of that,	288.0	4.68
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	just the chips themselves, almost 600 billion, 
and it’s on its way to 1 trillion a year. Some	292.68	5.28
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	estimates point to it being maybe 1.3 
trillion every single year by 2030.	297.96	7.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:06:24] Nicholas Rossolillo: So if you’re 
looking for a growth industry for the next	304.98	3.6
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	seven, eight years, that’s a compound 
annual growth rate of seven to 10%,	308.58	5.52
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	depending on if you want to use the 1 trillion or 
the 1.3 trillion estimate. That’s a huge market.	314.1	7.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	So that’s broad. A broad overview. So you 
asked about end markets as well, didn’t you?”	322.14	9.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:06:48] Nicholas Rossolillo: “Yeah, for 
sure. You can get them to that. Yeah. You had,	331.56	4.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you had this chart here that was a really 
nice visual showing. Smartphones actually are	335.58	6.18
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	currently the largest market for semiconductors 
currently. Smartphones passed up to the PC last	341.76	5.7
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	decade as the largest consumer of chips. So again, 
remember office workers, historically the users of	347.46	6.18
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	computers, but then everybody became a user of a 
computer every single day, sometimes every minute	353.64	6.3
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	of every single day, depending on how addicted 
we are to our smartphone. But in the next decade,	359.94	7.62
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	I think there’s a growing anticipation that 
data centers will become the largest consumer	367.56	6.9
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	of semiconductors. So data centers being the 
main computing unit of the cloud. Of the cloud.	374.46	6.3
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	And there’s some different things we might 
get into later as to why that is, but	383.28	4.86
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	those are the biggest end markets. Currently, 
smartphones, PC, data centers, and servers.	388.86	6.96
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:07:47] Rebecca Hotsko: I wanna dig into the 
growth in, or the expected growth in sectors in	395.82	6.66
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	a second. I first wanna ask you about the 
different types of chips, because I think	402.48	5.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	that’ll help us grasp this overview of the 
industry. What are the main types of chips?	407.82	5.16
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:08:03] Nicholas Rossolillo: Basically there’s 
two broad types of chips, analog and digital.	412.98	8.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	So an analog chip, you can almost think 
of it as just basically a sensor. Maybe	421.86	5.28
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	if you want to compare it to how 
our bodies work. Our five senses,	427.14	4.38
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	an analog chip, is kind of like that. It might 
be a type of chip that reads a radio wave,	432.36	5.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	so that would be like a mobile 
device or it could be a power chip.	438.12	5.428
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:08:28] Nicholas Rossolillo: That somehow 
interacts with or alters the flow of electricity	443.548	3.992
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	through a computing system. It could be lidar 
or radar or a vision chip. A lot of new cars	447.54	7.56
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	are getting these to help enable some advanced 
driver systems. Or maybe it’s an industrial	455.1	5.94
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	robot that uses one of these analog chips. So 
again, just think of it like a sensor and kind	461.04	5.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	of like how our five senses help us interact 
with the world, the physical world around us.	466.8	4.768
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:08:53] Nicholas Rossolillo: That’s 
an analog chip for a computing system.	471.568	2.432
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	And then the second broad type of chip 
is a digital chip. And so a digital chip	475.32	6.36
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	works with ones and zeros. So you could 
compare these to like the brain, our brain.	482.58	5.94
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	And so within a digital chip you also have two 
basic types. You have logic and memory. So memory,	489.12	6.0
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	it stores information for later use.	496.86	2.008
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:09:14] Nicholas Rossolillo: And 
then logic, it crunches the numbers,	498.868	2.612
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	it’s figuring stuff out. And so the language 
that these things use are ones and zeros or bits,	502.14	6.6
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	and those are completely meaningless, but you 
have countless ones and zeros lined up together,	508.74	5.82
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	and that’s kind of like the most basic alphabet 
for software code. So, that’s a digital chip.	514.56	7.708
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:09:32] Nicholas Rossolillo: And oftentimes 
these are like the most recognizable names,	522.268	2.792
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	these digital chips. So like your Intel,	525.06	2.4
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	primarily a digital chip, a designer and 
manufacturer. Nvidia, AMD, both design digital.	528.3	7.62
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Micron is the top designer and manufacturer 
of memory chips in North America. So some very	537.84	9.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	name brand types of companies fall within 
this digital chip segment of the industry.	548.34	5.1
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:09:57] Rebecca Hotsko: And then, 
which of those two chips is the market	553.44	6.06
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	expected to grow the most? Like which has 
applications to, I guess, which industry?	559.5	4.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:10:06] Nicholas Rossolillo:	564.3	2.16
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	That’s an interesting question. So over the last 
decade, it has most definitely been the logic	566.46	6.48
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	chip, especially the digital logic chips. More 
so than memory. And memory’s kind of a different	572.94	9.0
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	topic I think we’ll touch on later. But Nvidia, 
now the world’s largest semiconductor company	583.38	9.18
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	as measured by market cap, had massive 
growth over the last decade from logic.	592.56	6.328
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:10:31] Nicholas Rossolillo: The world has this 
insatiable demand for these logic chips, and I	598.888	4.592
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	think the ChatGPT viral piece of software here the 
last few… kind of, I think illustrates it’s not	603.48	8.64
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	necessarily a new thing, but for the first time, 
I think a lot of consumers got introduced to AI	612.12	5.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	behind software like ChatGPT, which is	618.72	3.78
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	a computing system designed by Nvidia, or at least 
the heart of the system is designed by Nvidia.	623.22	5.968
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:11:00] Nicholas Rossolillo: So 
massive growth for those. But again,	629.188	2.672
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	we’re at an interesting inflection point in 
the economy now where for the next decade,	631.86	4.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	analog chips, which for a couple of decades now 
have been kind of a sleepy, commoditized part of	636.78	7.5
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	the semiconductor industry, are all of a sudden 
also expected to grow at a very, very fast pace.	644.28	6.448
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:11:23] Nicholas Rossolillo: And again, a lot 
of that is being driven by electric vehicles,	650.728	3.512
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	new automobile technology, 
and kind of parallel to that,	654.24	4.62
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	a lot of similar technology used in the modern car 
also getting applied to industrial robotics, so	658.86	6.54
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	manufacturing, food production, 
healthcare, and so on.	666.0	4.5
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:11:41] Rebecca Hotsko: Okay. That was 
very helpful because I found that when	670.5	6.9
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you first dive into researching chip 
companies, there is so much to learn	677.4	3.78
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	about how they work and which chip applies to 
what industry, which company makes what chip.	681.18	5.313
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:11:57] Rebecca Hotsko: And so I’m glad 
that you kind of broke that down for us today,	686.493	3.387
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	and I wanna dive into the expected 
growth of those different kinds of	689.88	4.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	sub-industries a bit more because 
yeah, I found that chart super	693.9	3.72
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	helpful to just see the growth. And so 
data centers are expected to actually	697.62	6.66
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	grow the most by 2030 and beat even smartphone 
demand, which I thought was super cool.	704.94	5.973
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:12:24] Rebecca Hotsko: And then 
automotive is expected to grow a ton as well.	710.913	3.387
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	And then personal computing a little 
bit, and what was the other one there?	715.38	3.96
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:12:34] Nicholas Rossolillo: Automotive. 
Yeah. Consumer electronics. Decent growth	722.04	4.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	over the next decade. I mean, a market 
doubling in size over the next eight years is	726.24	4.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	pretty impressive. But kind of one 
of the sleepier parts of the market.	731.76	4.98
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:12:46] Nicholas Rossolillo: So 
yeah, pc, consumer electronics and	738.06	3.54
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	internet service infrastructure, kind of 
the slowest moving parts of this industry.	741.6	6.813
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:12:56] Rebecca Hotsko: Right. 
So then that data centers one,	748.413	2.907
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you kind of touched on that. That is 
driven then by AI demand essentially?	751.32	4.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:13:04] Nicholas Rossolillo: It’s 
become twofold. So over the last decade,	757.86	4.44
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	it’s been just general-purpose cloud computing, 
or oftentimes you’ll hear it referred to as	762.3	6.78
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	HPC (high-performance computing). So these 
massive data centers operate huge applications,	769.08	8.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	like Meta. The parent company for Facebook and 
Instagram operates massive data centers. I think	778.86	6.78
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	this is actually a little-known fact, but Meta is 
not just a social media app. They actually do some	785.64	7.14
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	really deep impressive engineering behind the 
scenes because they own their own data centers.	792.78	4.888
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:13:36] Nicholas Rossolillo: And to operate 
something that can support 3 billion plus users	797.668	5.732
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	around the world, with people using it 
constantly, every second of every place	804.6	5.7
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	on the globe, you have to have some massive 
infrastructure. So over the last decade,	811.14	5.94
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	it was just the general-purpose 
cloud. But now, all of a sudden,	817.08	3.48
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	it’s AI, which oftentimes is just getting 
embedded into the cloud somewhere.	821.28	6.688
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:14:02] Nicholas Rossolillo: So yeah, that 
data center market, I think it’s going to	827.968	3.572
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	actually surpass. Some estimates still think the 
smartphone market will be the largest consumer	831.54	4.92
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	of chips by the end of this decade. I really 
firmly believe that data centers and servers,	836.46	7.38
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	maybe like we could break that down further into 
public cloud like Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure,	845.58	7.26
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	and then also companies building their own 
private cloud network as well, their own	852.84	4.74
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	data center-based network for personal use.	858.18	2.608
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:14:33] Nicholas Rossolillo: Those two things 
combined, I think, will outpace smartphones	860.788	4.532
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	in the next, by the end of this decade. Some 
estimates are actually pointing that memory chip	865.32	5.7
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	demand will actually get sold into data centers 
more frequently than they do smartphones as early	872.1	8.4
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	as next year, as early as 2024. And then Logic 
chips, digital logic chips will catch up and,	880.5	7.92
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	in total, surpass smartphones.	890.04	2.04
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:14:59] Rebecca Hotsko:	892.08	1.74
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Wow. And so, okay, so the main chips for data 
centers are memory and logic you just said.	893.82	7.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:15:07] Nicholas Rossolillo: Correct. Yes, 
data centers are primarily logic chip-driven.	901.02	7.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	So you have all this information flooding into 
these remote locations. You know that maybe	908.04	6.18
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	there’s one somewhere in central DC, central 
Washington, central Oregon in the Northwest.	914.22	7.62
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	You have all this massive information flooding 
into these things from the internet or maybe	923.22	6.24
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	from a company’s private network. So again, 
it’s like the central nervous system. If you	929.46	6.3
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	want to compare a computing system to the 
human body, there is so much information	935.76	4.74
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	flooding these things, and that massive 
amount of data is only getting larger.	940.5	5.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:15:45] Nicholas Rossolillo: As more devices 
get connected, more people get connected to these	945.84	4.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	complex software systems and AI algorithms and 
whatnot, a massive amount of demand is now coming	950.64	7.62
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	from things like AI, and that’s all going 
to happen in a data center somewhere.	959.16	5.22
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:16:01] Rebecca Hotsko: Okay, so 
now I wanna get into your top pick.	964.38	5.313
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:16:05] Rebecca Hotsko: And we talked about 
this before the episode, it might be helpful to	969.693	3.627
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	break it down kind of by sub industries. So let’s 
start with cloud AI. Who do you think has the,	973.32	7.32
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	or which companies do you think offer the 
best long-term prospects in this sub-industry?	980.64	4.68
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:16:20] Nicholas Rossolillo: One of 
them, I’ve already mentioned, is Nvidia,	985.32	5.22
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	which in recent years I think has become a 
lot of people’s favorite semiconductor stock,	990.54	5.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	hopefully because the business is awesome and not 
just because the stock price has rocketed higher,	995.88	6.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	but I think that is the top pick and 
the market has really caught onto it.	1003.02	6.568
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:16:42] Nicholas Rossolillo: So even though by 
revenue, actual sales, Nvidia is not the world’s	1009.588	6.092
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	largest semiconductor company, it is, however, the 
largest semiconductor company by market cap. And	1015.68	7.86
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	again, it’s just being driven by this expectation 
that the data center and how much information	1023.54	8.46
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	needs to be crunched by these data centers is 
going to soar over the next five to 10 years.	1032.0	7.048
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:17:07] Nicholas Rossolillo: And Nvidia has 
built itself as not just a platform company,	1039.048	4.532
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	it’s another big tech company. Like 
we can think of Google or Amazon as a	1045.38	5.04
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	platform business that other businesses build 
themselves on top of. Nvidia is kind of that	1050.42	6.12
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	type of company now. It’s that important in the 
global economy. So as AI takes off, Nvidia has the	1057.08	8.88
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	market cornered. If you’re looking to build 
an AI system, you almost, almost – keyword	1065.96	7.08
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	“almost” – can’t design an AI system without 
Nvidia being somewhere in the mix at some point.	1073.04	7.44
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:17:43] Nicholas Rossolillo: So I think 
that’s the top pick. Expensive stock,	1080.48	5.7
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	ridiculously expensive stock, and it’s just 
because of this expectation that they’re going to	1086.18	6.84
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	gobble up the most of this market in the next five 
to 10 years. So I have a [00:18:00] trio of them,	1093.02	8.46
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	though, that make up my top pick here in data 
center and AI: AMD, again, a household name in	1101.48	7.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	years past, kind of the underdog to Intel, but 
they’ve really passed up Intel technologically	1109.28	5.04
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	in recent years. And then a third one that almost 
no one has heard of – Marvell Technology Group.	1114.98	7.348
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:18:21] Nicholas Rossolillo: So this 
company makes a type of processor called	1122.328	4.772
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	ADPU – a Data Processing Unit – and they made a 
string of acquisitions in the last four or five	1127.1	8.82
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	years to bolster their portfolio of different 
chip designs and IP that they can license out.	1135.92	8.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	And so they’re actually a key company when a 
company is trying to design high-performance	1144.68	6.12
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	computing for the data center. Marvell is 
a key ingredient in that work now as well.	1150.8	6.9
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:18:50] Rebecca Hotsko: Okay. I wanna jump 
back to NVIDIA for a second because I’m wondering,	1157.7	5.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you said they kind of have the market cornered. 
Why is that? What is their competitive advantage	1163.04	5.22
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	that no other chip company can do or maybe 
are they trying to do and have failed?	1168.26	4.62
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:19:06] Nicholas Rossolillo: Actually, 
so we’re recording this a day after NVIDIA’s	1174.98	5.4
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	last earnings report. And on the earnings call 
yesterday, an analyst asked CEO, Jensen Wong,	1180.38	8.88
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	that question precisely, and he pointed out, you 
know, they do in fact have competition. They’ve	1189.26	5.82
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	always had competition. NVIDIA’s secret ingredient 
is the GPU, the graphics processing unit, which	1195.08	7.98
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	historically is for high-end video game graphics 
on a PC or laptop. They’ve figured out though,	1204.08	8.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	years ago, that the technology that their 
chips utilize can also be used as a computing	1212.84	9.6
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	accelerator. So a CPU, which in times past was 
dominated, a type of chip dominated by Intel,	1222.44	9.78
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	has its limits as far as what it can handle when 
it comes to these really, really complex pieces	1232.22	5.94
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	of software where there’s massive amounts of data. 
The CPU can only process so much of that data so	1238.16	7.68
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	fast, but the way the GPU is designed is it can 
kind of chop up this massive amount of data into	1245.84	5.64
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	smaller pieces and then process it in multiple 
threads all at once. And so it’s being used as a	1251.48	8.1
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	computing accelerator. You still need a CPU 
in a data center. But let’s say if you want to	1261.68	7.62
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	run an application, like let’s say chat, GPT, 
and it’s been trained on this incredibly huge	1269.3	7.26
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	set of information on the internet, let’s say 
general information found on the internet.	1277.22	5.52
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	You can’t just use CPUs, you have to use a GPU. 
And NVIDIA has been working on these things now	1284.54	4.92
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	for decades. And they’re way, way far ahead. 
Both AMD has GPUs and they’re also far ahead	1289.46	10.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Intel technologically on these GPUs.	1300.2	2.58
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:20:54] Rebecca Hotsko: Okay, 
and so what happened to Intel,	1302.78	5.16
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	because I think I heard on one of your YouTube 
videos that they just kind of became complacent,	1307.94	5.46
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	but could you explain what happened 
with them and why aren’t they farther?	1314.12	3.48
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:21:07] Nicholas Rossolillo: I 
promise I won’t rant about Intel	1317.6	6.12
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	like I have on my YouTube channel. 
Intel’s problems really go back.	1323.72	5.4
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	I think we can go back a couple of decades if 
we really want to trace Intel’s problems today	1330.26	6.72
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	to the root source. So back in the early two 
thousands, a small company called Apple was	1338.06	7.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	working on this quaint little device called 
an iPhone, and they approached Intel and	1345.26	7.14
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	asked for help in designing a chip for it, and 
Intel took a pass. They said, you know, basically	1353.84	6.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	that’s a neat little device, but that’s not what 
we do. And so Intel completely missed the boat on	1360.26	8.52
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	mobile computing technology, logic chips, 
digital logic. They completely missed	1369.38	5.1
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	the smartphone market. And so they really kind of 
pigeonholed themselves basically in CPUs, which	1375.56	7.26
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	is one of the original types of logic chips. And 
they got pigeonholed in PCs and laptops and some	1382.82	7.62
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	data centers, CPUs. But again, as we just talked 
about, as these data centers get more complex	1390.44	7.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	and the software that needs to be run by them 
gets more complex, NVIDIA is actually ahead	1398.18	6.48
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	of all of these data centers. Data center 
operators say, “Hey, we need new equipment	1405.38	5.28
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	to run an AI algorithm.” They’re not going 
to Intel for the stuff they’re going to	1411.68	5.88
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Nvidia. So Nvidia kind of helped create this 
market as well. So Intel has missed multiple	1417.56	5.46
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	shifts in computing technology. There are some 
other issues going on as well where I think they	1423.92	8.64
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	could have turned things around earlier, but 
they were just lazy. They got complacent and	1434.54	4.44
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	after the handwriting was on the wall that 
the industry had shifted towards mobile and	1439.64	4.92
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	then later on cloud, they weren’t quick 
enough to get up to speed with the times.	1444.56	5.88
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:23:05] Rebecca Hotsko: Okay. That is 
very interesting. I guess it just speaks	1450.44	4.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	to management and I guess why good 
management is so important as always.	1454.64	4.169
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:23:12] Rebecca Hotsko: And I wanna jump back 
to NVIDIA now for a second because, okay. Their	1458.809	4.171
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	competitive advantage, you mentioned they are 
just far ahead in the G P U technology and so,	1462.98	6.18
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	so there are a couple competitors though, catching 
up. How strong is that moat, would you say?	1470.12	5.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:23:28] Nicholas Rossolillo: For Nvidia, 
I think at this point it’s pretty strong.	1475.88	7.38
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:23:32] Nicholas Rossolillo: An 
interesting thing about Nvidia is	1484.04	2.22
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	it’s not just a semiconductor company 
anymore. They’re also a software company,	1486.98	4.5
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	but maybe not the type of software 
that we might think of. I think	1492.8	3.54
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	we’ve all gotten hooked on software as 
a service (SaaS) over the last decade.	1496.34	7.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	AI requires high-performance computing and 
AI often requires a highly customized piece	1504.74	8.1
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	of software. It might be dedicated specifically 
to a business or maybe a specific segment within	1512.84	7.74
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	a business. There is no one-size-fits-all, 
and so Nvidia has done a fantastic job over	1520.58	6.12
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	the last couple of decades now developing this 
software that makes its chips, its GPUs, usable	1528.08	8.7
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	for the user for the individual 
or the company that’s buying them.	1537.38	4.228
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:24:19] Nicholas Rossolillo: So they have 
this very wide portfolio of software. Now,	1541.608	3.812
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	oftentimes that software is bundled together 
and given away for free with the GPU itself,	1545.42	6.48
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	but increasingly in the last few years they 
have been branching off into more advanced	1552.98	5.46
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	software that they can actually charge 
for. So again, in the last earnings call,	1558.44	6.36
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	just yesterday, they actually gave the most 
solid quantitative number to date on their	1565.64	8.4
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	software business, and they said it’s 
in the hundreds of millions of dollars.	1574.04	3.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	So that’s super non-specific. I don’t know if that 
means 200 million or if it’s closer to 1 billion	1577.46	5.1
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	in software revenue, but it’s becoming a 
very significant part of their company.	1583.64	4.08
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:25:04] Nicholas Rossolillo: And when you 
combine two things together like that very	1587.72	5.7
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	well-entrenched hardware that’s very far ahead of 
its peers technologically with a software business	1593.42	6.9
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	that makes it very easy for customers to 
implement that hardware and put it to use	1601.28	5.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	as quickly as possible in their day-to-day 
operations, you now all of a sudden have a	1606.62	4.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	company that is going to be very difficult to 
uproot from the very fabric of the economy.	1610.64	7.108
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:25:33] Nicholas Rossolillo: 
So I think Nvidia has a very,	1617.748	2.432
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	very strong moat at this point, and that’s 
reflected obviously in the sky-high valuation	1620.18	4.62
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	one-year forward earnings expectations 
of well over 40. That’s a very, very	1626.24	7.56
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	high price, even for a semiconductor 
company growing as fast as they are.	1634.82	4.56
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:25:51] Rebecca Hotsko: What is your 
view on the current valuation then today?	1639.38	5.853
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:25:54] Rebecca Hotsko: Because I think anyone 
listening and if they do their own research, could	1645.233	3.387
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	see that growth story and those prospects. But 
at the end of the day, if you pay too high of a	1648.62	4.98
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	price and that eats away your return, and so what 
do you think of the current price and valuation?	1653.6	5.16
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:26:08] Nicholas Rossolillo:	1658.76	3.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	I’m sure you have a diverse base of listeners, so 
if someone’s looking for a quick trade to profit	1662.18	7.74
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	off of Nvidia is probably not what you’re looking 
for, but if you expect to be a business owner,	1669.92	6.54
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you wanna own Nvidia stock like it’s, 
it’s your business for the long term.	1677.36	4.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:26:25] Nicholas Rossolillo: I think a dollar 
cost averaging plan still makes sense even at this	1682.88	4.56
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	point. There’s definitely gonna be some volatility 
this year because of that high valuation.	1687.44	5.4
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	A lot of growth is already baked into 
the price. But if you’re looking five,	1693.62	3.84
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	10 years down the road and even beyond 
that, this company has a ton of potential.	1697.46	5.28
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:26:44] Rebecca Hotsko: Now I wanna 
move on to mobility, because this is	1702.74	5.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	a sector that a lot of our listeners 
probably know well. So who are the top	1708.68	4.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	leaders in this space, and who do you think 
has the best chance for our performance?	1713.48	4.26
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:26:57] Nicholas Rossolillo: So old sleepy 
Qualcomm, I think is the obvious place to start	1717.74	7.32
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	here, right? This is almost as close as we’ll 
get to a monopoly in the technology industry.	1725.06	8.188
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:27:09] Nicholas Rossolillo: So Qualcomm has 
deep roots. The business was founded on mobile	1733.248	6.392
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	technology. In fact, it has two basic segments in 
which they report their financials. One of them	1739.64	7.68
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	is called QTL, Qualcomm Technology Licensing. 
It generates upwards of one and a half billion	1747.32	8.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	dollars in revenue every single quarter 
and generates earnings before tax over 70%.	1756.08	5.4
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:27:32] Nicholas Rossolillo: And this 
is just patents that they license out to	1761.48	4.92
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	companies that want to use Qualcomm’s mobile 
technology, which there’s not a lot of other	1766.4	6.24
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	places, AI or alternatives that you can go to. 
And so Qualcomm has this great baseline business	1772.64	7.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	that’s incredibly profitable, incredibly stable, 
and so I think this is a good place to start.	1780.68	6.508
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:27:55] Nicholas Rossolillo: Then they have 
this other segment, QCT, Qualcomm CDMA technology.	1787.188	6.092
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	That’s basically the chips. They design chips, and 
then when that chip gets sold primarily into an	1793.28	6.78
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Android phone, they make some money off of that 
sale. So, smartphones, tablets, even some PCs,	1800.06	13.14
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Qualcomm is doing a lot of work to get more 
of a presence in the PC and laptop segment.	1813.2	7.08
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:28:19] Nicholas Rossolillo: 
There’s a really good chance,	1820.28	2.88
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	be it Android or currently anyways, 
for the time being, an Apple iPhone,	1823.94	4.98
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you’re gonna have a Qualcomm chip, 
some Qualcomm circuitry in there.	1829.94	4.74
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:28:31] Rebecca Hotsko: 
Interesting because I thought that	1834.68	2.52
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Apple specifically was one of 
the largest customers for TSM.	1839.24	4.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:28:38] Nicholas Rossolillo: Yes. This 
is where I think maybe, so we recently put	1843.26	11.22
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	together a semiconductor industry flow chart, 
and maybe I should mention that and we can	1854.48	6.78
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	share that here, because it’s a complicated web 
of different companies and different suppliers.	1861.92	6.66
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:28:54] Nicholas Rossolillo: So Apple designs 
its own chips using a company called Arm Holding.	1868.58	7.38
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Currently, ARM is a subsidiary of SoftBank 
in Japan. SoftBank bought it back in 2016,	1875.96	7.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	so Apple purchases the patent 
or licenses, I should say,	1884.54	5.28
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	the patent from Arm to design its processors for 
its iPhones, its iPads, and now also the MacBook.	1889.82	8.068
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:29:16] Nicholas Rossolillo: 
So if you have a MacBook	1897.888	2.732
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	or a MacBook Pro with an M1 or now an M2 chip in 
it, that’s powered by ARM, and it’s a different	1901.34	6.48
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	business model. So Apple basically buys 
the license and the rights to the A-chip	1909.5	4.38
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	patent. They customize it to their needs, 
and then once they’re done designing it,	1913.88	4.44
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	they send it over to TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor 
Manufacturing) to actually have the chip made.	1918.32	7.44
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:29:45] Rebecca Hotsko: Yeah, that 
was super helpful because I wanna ask	1927.8	4.56
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you about Taiwan Semiconductor, where it kind 
of falls on your list and your thinking. It	1932.36	5.58
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	got quite popular when Berkshire bought it and 
I think among the value investing community,	1937.94	4.38
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	and then they later sold it. So I’m 
wondering what your thoughts are on TSM.	1942.32	6.0
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:30:04] Nicholas Rossolillo: Yeah, we should 
definitely start with Warren Buffet and Berkshire	1948.32	5.94
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Hathaway buying $4 billion worth of TSMC, 
and then a mere three months later, they sold	1954.26	8.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	86% of the stake that he just purchased. 
It’s a fantastic company. I will say that	1964.82	6.66
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	it’s a wonderful company. 
They actually port Intel.	1971.48	3.9
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:30:24] Nicholas Rossolillo: I think this just 
kind of illustrates how far behind they are. TSMC	1975.98	4.68
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	passed Intel years ago as far as manufacturing 
technology capabilities. So, Intel has lost its	1980.66	8.22
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	lead in designing chips. AMD has passed them up 
on multiple fronts in designing the chips. And	1988.88	6.6
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	then Taiwan Semiconductor has surpassed Intel in 
manufacturing technology, and they’ve manufactured	1995.48	53.46
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	a majority of the world’s most advanced chips, 
for smartphones and data centers primarily.	2048.94	5.58
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:30:53] Nicholas Rossolillo: So, TSMC is a 
wonderful business. I think Berkshire Hathaway	2054.52	5.16
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	ended up with $4 billion of this in its 
portfolio, not because of Warren Buffet,	2061.66	5.04
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	definitely not Charlie. I think it was Todd 
Combs and Ted Wesley that more than likely	2066.7	7.32
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	made this purchase in the third 
quarter, basically summer 2022. And then	2074.8	6.66
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	a colleague of mine, Billy 
Duberstein, pointed this out.	2084.22	3.208
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:31:18] Nicholas Rossolillo: He was listening 
to Charlie Munger at the Daily Journal annual	2087.428	5.192
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	meeting in mid-February, and Charlie Munger 
hinted at why they probably invested.	2092.62	5.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Munger basically said he 
hates businesses like TSMC,	2099.34	4.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	his words, he hates them because 
to stay ahead of your competitors,	2104.14	6.96
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you’re constantly having to take your profits 
and reinvest them to develop new technology.	2111.1	6.208
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:31:40] Nicholas Rossolillo: So, instead of 
getting most of the profits back as a shareholder,	2117.308	3.932
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you’re left with a fraction of the profits 
because most of the profits get reinvested	2121.24	5.52
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	to buy new equipment and develop new tech.	2127.6	2.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:31:54] Rebecca Hotsko: That will 
never change over time. Then essentially.	2130.36	3.48
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:31:59] Nicholas Rossolillo:	2133.84	3.06
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Probably not. If we maybe say like, the 
human brain is the gold standard of computing	2136.9	7.86
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	efficiency. You know, you eat food, and our 
brains can do absolutely wonderful things with	2144.76	7.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	very minimal amounts of energy. Yes, computing 
technology will always have room for improvement.	2151.96	5.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	And then, of course, there’s this whole 
quantum computing thing that is probably	2160.12	4.32
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	still more than a decade away from being 
an actual commercially viable thing.	2164.44	4.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:32:27] Nicholas Rossolillo: So, there’s 
that too that will change the game. And	2169.24	4.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you have this constant necessity to keep 
funneling money into capital expenditures.	2174.04	6.3
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	The machines needed to manufacture chips cost tens 
of millions, if not hundreds of millions of bucks.	2181.12	5.88
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	It’s just a never-ending cycle. So, TSM 
is an absolutely wonderful business,	2189.16	4.86
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	but I think a lot of investors should 
really understand that level of capital	2194.02	5.58
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	intensity needed for the company 
to remain a wonderful business.	2199.6	4.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:32:57] Nicholas Rossolillo: It’s 
not an easy industry to participate in.	2204.76	2.58
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:33:01] Rebecca Hotsko: And so will 
their main growth then going forward,	2207.34	4.38
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	be in smartphones then too for TSM? Or are they	2211.72	4.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	branching out and will they gain market 
share in those other growing industries?	2216.52	3.66
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:33:13] Nicholas Rossolillo: It will be 
a smartphone, as well as a data center and	2220.18	5.88
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	AI-based business. They will get growth from both 
of those industries. They have begun expanding the	2226.06	10.08
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	facilities that they already broke ground on, 
I guess in Arizona. They’re building some new	2236.14	5.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	fabs in Arizona, and Tesla has apparently secured 
some supply from TSMC, but that’s probably more	2241.48	7.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	than likely the logic ship itself, not the 
analog chip. TSMC does not dabble in analog.	2249.28	6.928
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:33:43] Nicholas Rossolillo: They are 
a digital chip specialist, so kind of like	2256.208	4.832
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	the brains of the modern vehicle. That’s probably 
an area they could get some growth from as well.	2261.04	5.433
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:33:54] Rebecca Hotsko: Okay,	2266.473	0.747
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	so they aren’t directly competing with 
Nvidia for that market share then?	2267.22	4.26
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:34:00] Nicholas Rossolillo: Yeah, that’s a 
good question. Nvidia is a customer, as is AMD.	2271.48	6.54
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Basically, anyone who is a digital chip 
designer is more than likely a TSMC customer.	2279.28	8.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Intel wants to compete in this market, so 
currently, TSMC and Samsung are the two	2292.24	7.14
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	biggest third-party foundries. So, if you design a 
chip, you’re basically going to one of those two,	2299.38	5.82
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	TSMC or Samsung. The problem with Samsung is that 
they also manufacture chips for themselves. So, if	2305.74	9.06
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you have a smartphone chip design and you hand it 
over to Samsung, who also designs and manufactures	2314.8	8.82
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	their own smartphone chips, you have a bit of 
a conflict of interest there. TSMC is unique	2323.62	6.18
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	because they are the only third-party foundry 
that does not compete with their customers.	2329.8	5.04
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	They only manufacture, so this is a 
market Intel wants to get into. But,	2336.04	4.74
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	again, they will also have that issue 
where they design their own chips. So,	2340.78	4.68
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	anyone who gives a design to Intel to manufacture 
for them will have a built-in competitor there.	2346.12	5.733
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:35:08] Rebecca Hotsko: Right. So 
TSM seems like they have a pretty strong	2351.853	5.007
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	competitive moat and it would take a lot to 
catch up with them and many years at least,	2356.86	6.0
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	even for someone as big as Intel to even 
catch up to what they’re already doing.	2362.86	4.293
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:35:22] Rebecca Hotsko: So what are your 
thoughts on its current valuation right now,	2367.153	4.047
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	and I guess long-term prospects?	2371.2	2.04
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:35:29] Nicholas Rossolillo: I think it 
is a decent value based on what I can see.	2373.24	7.86
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	There is an expected rebound, so currently, 
we’re in the midst of a slump of chip demand,	2383.62	6.84
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	especially for logic chips, digital 
chips for PCs and smartphones,	2390.46	7.5
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	which is a substantial part of TSMC’s business. 
However, I still think it’s a decent value because	2399.4	5.58
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	there’s an expectation that the market 
will recover in the second half of 2022.	2404.98	4.68
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:35:57] Rebecca Hotsko:	2409.66	1.5
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Right. Yeah. It seemed like a few companies 
communicated in their guidance that they think	2411.16	5.1
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	the first half of the year is gonna be bad, and 
then they said the second half will be rosy.	2416.26	4.26
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:36:06] Rebecca Hotsko: I guess in 
terms of near term risks to valuations,	2421.6	3.96
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	who do you see these short term 
headwinds affecting the most?	2425.56	3.84
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:36:15] Nicholas Rossolillo: The 
semiconductor industry is a peculiar place,	2429.4	6.66
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	as it is very forward-thinking. If we 
assume that the market tries to incorporate	2436.78	8.28
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	information three to six months, or perhaps 
a year, in advance when calculating a fair	2445.06	8.46
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	stock price, then the semiconductor market 
operates on a six- to twelve-month or longer	2454.54	3.96
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	timeframe. As such, when the bear market began 
in 2022, semiconductor investors were already	2459.64	7.32
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	anticipating the outlook for 2023 and the looming 
decrease in demand for PCs and smartphones,	2472.18	6.96
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	a year or more in advance. Consequently, many of 
the current economic and semiconductor-related	2479.14	9.66
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	issues are already reflected in the share price. 
Therefore, rather than considering what could go	2488.8	8.16
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	wrong, the focus now is on what could potentially 
hinder or delay the recovery of the chip industry.	2496.96	5.7
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:37:05] Nicholas Rossolillo: One 
area that is especially vulnerable is	2502.66	7.92
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	memory chips. Memory is highly 
price-elastic in logic memory.	2511.12	5.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	The price of a memory chip, which is a 
fundamental commodity in computing systems,	2519.52	4.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	will fluctuate dramatically depending on the 
market’s supply and demand. With the current	2527.44	9.18
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	slump in PC and smartphone demand, 
and firms trying to reduce supply,	2536.62	7.14
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	memory chip companies have been severely impacted. 
Micron, for example, has been hit hard. However,	2546.64	6.24
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	if the market becomes aware of a delay in the 
overall chip industry, it is the memory market	2552.88	8.88
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	that is likely to be the most susceptible 
and will detect any issues the soonest.	2561.76	7.26
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:37:46] Rebecca Hotsko: That makes a lot 
of sense. I forgot to ask you about two more	2569.02	5.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	industries, and I wanna get to that before we talk 
about more, I guess the relative valuation of all	2574.36	6.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	these stocks, I wanna make sure we have them 
all covered. First, is the automotive industry,	2580.78	4.5
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	because you mentioned how that’s supposed to 
be a growing industry with electric vehicles.	2585.28	4.053
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:38:04] Rebecca Hotsko: So which companies are	2589.333	1.947
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	expected to gain the most 
traction in this industry?	2591.28	3.3
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:38:10] Nicholas Rossolillo: The obvious 
pick here is Texas Instruments, probably the	2594.58	6.24
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	stock that I should have purchased first 17 
years ago. Texas Instruments is an absolute	2600.82	8.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	giant, with about three-quarters of their business 
dedicated to analog chips, making them ready for	2609.58	8.64
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	the upcoming boom in automotive technology 
and, to a lesser extent, industrial robotics.	2618.22	5.94
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	They have a broad portfolio of sensors, power 
chips, and anything analog. Texas Instruments	2624.94	11.46
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	is probably there. They also have a fantastic 
manufacturing base to work from, and they have	2636.4	6.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	some of the lowest costs in the industry 
– not just in manufacturing chips, but in	2642.82	9.96
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	manufacturing overall. They have done an excellent 
job of driving down their costs, resulting in	2652.78	5.22
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	ridiculously high profit margins. Therefore, 
I believe TXN is an excellent choice for the	2658.0	6.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	semiconductor industry, even though it is almost 
two decades since I should have bought it.	2665.62	2.486
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:39:07] Nicholas Rossolillo: I am beginning 
to warm up to this one. It was a commoditized	2668.106	3.754
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	business when I first purchased it many years 
ago, but today, with the emergence of electric	2672.4	7.68
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	vehicles and renewable energy, there is a new type 
of chip substrate called silicon carbide. Silicone	2680.08	7.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	is almost synonymous with a chip itself, and 
silicon carbide has carbon blended into the mix,	2689.92	11.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	making it able to handle much higher voltages and 
heat, making it an ideal type of chip for EVs and	2701.68	9.3
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	renewable energy. ON Semiconductor is pouring 
a lot of investment into silicon carbide (SiC),	2710.98	8.886
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	which is a really exciting development. 
Additionally, there is a small equipment	2719.866	3.114
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	chip company called Air Test Systems, in which 
I have a small position, that provides equipment	2724.0	7.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	that is essentially quality control for silicon 
carbide chips. I believe this is a compelling	2731.8	5.64
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	opportunity that could benefit significantly 
from a growing automotive technology market.	2737.44	6.24
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:40:06] Rebecca Hotsko: I 
feel like Texas Instruments is	2743.68	3.3
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	one that is not super popular. I don’t 
know, maybe that’s just what I read,	2746.98	4.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	but it doesn’t seem like it’s as popular 
as TSM or Nvidia and other ones like that,	2751.18	5.1
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	which benefit investors because typically 
then the price isn’t as high. It’s not run up.	2756.28	4.92
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:40:23] Nicholas Rossolillo: 
You’re absolutely right.	2761.2	2.908
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:40:24] Nicholas Rossolillo: It’s fantastic, 
I think it’s a fantastic value right now.	2764.108	3.632
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	It’s one I have considered adding to my portfolio. 
Yeah. It’s just not one of those sexy, high, super	2768.7	9.72
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	high growth logic chip names like Nvidia. Or AMD, 
but I think that’s a real shame because they’re,	2778.42	7.74
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	they’re, they’re actually forecasting compound 
annual growth of 10% a year through 2030.	2786.16	6.96
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:40:49] Nicholas Rossolillo: There’s nothing 
wrong with average revenue growth of 10% a year.	2793.12	3.78
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Plus Texas Instruments has this long standing 
policy of returning 100% of their free cash	2796.9	7.14
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	flow to shareholders. So all of a sudden you’re 
looking at an investment that is probably going	2804.04	5.64
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	to compound at, you know, a mid-teens percentage 
on average for the better part of a decade.	2809.68	6.42
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:41:10] Nicholas Rossolillo: That’s a 
pretty good long-term investment if you ask me.	2816.1	3.6
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:41:14] Rebecca Hotsko: Yeah. And so we 
talked about so many different companies today	2819.7	5.1
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	and you made such a great case for all of them in 
these different industries where they can capture	2824.8	5.52
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	more market share. And I guess I’m wondering, 
given that and kind of the near term risks that	2830.32	4.98
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	could be ahead, which do you think are the best 
value right now and for a long-term investor?	2835.3	6.753
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:41:33] Rebecca Hotsko: Because we’re not 
looking to sell it in two years or something,	2842.053	2.727
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	but which ones do you think are the best price 
right now for a value investor to scoop up?	2844.78	5.64
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:41:42] Nicholas Rossolillo: Yeah, Texas 
Instruments is compelling. I think in addition	2850.42	8.28
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	to that, I do like Qualcomm. Obviously, the 
smartphone market is not a super high-growth	2858.7	8.64
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	market like it was the last two decades, but 
there is still gonna be some growth there.	2867.34	4.38
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:41:59] Nicholas Rossolillo: In addition to 
that, Qualcomm is actually taking everything	2871.72	4.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	it does in smartphones and now applying it to the 
automotive industry. So they’re, they’re actually	2875.74	6.72
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	developing and getting some really good success 
selling their logic ships into automobiles.	2882.46	7.8
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	In addition to that, they do have a small software 
component as well attached to that auto business.	2891.52	5.128
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:42:21] Nicholas Rossolillo: I think Qualcomm 
is very cheap, and it’s kind of been left for	2896.648	5.192
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	dead here as of late because of the decline 
in smartphone sales. But that’s gonna come	2901.84	5.52
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	back eventually. And along the way, they’re 
getting some nice growth from automotive.	2907.36	5.4
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:42:39] Nicholas Rossolillo: I think AMD is 
still very compelling as well, even though it’s	2913.72	4.12
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	this darling from the 2010s, they completely 
turned their business around and overtook	2918.4	5.22
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	Intel on so many different fronts. But I do still 
like this company. They are so far ahead in CPU	2923.62	8.22
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	technology specifically for data centers. Intel 
still has like an installed base of over 90%	2932.5	7.86
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	for data centers for the cloud.	2941.56	2.94
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:43:05] Nicholas Rossolillo: So as these 
companies need to update the equipment,	2944.5	4.92
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	because chips eventually, they either wear out 
and need replaced, or the technology has just	2949.42	5.16
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	advanced so much that a company is forced 
to rip it out and replace it with something	2954.58	4.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	new as they rip out the old Intel hardware. I 
think there’s a really compelling argument to	2958.6	9.54
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	be made that AMD continues to gobble up market 
share at Intel’s expense in the next decade.	2968.14	5.488
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:43:35] Nicholas Rossolillo: So 
I think they’re not participating	2973.628	2.912
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	as much in the accelerated computing 
part of the market like Nvidia is,	2976.54	4.2
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	but the CPU space is going to grow, 
I think substantially because of data	2981.76	7.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	centers and AI. And so I think AMD is also a 
compelling value for the next decade as well.	2988.78	4.86
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:43:56] Rebecca Hotsko: And then what about,	2993.64	2.34
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	are there any companies that you talked about 
today that you love but not at this price?	2995.98	6.0
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:44:04] Nicholas Rossolillo: I love Nvidia. 
I don’t love the price. That’s the most obvious	3001.98	8.52
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	one right now. But again, I think we’re at this 
particular point where even if the price, if the	3010.5	9.84
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	valuation, I should say, not the price, not the 
stock price, if the valuation feels uncomfortable,	3020.34	4.56
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	it’s really important to remember 
the semiconductor businesses. They	3026.52	3.96
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	have such farsighted vision because 
it’s expensive to manufacture chips.	3030.48	4.02
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:44:31] Nicholas Rossolillo: They’re 
laying plans down for two, three, five,	3034.5	5.76
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	10 years down the road with their customers, 
with their partners. So we really have to look	3040.26	7.08
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	at valuation one year or more out to 
effectively value what a fair price is	3047.34	6.6
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	to buy a chip stock today. So I would say 
overall, there are a lot of very attractive,	3054.78	5.22
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	attractively priced, attractively valued companies 
in the semiconductor market at the moment.	3060.0	5.28
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:45:00] Rebecca Hotsko: That was excellent. 
I think I’ll end it there. And I wanna thank	3065.28	7.56
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	you so much for coming on today. I learned a 
ton from this conversation and I’m excited to	3072.84	4.62
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	watch more of your YouTube videos and keep up to 
date with this industry. But before I let you go,	3077.46	5.1
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	where can our audience go to learn more 
about you and everything that you do?	3082.56	3.78
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:45:17] Nicholas Rossolillo: So 
the primary outlet these days for all	3086.34	6.12
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	of our research is the YouTube 
channel “Chip Stock Investor.”	3092.46	4.08
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	[00:45:24] Rebecca Hotsko: 
Perfect. I will make sure	3096.54	2.28
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	to link that in the show notes for our listeners.	3098.82	2.16
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	I don't like Apple the reason why I feel that is 
just the structural advantages that Google has so	3102.18	5.4
eUIm_PucV9A	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIm_PucV9A	I'll go into more of why I like Google and I'll 
share a little concrete tip for your listeners.	3107.58	4.68
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	a question that I get a lot is to do a	0.24	5.099

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	right now	28.08	3.599
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	the three green marked stocks are my	29.099	4.441
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	biggest positions which I will cover in	31.679	3.841
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	a minute let's start with the sector	33.54	3.359
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	classification	35.52	4.68
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	roughly 24 of my portfolio is invested	36.899	6.0
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	in reads it's not the biggest sector in	40.2	4.8
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	this portfolio but it's definitely the	42.899	4.141
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	one that brings in the highest amount of	45.0	4.52
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	dividends the next sector is Tech	47.04	6.24
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	representing 15 and consisting some	49.52	6.219
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	dividend growth stocks	53.28	4.68
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	health is by far the smallest sector	55.739	3.96
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	with only four percent	57.96	4.38
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	Services is the biggest segment with 26	59.699	5.401
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	percent and has a broad variety of	62.34	4.5
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	different companies	65.1	4.559
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	as of right now I only have one ETF in	66.84	6.26
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	my portfolio which is the S P 500 ETF	69.659	6.301

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	everything I decided to do it this way	86.34	6.12
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	on the left we see the breakdown on the	90.42	4.14

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	as of right now I only own 15 different	94.56	6.3
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	stocks I used to own 20 to 30 stocks but	97.259	5.521
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	I locked in some profits and decided to	100.86	4.619
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	trim down the amount of different stocks	102.78	5.28
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	my guest position isn't included in this	105.479	4.381
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	list since I will create a separate	108.06	3.72
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	video very soon	109.86	4.32
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	as I told a minute ago three stocks are	111.78	4.74
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	highlighted in this list since they are	114.18	5.04
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	the biggest amount of share Microsoft	116.52	5.04

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	my smallest position is Texas Roadhouse	132.84	5.58
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	with only two percent which is very	135.379	5.381

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	only three percent of my portfolio and	172.019	4.561
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	the reason being the high risk High	174.84	4.08

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	the reason why I invested in this stock	189.48	5.039
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	is because of the dividends I think it's	191.94	4.56
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	one of the first stocks that I invested	194.519	2.761
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	in	196.5	3.42
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	my average cost price is around 13 so	197.28	5.28
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	I'm down in this one but to be honest I	199.92	3.899
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	don't care that much	202.56	3.72
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	it's all about a dividend with this one	203.819	4.621
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	Divinity Guild is sitting at almost 16	206.28	5.52
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	and to be honest this is insane when I	208.44	5.28
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	started my position I think dividend was	211.8	4.38
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	around seven percent which was already a	213.72	3.84
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	bit on the high side	216.18	3.24
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	but since the stock price has come down	217.56	3.539
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	quite a lot lately the difference yield	219.42	3.36
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	has increased all the way up to almost	221.099	3.601
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	16 percent	222.78	5.099
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	payout ratio is at 93 indicate it could	224.7	5.52
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	be a risk investing in this company	227.879	4.021
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	the fall of your growth rate isn't that	230.22	3.599
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	spectacular to be honest	231.9	4.5
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	but who needs growth right now when	233.819	5.041
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	dividend yield is this high they grew	236.4	5.28
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	the difference for two consecutive years	238.86	5.099
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	my final conclusion already capital is	241.68	4.619
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	that it's a high risk High reward	243.959	4.681

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	of the increasing payout ratio	250.2	3.84
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	especially with interest rates	252.14	3.28
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	increasing now	254.04	4.08
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	this company might be at risk in the	255.42	4.439
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	coming period I will decide whether or	258.12	3.899
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	not to sell this stock for now I will	259.859	4.321

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	dividends	290.82	4.02
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	stack industrial is a 5.97 billion	291.96	4.86

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	smaller sized company	296.82	4.2
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	PE ratio isn't a fair metric to use with	298.56	4.32
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	reads so I will be using the price to	301.02	5.04
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	ffo which is sitting at 15. a decent	302.88	4.98
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	number for a rate	306.06	4.139
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	the reason why I invested in this stock	307.86	5.04
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	is because of the monthly dividends I	310.199	4.321

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	around 30 so I'm up roughly 10 in terms	317.1	4.08
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	of stock price	319.919	3.241
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	but as I just said it's more about the	321.18	3.42
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	dividends for me	323.16	3.66
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	dividend yield is sitting at 4.4 percent	324.6	4.14
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	and the best thing about stack is the	326.82	3.96
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	fact that they pay a monthly dividend	328.74	4.14
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	the payout ratio displayed here isn't	330.78	4.139
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	correct since reads use ffo to pay out	332.88	4.56
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	the dividend the actual payout ratio is	334.919	5.701
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	66 which is a great number for a read	337.44	4.979
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	The Five-Year growth rate isn't that	340.62	4.859
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	spectacular to be honest but who needs	342.419	4.62

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	my final conclusion on stack is that I	352.74	4.62
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	love the business I do think the stock	355.199	4.141
KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	could be undervalued right now and with	357.36	3.839

KjKMod_HSq4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKMod_HSq4	is because of the monthly dividends it's	529.98	4.44
